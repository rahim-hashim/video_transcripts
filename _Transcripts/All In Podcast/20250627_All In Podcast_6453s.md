# 12 Day War, Socialism Wins in NYC, Stocks All-Time High, AI Copyright, Science Corner
**All In Podcast:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs)
*  Did you guys see this White House video? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=0.0s)]
*  Oh, is there a White House video? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3.16s)]
*  I honestly think that was the funniest post [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5.24s)]
*  by a White House ever was the daddy's home video. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=8.36s)]
*  When you say daddy's home. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=11.98s)]
*  Oh. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=14.6s)]
*  I feel like popping bottles to this. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=15.620000000000001s)]
*  Come on now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Up in the club. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=18.36s)]
*  Oh, in the VIP. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=20.04s)]
*  Popping bottles with the rain man. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=21.96s)]
*  Let's buy two bottles of that Paul in tequila. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=24.52s)]
*  Get a double. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=29.12s)]
*  That is the best. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  The backstory to that is that Mark Ruto, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=32.28s)]
*  who's the secretary general of NATO, called Trump daddy [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=34.32s)]
*  at the summit. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=36.8s)]
*  Yeah, he called him daddy. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  That got weird. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  Raymrag, you missed it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  We were just up in the club. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=42.36s)]
*  You want to go back to the club for a second? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=43.72s)]
*  I do. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=45.28s)]
*  I love the club. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=45.84s)]
*  You ready? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=46.52s)]
*  I love the club. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=47.08s)]
*  Popping some bottles with the NATO summit. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  We're doing it again. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=49.96s)]
*  Come on, Friedberg. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=51.52s)]
*  Let me see you stand up, Friedberg. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=53.68000000000001s)]
*  You're Sultan of science. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=57.32s)]
*  What club are we going to this weekend? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=60.24s)]
*  Oh, daddy's home. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  We are going to bring the club to us. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=63.84s)]
*  I think it's called Club NATO. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=66.04s)]
*  Sash, can you get the hall pass? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=67.28s)]
*  You want to come to Vegas this weekend? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=68.4s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=70.08s)]
*  Let's talk about it off camera. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=70.58s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=72.12s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=72.62s)]

*  Whoa. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=73.62s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=74.12s)]
*  J. Cal, come out. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=74.88s)]
*  Where are you? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=75.8s)]
*  Pop on a Southwest flight. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=76.4s)]
*  Meet us in Vegas. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=77.64s)]
*  Southwest flight. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=78.72s)]
*  I'm going to leave. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=80.2s)]
*  Let your winter slide. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=83.68s)]
*  Rain man, David Satterson. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=86.36s)]
*  I'm going to leave. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=87.84s)]
*  And as said, we open source it to the fans, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=90.32s)]
*  and they've just gone crazy with it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=92.8s)]
*  Love you, guys. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=94.28s)]

*  I'm going to leave. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=96.52s)]
*  All right, everybody. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=98.92s)]
*  Welcome back to the number one podcast in the world, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=99.8s)]
*  the All In Podcast, your favorite podcast. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=103.48s)]
*  We're back. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=105.68s)]
*  We've got the original quartet here. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=106.2s)]
*  And everybody's really excited because we [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=108.88s)]
*  had a fun time on Saturday night. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=110.8s)]
*  What a party. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=114.08s)]
*  We had a Delilah. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=115.12s)]
*  All four besties there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=117.08s)]
*  Step and repeat. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  Freberg, you lost a bunch of money [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=120.64s)]
*  playing bomb pots with me and Rob Goldberg. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=123.2s)]
*  You drank a lot. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=125.84s)]
*  You looked great. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=127.28s)]
*  Your impressions of this evening? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=128.96s)]
*  Oh, I loved it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=133.24s)]
*  It was great. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  I think the tequila turned out fantastic. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=134.56s)]
*  This tequila has been, I mean, you guys realize when we first [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  started talking about this, this was like 2 and 1 [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=140.16s)]
*  almost three years ago when we first started talking about this. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=143.0s)]
*  And it is finally here. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  It took forever to get through this kind of design development [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=149.16000000000003s)]
*  process. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=153.8s)]
*  But man, I think it turned out great. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=154.28s)]
*  I thought it was awesome. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=155.72s)]
*  Everybody at the party was surprised by how good it was [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=157.32000000000002s)]
*  because they thought that, I don't know, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=160.12s)]
*  we were just doing this as a gimmick or something. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=162.12s)]
*  But we actually put in the time to make it great. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=164.32000000000002s)]
*  A lot of time. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=166.32000000000002s)]
*  A lot of time. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  So talk a little bit about the sourcing [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=168.12s)]
*  because I think that sourcing was very important. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=170.8s)]
*  Well, we went down to Tequila, Mexico. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  There's only one part of Mexico that's even [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=176.96s)]
*  allowed to be called Tequila. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=178.72s)]
*  And we found a distillery that had been aging some agave [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=181.24s)]
*  in American oak whiskey barrels for five years. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=187.44s)]
*  And normally, Exterran Yejo is aged for three years. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  So it was pretty rare to find a cache of five-year age. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=194.0s)]
*  And so we basically bought it all. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=199.08s)]
*  But there's only enough for 7,500 bottles. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=200.48s)]
*  So that's what we did. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=202.28s)]
*  But this is not about creating some large, new Tequila label. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=203.68s)]
*  This is more about creating something that we ourselves [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=209.16s)]
*  like. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=212.12s)]
*  And that's what we did, a small batch product. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=212.64s)]
*  I mean, the money is not going to change anyone's life, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=215.72s)]
*  except maybe yours. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=217.92s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=219.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=221.28s)]
*  Uber hit another record today. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=221.8s)]
*  So with Uber past 88, you guys are all, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=223.28s)]
*  I don't need to be here anymore. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=226.52s)]
*  But look, we do things because they're fun. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=228.96s)]
*  And it was fun to create this. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=230.72s)]
*  Here, I've got the. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=232.08s)]
*  It is fun. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=232.96s)]
*  It was really fun. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=233.84s)]
*  Well, look at this thing. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=235.0s)]
*  Beautiful box, slides open. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  It's backlit in the box. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  So that out of the box experience is just amazing. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=241.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great unboxing. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=244.16s)]
*  Steve Jobs would be proud. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=245.68s)]
*  Tell us about the bottle design. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=246.76000000000002s)]
*  That was a lot of work, Sax. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=248.96s)]
*  I think this probably took an extra six months [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=250.76000000000002s)]
*  to get this right, if I'm recalling correctly [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=253.28s)]
*  on the schedule. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  This is super complicated to execute. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=256.96s)]
*  Well, the bottle is designed after a stack of poker chips. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=259.28s)]
*  And so you can see it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=262.56s)]
*  The chips are stacked and there are a jar. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=263.56s)]
*  So it's like highly, it's a lot of texture here. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=265.47999999999996s)]
*  It's made with glass. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  And then there's these black chip accents [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=269.24s)]
*  that are actually painted onto the bottle perfectly. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=272.4s)]
*  So this took a lot to get right. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=275.28s)]
*  We went through a lot of prototypes to get this. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=277.84s)]
*  And it just looks amazing. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=279.79999999999995s)]
*  All right, there you have it, folks. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=282.4s)]
*  The all in tequila has promised. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  It's finally available on our website. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=285.68s)]
*  So if you go to tequila.allin.com, you can now buy it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=288.6s)]
*  There's only 7,500 bottles. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=292.8s)]
*  I think we're only gonna sell 6,000 [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=294.56s)]
*  because we're gonna keep the rest [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=297.2s)]
*  for our own personal stash. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=298.16s)]
*  We've sold a good chunk already. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=299.0s)]
*  So they're going really fast. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=301.24s)]
*  We just opened up the website. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=302.32s)]
*  Previously, they were only available to people [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  who had attended the All In Summit. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=306.4s)]
*  They could pre-order it and reserve. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=307.66s)]
*  But now the website is open. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=309.54s)]
*  Oh, wow, beautiful. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=311.12s)]
*  Okay, there you go. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=312.88s)]
*  What are your bottle limit to two? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=314.56s)]
*  And go have that, folks. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=317.04s)]
*  This is not a cheap product. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=318.96s)]
*  But if you look at the peer competitor for this product [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=320.52s)]
*  is the Clausser Zoll Ultra, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=324.68s)]
*  which I think sells at $1,700 a bottle. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  Although sometimes I've seen it sell [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=329.88s)]
*  for as much as 3,000 a bottle. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=331.08s)]
*  So we're priced competitively with that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=332.48s)]
*  There you go. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=334.52s)]
*  And each of those boxes, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=335.36s)]
*  and when you open it up, the lights up, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=336.92s)]
*  and you can recharge it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=339.18s)]
*  So it's a keepsake, right? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=340.16s)]
*  There's a charging port in the box [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=341.16s)]
*  so that it never runs out of the battery [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=343.24s)]
*  to power the light. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=345.88s)]
*  So genius, so genius. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=346.72s)]
*  I love that little touch. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=347.88s)]
*  All right, folks, there's tons in the new, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=348.98s)]
*  look at this. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=351.52s)]
*  I'm sure it's coming. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=352.36s)]
*  I mean, before we get to World War III, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=354.16s)]
*  let's get the room, sir. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=357.8s)]
*  Is that the beep, beep, beep that out? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=359.24s)]
*  Chamath, did you want a side of caviar [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=361.12s)]
*  with your besties all in tequila? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=362.7s)]
*  Listen, being an elitist, guys, is very hard. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=366.16s)]
*  That's why I was tweeting how stressful it is. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=368.68s)]
*  Somebody was saying that we weren't living up [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=370.32s)]
*  to our job as being the elite. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=373.44s)]
*  And I was like, man, this is, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=375.64s)]
*  it's really stressful being an elite. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=376.76s)]
*  It's very stressful. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=378.23999999999995s)]
*  We need a drink. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=379.08s)]
*  Absolutely, I'll take a double. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=380.44s)]
*  You have no idea. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=381.91999999999996s)]
*  So did you go with, on your eggs bernay's there, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=382.79999999999995s)]
*  did you go with the truffles or the caviar? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=385.96s)]
*  What did you do? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=387.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, I, you know, honestly, I went quite healthy. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=388.76s)]
*  I have some avocado. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=392.84s)]
*  Okay, very nice. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=395.08s)]
*  I have mango. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=395.91999999999996s)]
*  And I have some eggs. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  Where are my eggs? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=400.79999999999995s)]
*  $32, okay. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=401.8s)]
*  David, do you wanna see my pillows [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  with my initials on them? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=404.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=405.8s)]
*  Oh Lord, here we go. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=406.64s)]
*  This is the best thing that the does. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  Shout out to our friends at Politico, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=410.03999999999996s)]
*  how out of touch we are. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=412.91999999999996s)]
*  Look, Sax, they always put my initials. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=414.03999999999996s)]
*  They do that for you? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=416.47999999999996s)]
*  They do that for me. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=417.59999999999997s)]
*  Isn't that incredible? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  Okay, here we go. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  All right, there's lots to discuss in the news. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=421.71999999999997s)]
*  We'll shift from conspicuous consumption [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=424.32s)]
*  and talk about the 12 day war between Israel and Iran. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=427.52s)]
*  It's two weeks later, obviously. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  Quick recap here and then we'll get the besties take [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=433.84s)]
*  on where we're at today, June 26th when we tape this. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=436.03999999999996s)]
*  Friday, June 13th, Israel launched a surprise attack, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=439.96s)]
*  took out a bunch of Iranian military officials, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=443.15999999999997s)]
*  some folks who work on the nuclear program [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=447.15999999999997s)]
*  and they traded missiles for about a week [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=449.35999999999996s)]
*  before everybody debating if this was gonna be World War III [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=451.52s)]
*  and on Saturday, June 21st, quite shockingly, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=455.59999999999997s)]
*  the US jumped in and carried out Operation Midnight, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=457.76s)]
*  I've had a couple of weekends in Vegas [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=462.2s)]
*  that had been called Midnight Hammer. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=463.68s)]
*  Oh, yes, Midnight Hammer, also known. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=465.40000000000003s)]
*  Wow, there we go, folks. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=469.52000000000004s)]
*  Over a dozen bunker buster bombs on two, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=471.6s)]
*  maybe three of Iran's key nuclear facilities, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=474.8s)]
*  Fordo and Natanz. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=477.88s)]
*  These bombs weigh 15 tons each, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=479.16s)]
*  they'll go deep underground, Israel doesn't have them [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=480.92s)]
*  and that's the reason we're given [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=483.88s)]
*  of why we were pulled into this [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=485.88s)]
*  is because we're the only people in the world [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=487.12s)]
*  who could have taken these out. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=488.56s)]
*  On Thursday morning, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Dan Cain, showed a video. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=490.6s)]
*  If you haven't seen it, folks, this came out this morning. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=496.96000000000004s)]
*  Here's the video. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=499.08000000000004s)]
*  It's a video of what they call a massive ordinance penetrator. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=500.08000000000004s)]
*  It basically goes through the ground. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=504.48s)]
*  I think in this case, it's going through a ventilation shaft, and it doesn't immediately [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=506.96000000000004s)]
*  go off. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=510.84000000000003s)]
*  It basically borrows to its maximum depth and then goes off. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=511.84000000000003s)]
*  This looks like a test to me. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=515.34s)]
*  This is just demonstrating it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=516.6800000000001s)]
*  This is a demonstration. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=517.82s)]
*  Demonstrating how it works. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=518.82s)]
*  And so here's the before and after photos you've probably seen. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=520.74s)]
*  Kind of hard to understand what's going on here, except for the discoloration. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=523.6600000000001s)]
*  Obviously we're going for things underground. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=526.7800000000001s)]
*  And then, shockingly, Iran did a, I don't know what you'd call this, a ceremonial response [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=529.7800000000001s)]
*  sacks, where they sent some missiles to one of our bases in Qatar. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=536.5400000000001s)]
*  They gave us a ton of notice. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=540.1400000000001s)]
*  None of them landed. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=541.7800000000001s)]
*  And then both countries have been bombing each other a little bit after Trump said he [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=543.7s)]
*  negotiated a ceasefire, which made our president a little bit upset. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=548.5799999999999s)]
*  Here's the clip of the president not dropping a Moab, but dropping an F-bomb. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=554.3399999999999s)]
*  Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=559.5s)]
*  the likes of which I've never seen before. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=563.8199999999999s)]
*  The biggest load that we've seen. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=566.0999999999999s)]
*  I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=567.86s)]
*  You know, when I say, OK, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=569.6999999999999s)]
*  and just drop everything you have on them. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=574.3s)]
*  So I'm not happy with them. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=576.2199999999999s)]
*  I'm not happy with Iran either. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=577.9s)]
*  We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=579.46s)]
*  don't know what the fuck they're doing. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=584.98s)]
*  Do you understand that? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=586.86s)]
*  Trump is not happy. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=590.1s)]
*  He did the lean in. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=591.5s)]
*  Did you notice the lean in there, Sax, when he dropped the F-bomb? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=592.38s)]
*  Well, in fairness, President Trump's not the first president to drop an F-bomb in [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=595.26s)]
*  frustration with Netanyahu. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=600.62s)]
*  It was reported back in the 90s that Bill Clinton, when he had to deal with Netanyahu, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=603.6600000000001s)]
*  was being very obstinate and was basically rejecting all of Clinton's entreaties and [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=609.74s)]
*  plans. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=615.86s)]
*  Clinton is reported to have said, who's the fucking superpower here, you know, in [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=616.58s)]
*  frustration? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=620.0200000000001s)]
*  So this is not the first time that an American president has gotten frustrated with [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=620.7s)]
*  Netanyahu. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=625.46s)]
*  But I think people reacted quite well to that on the whole, because it showed that [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=626.7800000000001s)]
*  President Trump was willing to... [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=630.62s)]
*  He cares. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=632.58s)]
*  Well, first of all, he negotiated this ceasefire, which was amazing. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=632.94s)]
*  Then what happens is that there was this deadline and it's like in a fight where they [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=637.38s)]
*  ring the bell and the fighters keep slugging with each other. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=642.74s)]
*  It's like they both want to get a few extra hits in. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=645.66s)]
*  And that's what... [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=648.86s)]
*  Last licks. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=650.02s)]
*  Yeah, they got some last licks in. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=650.74s)]
*  But President Trump negotiated the ceasefire, which was extraordinary. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=652.7s)]
*  And then he's willing to reprimand Israel for basically violating the ceasefire, too, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=655.82s)]
*  which you have to do if you want to enforce it. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=659.6600000000001s)]
*  So I think that's basically what happened there. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=661.74s)]
*  Now, you, Sax, I'm sure the audience wants to challenge you on this. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=663.7s)]
*  You were, hey, Trump is never get involved in forever wars. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=668.14s)]
*  Obviously, it looks like this might not be a forever war, which would be fantastic if [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=672.26s)]
*  that turns out to be the case. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=675.3000000000001s)]
*  And you were saying, hey, the reason to vote for Trump is he won't get us into another [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=677.34s)]
*  war. And here we go. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=682.38s)]
*  And obviously, Tucker, Halsey, there's a number of people who are... [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=684.3s)]
*  Did not want to do this. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=688.74s)]
*  And you were one of them. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=690.26s)]
*  So how do you reconcile all of this as somebody who did not want to see us do this? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=691.42s)]
*  President Trump accomplished that. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=697.2199999999999s)]
*  We're not in a forever war. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=698.3s)]
*  We're not in a war with Iran. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=699.38s)]
*  You look at Mark Levin today. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=701.38s)]
*  He's apoplectic because he and people like him were advocating for a regime change war. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=702.6999999999999s)]
*  And they felt like this was the perfect opportunity to drag the United States into such a [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=707.62s)]
*  war. And President Trump resisted that and instead negotiated a ceasefire. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=711.46s)]
*  So it seems to me that he lived up to exactly his promises on this. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=715.7s)]
*  Look, I think President Trump had to thread a very difficult needle here. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=719.86s)]
*  If you look at polling, the vast majority of the American population believe in two [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=724.4200000000001s)]
*  things. Number one, they don't want Iran getting a nuclear weapon by like 80 something [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=729.34s)]
*  percent. They also, by 80 something percent, don't want to get dragged into a new [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=733.5s)]
*  forever war in the Middle East. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=737.94s)]
*  Right. They don't want to be in a long-term. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=739.3000000000001s)]
*  But they do want to be able to drag a war with Iran. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=741.5400000000001s)]
*  President Trump managed to accomplish both those objectives. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=744.86s)]
*  He took out the Iranian nuclear sites in these highly precise targeted strikes, but he [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=747.7s)]
*  did not get dragged into a new Middle Eastern war. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=753.6600000000001s)]
*  In fact, he negotiated a ceasefire and at least an end to the war right now between [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=756.9000000000001s)]
*  Israel and Iran. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=762.1s)]
*  I think there's very few leaders who could have threaded this needle. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=763.38s)]
*  Imagine if Kamala Harris were president, just do the counterfactual. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=765.94s)]
*  So it's interesting that there seems to be this kind of a social awareness to realize [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=769.0600000000001s)]
*  that when the Iranians struck at our base in Qatar, that it was performative, that it [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=773.58s)]
*  was telegraphed, and that it was meant to basically be for domestic consumption and [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=779.0200000000001s)]
*  end the war. She might have escalated it. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=783.5s)]
*  Certainly, you know, a lot of the neocons who are on social media were saying, this [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=786.46s)]
*  is our chance. Right. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=790.26s)]
*  When the Iranians engaged in that performative hit on on Qatar, they were saying, we [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=791.4200000000001s)]
*  got to escalate. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=797.0600000000001s)]
*  Trump, he had the overall awareness of the situation to avoid that. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=797.94s)]
*  And this goes back to his experience with Soleimani back in the first Trump administration. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=802.1s)]
*  The Iranians did the same thing where they fired some missiles at American bases, but [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=806.1400000000001s)]
*  they were telegraphed. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=810.1800000000001s)]
*  We were told in advance they were coming. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=811.46s)]
*  They were easy to avoid. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=813.1800000000001s)]
*  No Americans got harmed. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=814.5200000000001s)]
*  And then Trump ended the conflict there. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=816.1800000000001s)]
*  And I think that a lot of presidents might have gotten sucked in to a new Middle Eastern [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=818.82s)]
*  war. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=823.5400000000001s)]
*  Let me pull you in here. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=824.54s)]
*  Obviously little cognitive dissonance. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=826.2199999999999s)]
*  Folks didn't want to go to war, but we don't want WMDs in the hands of Iran. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=829.6999999999999s)]
*  How do you reconcile all of this? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=835.26s)]
*  Is the outcome make it okay in your mind, or would you rather have seen me not get involved [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=836.6999999999999s)]
*  in this? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=841.18s)]
*  Can I uplevel this slightly? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=842.18s)]
*  I think that this has been probably the most important week and I would almost say most [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=843.54s)]
*  important few months in US politics in 30 or 40 years. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=852.6999999999999s)]
*  And the reason is that it starts to converge a bunch of things together that I think are [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=858.66s)]
*  really worth putting on the table. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=864.06s)]
*  So from my perspective, I think what President Trump has done is almost single handedly [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=865.9399999999999s)]
*  bring back the United States as the global superpower. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=871.48s)]
*  And I would put that in all caps. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=877.66s)]
*  So what does it mean to be a superpower? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=879.98s)]
*  I've said this several times, but just to be slightly redundant. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=881.7s)]
*  In order to be a superpower, I think you need to have three things, but they work in a hierarchy. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=886.1s)]
*  The first is that you need to have technical supremacy. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=891.5s)]
*  And then from that technological supremacy, you need to establish and project economic [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=894.6600000000001s)]
*  supremacy and military supremacy. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=900.6600000000001s)]
*  So if you look at the first one, you saw a tactical demonstration of technological supremacy [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=904.3000000000001s)]
*  with the B-2 bombers. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=908.6600000000001s)]
*  But taking a more general step back, if you look at the largest companies in the world, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=910.0600000000001s)]
*  who are the ones that are actually driving the world forward? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=914.86s)]
*  These are all American companies. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=918.5400000000001s)]
*  I think these last few months, you've seen America firing on all cylinders technologically. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=920.26s)]
*  Economically, at the same time, you now have the stock market back at all time highs. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=927.26s)]
*  You have interest rates incredibly starting to compress, even in the absence of the Federal [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=932.1s)]
*  Reserve willing to act on data. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=937.46s)]
*  So you're projecting economic supremacy. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=940.0600000000001s)]
*  And then these last few weeks, frankly, have been a pretty clear cut case of military supremacy. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=942.94s)]
*  And so I think what's pretty simple now is like the US is essentially telling the world [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=948.3000000000001s)]
*  our words carry weight again, we're going to shape the global order. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=953.4200000000001s)]
*  Countries will now have to calibrate their actions around what the US is willing to tolerate [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=958.82s)]
*  and what it isn't willing to tolerate. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=964.22s)]
*  In the case of Iran, the president made those lines, I think, really crystal clear. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=966.66s)]
*  He warned them a hundred times where the line was. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=971.78s)]
*  And he was clear, you cannot build nuclear weapons. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=975.58s)]
*  And when the line was crossed, and look, I think the CNNs of the world want to debate [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=978.3s)]
*  that the line wasn't crossed. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=984.18s)]
*  All I can tell you is I don't know because I don't have access to the intel. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=985.5s)]
*  I believe what he and Tulsi Gabbard and JD Vance and Marco Rubio and Pete Hegseth are [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=988.38s)]
*  saying is that they crossed the line and then he showed that he will use decisive military [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=994.02s)]
*  force when that happens. But then here's what's crazy. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1000.86s)]
*  And this is where I think you become a real superpower. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1003.54s)]
*  It's what happens after. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1006.0600000000001s)]
*  Once you cross the line, you notice that he doesn't try to humiliate or dominate Iran. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1008.5s)]
*  He tells Iran that he wants them to stabilize themselves. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1014.14s)]
*  He told them that he wants to see them trading oil with China. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1017.58s)]
*  He wants to see them improving the lives of their people because he realizes that a stable [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1021.3000000000001s)]
*  Iran is a stable Middle East. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1026.66s)]
*  So I think it's really amazing. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1028.8200000000002s)]
*  And then the fact that he was able to bring Israel and Iran, who's been on the verge of [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1030.94s)]
*  some kind of conflict for decades and broker a ceasefire, it's a really important moment, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1035.7s)]
*  I think, in American history. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1041.7s)]
*  I really do think that if you look at my little framework, it is the closest thing for us [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1042.78s)]
*  to being able to say that we are truly a clear cut, singular hegemon global superpower [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1048.3s)]
*  again. And that's really exciting. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1054.94s)]
*  Well, he did. He definitely did provide that golden bridge for Iran to to cross over to [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1057.3s)]
*  and maybe move into another phase. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1062.18s)]
*  But Freiburg, maybe you could still man the other side of this just for the discussion [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1063.78s)]
*  here. This could have gone another direction. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1067.3799999999999s)]
*  We could be sitting here and there could be terrorist attacks or sleeper cells in the [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1070.34s)]
*  United States. It could turn out when we do the postmortem here that they were in close [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1074.26s)]
*  to having a nuclear bomb and we did this and we got goaded into it. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1078.26s)]
*  So maybe obviously things have gone well to date, but things might not have. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1082.26s)]
*  So maybe you could still man the other side of this. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1086.14s)]
*  What's the argument for not having done this? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1088.54s)]
*  And what if things had gone another way? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1090.66s)]
*  How bad could this be? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1093.62s)]
*  I don't know if this is over. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1097.06s)]
*  So well, that's my point. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1099.62s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, we're kind of in the middle of a. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1100.66s)]
*  To their own adventure book here, and I've got to imagine. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1103.02s)]
*  That the Israelis and Netanyahu, who's been pretty vocal about this regime that's been [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1108.86s)]
*  shouting for decades now, death to Israel, death to the USA. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1116.1s)]
*  Needs to change is going to suddenly say, hey, let's take a beat and walk away from [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1121.54s)]
*  this and we'll all kind of have peace in the Middle East. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1127.02s)]
*  I think we've got to expect that there is another page that's coming. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1129.3s)]
*  And I don't know if you guys heard. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1132.34s)]
*  I don't know if it's genuine or if it's authentic or not. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1134.34s)]
*  Did you hear that audio of one of the kind of Mossad or IDF people calling an IRGC [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1136.66s)]
*  commander and telling him that he has 24 hours to leave Iran with his wife and child? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1142.3s)]
*  Did you guys hear that? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1147.7s)]
*  Yeah, I have not. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1148.3799999999999s)]
*  I saw it. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1149.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1149.94s)]
*  I mean, I heard it. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1150.42s)]
*  It's pretty incredible. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1152.06s)]
*  And. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1153.86s)]
*  It's pretty incredible. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1154.5s)]
*  And. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1156.14s)]
*  I've got to imagine that there's going to continue to be effort to destabilize whatever [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1157.94s)]
*  regime remains in Iran by Israel Mossad. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1162.66s)]
*  And this isn't going to be kind of a quiet, peaceful transition. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1167.14s)]
*  There's going to continue to be more conflict, whether these guys are going to be trading [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1171.6200000000001s)]
*  missiles back and forth tomorrow. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1174.5400000000002s)]
*  I think, you know, we don't really know, but this isn't over. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1176.22s)]
*  And I do think that the next set of actions is going to be critical. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1180.7800000000002s)]
*  But what I was pretty surprised by, I did not like everyone was saying, hey, we're on [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1184.38s)]
*  the brink of World War Three. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1188.5800000000002s)]
*  I mean, there was some serious statesmanship that must have gone on to keep China. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1189.8600000000001s)]
*  And I have no idea. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1195.7s)]
*  I've had no insight or conversations with anyone to give me any sort of proprietary [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1196.5400000000002s)]
*  access to knowledge about what's gone on here. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1201.22s)]
*  But I've got to imagine there were calls to China and Russia that kept them in the loop [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1202.94s)]
*  and kept them in play on how this all played out, because China and Russia, the whole [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1207.66s)]
*  sphere was this was going to create this magnet in the Middle East that everything was [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1212.46s)]
*  going to rush in and we're going to catalyze World War Three. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1215.26s)]
*  And it didn't happen. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1217.42s)]
*  So I do think that, you know, first of all, nothing that folks predicted actually happened [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1219.22s)]
*  and no one predicted what did happen. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1225.46s)]
*  So I'm not going to sit here and try to talk to you. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1227.66s)]
*  Right. I mean, and I'm not going to sit here and try and predict what happened next. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1229.94s)]
*  And I will say, if I'm thinking about, like, you know, game theory, optimal poker play, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1232.8600000000001s)]
*  I got to give credit to this president because it was completely unpredictable what was [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1237.42s)]
*  coming next. And I don't think that there was a really clear path on what he was going [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1242.26s)]
*  to do. Just like was what has happened repeatedly. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1246.06s)]
*  Everyone always slams a table and says he's starting World War Three. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1249.3s)]
*  He's driving economic collapse. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1252.1s)]
*  Everything's about to end. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1253.82s)]
*  And then it turns out he kind of ducks and weaves and finds his way through. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1255.26s)]
*  And everyone's like, holy shit, I didn't expect that to happen. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1259.98s)]
*  That was it's very unpredictable. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1262.34s)]
*  It's going to happen next. So I am not going to sit here and try and estimate what's going [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1264.06s)]
*  to happen next. I can tell you, I don't think the Israelis are going to sit by quietly and [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1267.02s)]
*  allow this Iranian regime to continue to go out and build up a military that's constantly [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1270.82s)]
*  shouting death to Israel, death to the USA. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1275.8999999999999s)]
*  And I think that they've taken their first shot and I don't think it's their last. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1278.1799999999998s)]
*  So we'll see how this all plays out. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1281.26s)]
*  I really don't know. I'm sure I'm sure that's right. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1282.86s)]
*  Let me just tee up one person who did get it right. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1284.9399999999998s)]
*  Here's John Mearsheimer at the Olin summit just nine months ago. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1287.02s)]
*  Let me play this clip here and get your reaction, Sax. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1291.74s)]
*  To counter the Iranian escalation scenario, the fact is Iran does not want a war with the United States [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1294.66s)]
*  and the United States does not want a war with Iran. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1302.8200000000002s)]
*  And it's the Israelis, especially Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been trying to sort of suck us [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1306.3400000000001s)]
*  into a war because he wants us, the United States, to really whack Iran, weaken it militarily, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1312.02s)]
*  and especially to go after its nuclear capabilities. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1319.94s)]
*  Because as you well know, they are close to the point where they can develop nuclear weapons. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1322.82s)]
*  So the Israelis are the ones who want us to get involved in a big war with Iran. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1327.94s)]
*  That's the escalation flashpoint. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1333.98s)]
*  And the $64,000 question is whether you think the United States and Iran kind of colluding can work [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1336.1s)]
*  together to prevent the Israelis from getting us. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1343.18s)]
*  So that question will be answered based on who leads the next administration. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1346.22s)]
*  Well, if you believe that it matters who leads the next administration, that's true. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1353.46s)]
*  And there, Sax, there's you laughing for this incredible insight, which is, as you were saying last year, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1358.66s)]
*  and Mearsheimer's been saying, this was manifest destiny. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1364.22s)]
*  This was going to happen no matter who was president. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1367.22s)]
*  And here we are. So your thoughts on Mearsheimer sort of, I mean, wow, he just nailed it there. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1369.78s)]
*  And that was to your question, Friedberg, by the way. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1375.02s)]
*  So well done to Friedberg. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1376.78s)]
*  We didn't put your question at the beginning because he went on for five or ten minutes there. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1378.1399999999999s)]
*  But go ahead, Sax, your reaction to Mearsheimer's incredible prediction. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1382.5s)]
*  That's Professor Mearsheimer being prophetic as usual. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1386.18s)]
*  But let me go back to a point that Friedberg was making. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1389.3799999999999s)]
*  To Friedberg's point here, this is not over. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1391.54s)]
*  Iran and Israel are mortal enemies. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1394.3s)]
*  And we have a ceasefire here. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1396.26s)]
*  We have a pause in the action, but it's going to flare up again at some point. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1397.5s)]
*  The question is what U.S. policy is going to be. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1401.5s)]
*  And I think that what President Trump did over the past two weeks is make it clear that, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1404.1799999999998s)]
*  number one, the United States does not want to see Iran get a nuclear bomb [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1408.82s)]
*  and that we are willing to take military action to prevent that. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1413.8999999999999s)]
*  But that that action will be narrowly targeted, as narrowly targeted as possible [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1417.3s)]
*  to achieve that objective. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1422.34s)]
*  Number two, that the United States does not have an interest in going to war [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1423.7399999999998s)]
*  to basically achieve a regime change. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1427.3799999999999s)]
*  If the people of Iran want to make Iran great again by rising up [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1430.6200000000001s)]
*  and toppling the government, then that's up to them. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1434.46s)]
*  Certainly, I think we would welcome that. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1436.58s)]
*  But the Trump administration rejected all of the calls over the past week or so [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1439.34s)]
*  for the United States to plunge into a regime change war in Iran. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1444.58s)]
*  And that's why the neocons right now are not happy at all. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1449.06s)]
*  So that's point number two. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1452.7s)]
*  Look, I think Trump found the right balance here, which is we are going to be [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1454.22s)]
*  narrowly focused on preventing a threat to the United States, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1457.82s)]
*  which is Iran having a nuclear bomb. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1462.1s)]
*  But we're not going to go plunging into another forever war, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1464.3799999999999s)]
*  another regime change operation. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1466.9399999999998s)]
*  We've had plenty of experience with that in the Middle East. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1468.58s)]
*  None of it worked. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1470.9399999999998s)]
*  Every time we went for a regime change, it backfired, backfired in Iraq, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1471.98s)]
*  Afghanistan, Libya and on and on. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1476.46s)]
*  There's no reason to believe regime change would work. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1479.3s)]
*  And by the way, there's no way to get regime change in a country [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1481.54s)]
*  unless you send an American GIs to basically keep that government [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1484.86s)]
*  propped up in power, because it's almost certainly going to be perceived [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1487.9799999999998s)]
*  as a puppet of the United States. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1491.7399999999998s)]
*  I mean, if you put, you know, raise up a lobby or something, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1493.9399999999998s)]
*  the Shah's son in power in Iran, he's going to face an insurgency right away. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1496.1399999999999s)]
*  And there's no way that his government is going to stay in power [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1501.8999999999999s)]
*  without the American military protecting him and keeping him in power [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1503.82s)]
*  at the end of a rifle barrel. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1507.1399999999999s)]
*  So this whole idea that you can achieve [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1508.62s)]
*  regime change without its evil twin, which is nation building, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1510.6999999999998s)]
*  is a total fantasy. You can't do it. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1514.26s)]
*  You would need an American occupation going on for decades. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1516.82s)]
*  And I think that the Trump administration wisely rejected [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1519.98s)]
*  all of this giddy talk. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1523.34s)]
*  Remember, in the first couple of days of that Israeli surprise attack [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1524.78s)]
*  where it was Israel who hit Iran and there was all this talk about decapitation, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1530.26s)]
*  that the Iranian regime was about to collapse. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1534.78s)]
*  It just needed a little bit of a push. Lindsey Graham. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1537.3s)]
*  Lindsey, that's what Lindsey Graham said. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1540.02s)]
*  That was all heady talk that turned out not to be true. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1541.66s)]
*  There's no question that the Iranian regime took some damage, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1545.5800000000002s)]
*  but they did not collapse. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1548.0600000000002s)]
*  And in fact, if you look at history, one of the things Mircea [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1549.3400000000001s)]
*  Amors pointed out is that you don't get regime change just through air power alone. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1552.94s)]
*  It takes boots on the ground. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1557.42s)]
*  And most Americans are not willing to put boots on the ground in Iran [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1559.14s)]
*  to change the regime there. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1563.78s)]
*  We believe that it's sufficient just to keep Iran from having a nuclear weapon. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1565.26s)]
*  That's what American policy should focus on. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1569.1000000000001s)]
*  I really felt for this. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1571.54s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1572.5s)]
*  Well, I really felt for this check raise from Trump, who was like, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1573.38s)]
*  yeah, no, we're not doing this. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1578.22s)]
*  We're not doing this. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1579.26s)]
*  And all of a sudden he does it right. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1580.22s)]
*  Nobody expected him to do it. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1582.1000000000001s)]
*  Everybody thought he was going to not intervene. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1583.42s)]
*  And I as a Gen X or like you, Saxon and I guess Freberg and Chamath as well. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1586.14s)]
*  When I saw them building the case here, the Lindsey Graham's, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1593.02s)]
*  you know, the Hawks, et cetera, reports of WMDs that were imminent, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1596.74s)]
*  who knows if that's true. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1601.22s)]
*  These people support terrorists. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1602.82s)]
*  They're trying to assassinate. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1604.82s)]
*  The president became part of this. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1606.06s)]
*  Remember that for last time with Bush, senior spreading democracy [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1608.18s)]
*  in the Middle East, the regime changed. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1611.58s)]
*  That made me all very nervous. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1613.22s)]
*  And I think the most important next step here is that this administration [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1614.58s)]
*  explain in detail to the American people. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1618.6200000000001s)]
*  So we don't have another WMD situation. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1621.6200000000001s)]
*  Just honestly, the truth. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1624.06s)]
*  Like, did we hit them? Did we hit some of them? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1625.5s)]
*  Was there imminent? Was it sort of imminent? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1628.1s)]
*  We just need to have full disclosure here. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1630.42s)]
*  I don't like the attacking the press for a leak inside of the administration. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1631.98s)]
*  It's the administration's, you know, responsibility to not have leaks. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1636.14s)]
*  And it's the press and the opposing party, whoever opposes this action [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1639.46s)]
*  to really vet this. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1644.18s)]
*  And we need that part of the democratic process. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1645.54s)]
*  I hope we don't shut that down and we just blindly follow, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1647.5800000000002s)]
*  you know, the leader because it went well, because this isn't over. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1650.7s)]
*  Number one. Number two, it did go well. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1654.94s)]
*  Huge credit to Trump for that. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1657.38s)]
*  If it does go well and he ends the war in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1659.02s)]
*  like give him the Peace Prize. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1663.66s)]
*  I'm all for it. Fantastic. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1665.46s)]
*  But let's get the disclosures here and let's not blame the press for getting a leak. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1667.66s)]
*  Let's actually look at this and explain to the American people [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1671.58s)]
*  what we accomplished, what didn't get accomplished and what the realistic [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1674.66s)]
*  next step is. And I give them a lot of credit for telling Israel [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1677.58s)]
*  where the line is and given the Golden Bridge to Iran. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1681.7s)]
*  They will have a revolution on their own timeline. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1685.9s)]
*  But we should not be part of that. Right. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1688.26s)]
*  That's the lesson we learned to your point, Sax. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1690.14s)]
*  We can't be the revolution in Iran. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1692.5s)]
*  They have to come from the bottom up. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1695.58s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1697.18s)]
*  May also disagree with one other thing you said, which is you said [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1697.82s)]
*  you were starting to get nervous about the stampede towards war. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1700.7s)]
*  I think you were correctly perceiving what was happening in the media. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1705.86s)]
*  I mean, and this includes Fox News, especially Fox News. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1709.02s)]
*  There was all this talk about how easy it would be. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1712.02s)]
*  It'd be a cakewalk that the government was on its last legs, that it was weak, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1714.1s)]
*  that it was basically almost topple. We just need to push it over. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1717.7s)]
*  You're right about the WMD talk, the talk about the assassination. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1720.54s)]
*  This is all like a literally like a carbon copy of the arguments [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1724.5s)]
*  that were made back in 2003. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1729.22s)]
*  It's the playbook to get us into the Iraq War. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1731.14s)]
*  But look, I think two things are different now. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1733.82s)]
*  Number one is President Trump is not George W. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1735.78s)]
*  Bush. I mean, that was made abundantly clear. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1738.46s)]
*  Number two is we now have alternative media [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1740.6200000000001s)]
*  that even though the mainstream media and Fox News was basically acting [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1744.1000000000001s)]
*  like this was 2003, you had alternative media and you had people [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1747.18s)]
*  like Tucker Carlson speaking out and Steve Bannon. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1750.66s)]
*  I have to give him credit on this and others who are who are pointing this out [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1752.8600000000001s)]
*  and making the case that this would not go well. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1757.6200000000001s)]
*  And I do think that it's been very helpful to have those [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1759.9s)]
*  chorus of voices as a rebuttal. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1763.3400000000001s)]
*  You know, you correctly felt that we were being pushed into war. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1766.26s)]
*  But I think this was different now, because 20 years later, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1770.38s)]
*  people remember what happened, at least enough do, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1773.66s)]
*  that they're able to make the counter case. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1776.98s)]
*  And I think that fortunately, we have a decision maker in chief [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1778.9s)]
*  who also remembers and listens to those arguments. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1782.5s)]
*  All right. I think we've made some good progress here. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1785.9s)]
*  Let's move on in the docket. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1788.14s)]
*  We've got a lot of other topics to talk about. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1789.78s)]
*  Obviously, oil prices, Chumak, you had talked about those in relation [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1793.0600000000002s)]
*  to this action. You said, hey, if this goes poorly, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1797.18s)]
*  we could be looking at a hundred dollar a barrel oil. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1799.5800000000002s)]
*  Quite interestingly, while it did spike a little bit up to seventy [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1802.1s)]
*  four dollars, almost hit your hundred dollars, Chumak, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1805.78s)]
*  racing up from the sixty dollar mark. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1808.78s)]
*  You know, we come back down now and I think people are energy [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1811.54s)]
*  independence here in the United States makes us not immune to this, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1814.3s)]
*  but we're somewhat protected. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1817.78s)]
*  And I think that's the great thing about energy independence. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1819.5s)]
*  But here we are. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1822.54s)]
*  The markets have digested this, priced it in, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1824.78s)]
*  processed it in a way that I think maybe [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1827.7s)]
*  none of us thought it would. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1830.38s)]
*  So maybe you could unpack your thinking now on the markets [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1831.9s)]
*  reaction to the war. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1835.3000000000002s)]
*  The fear that I had was that if there was a protracted conflict, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1837.3000000000002s)]
*  what you effectively would see. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1842.0200000000002s)]
*  Is a bunch of supply go offline? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1845.9s)]
*  And if that supply went offline and as long as the demand [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1849.6200000000001s)]
*  stayed even roughly the same, you would see prices go up. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1853.3000000000002s)]
*  My thought was that the price of oil [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1856.2600000000002s)]
*  could double. I think Goldman had it slightly under a doubling. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1858.6599999999999s)]
*  So that was definitely the the fear. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1862.7s)]
*  What folks had going into that weekend. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1866.46s)]
*  But coming out of it, this is where I think you have to be [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1869.5s)]
*  very respectful of the fact that the market is really the sum of [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1872.46s)]
*  many, many, many millions of informed opinions. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1876.06s)]
*  And I think what they saw was that. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1879.98s)]
*  Iran was not really in a position to do anything [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1883.1s)]
*  but capitulate and give up. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1886.18s)]
*  And I think that what they also saw, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1888.8200000000002s)]
*  whether you agree with the Israeli policy or not, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1892.5s)]
*  was that they had systematically gone from where they are [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1895.78s)]
*  and marched eastward. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1901.02s)]
*  Essentially, they effectively decapitated Hamas. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1902.74s)]
*  They effectively decapitated Hezbollah. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1907.1000000000001s)]
*  They effectively decapitated the Houthis. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1909.14s)]
*  I think that's the thing. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1912.74s)]
*  The Houthis. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1914.26s)]
*  I think finally putting a nail in the coffin of this [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1916.22s)]
*  Iran nuclear ambition program was not just important for them, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1919.62s)]
*  but it's critical for Saudi and the UAE. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1923.62s)]
*  Now, MBS had an incredibly powerful quote, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1926.34s)]
*  which was, if Iran gets a nuclear weapon, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1929.94s)]
*  we will have no choice but to get our own. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1932.34s)]
*  Right. So. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1934.74s)]
*  By taking all of that risk off the table, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1936.98s)]
*  what you're now talking about is an enormous supply [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1939.06s)]
*  that could essentially service world productivity needs unhindered [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1944.06s)]
*  because it's not just Iranian supply. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1948.54s)]
*  You're talking about Emirati supply [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1950.54s)]
*  and you're talking about Qatari supply [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1952.7s)]
*  and you're talking about Saudi supply. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1954.5s)]
*  So I think what the market realized was, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1956.1799999999998s)]
*  okay, now the Middle East is the closest it's ever been [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1958.46s)]
*  to fully monetizing the oil that they have [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1964.1399999999999s)]
*  and to invest aggressively into their own people. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1967.34s)]
*  The second thing is that Steve Witkoff spoke about the fact [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1972.46s)]
*  that you should expect the Abraham Accords to expand. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1977.9s)]
*  So if you think about that one, two punch, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1982.3s)]
*  not necessarily from a geopolitical lens, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1984.66s)]
*  but from an economic lens, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1986.74s)]
*  the first punch is neutering the Iranians' ability [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1988.3400000000001s)]
*  to be chaos monkeys in the region. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1991.98s)]
*  But the second punch is the one that then now creates [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1994.06s)]
*  normalization across the region with Israel. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=1997.18s)]
*  It double and triples down the ability to monetize oil [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2001.42s)]
*  and start to invest those returns in future projects [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2004.54s)]
*  that have a much better ROI. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2007.98s)]
*  All of that leads to cheaper energy. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2009.66s)]
*  And Iran becomes the odd person out here [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2011.7s)]
*  in this new federation of people in the Middle East [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2013.7s)]
*  who want peace and normal relations, I think. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2018.0600000000002s)]
*  It's a phenomenal question, Jason, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2020.66s)]
*  but I think that's what the market sniffed out. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2022.0600000000002s)]
*  And I think that's what the market is now saying, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2023.94s)]
*  that this is a chapter that we can close and move on. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2026.54s)]
*  This could be a big paradigm shift. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2032.22s)]
*  And Freiburg, the major part of this paradigm shift [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2033.66s)]
*  that we're seeing here comes from an investment in energy [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2036.14s)]
*  in the United States since the Iraq War, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2040.5s)]
*  since the Afghanistan War. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2042.66s)]
*  We now are energy independent. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2044.46s)]
*  We're a net exporter. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2046.06s)]
*  We've invested in solar. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2047.38s)]
*  We've invested in wind. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2048.7s)]
*  We are doing more drilling, net gas. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2049.98s)]
*  And this week, I think we saw some new starts [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2051.94s)]
*  for nuclear as well. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2054.7799999999997s)]
*  So this time around, when we look at our Middle East policy, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2057.4599999999996s)]
*  it is not informed by our need for that oil. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2061.4199999999996s)]
*  Is that correct, Freiburg, in your mind? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2063.62s)]
*  Well, I think you have to look at it on a global basis. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2065.62s)]
*  Iran exports $60 billion a year, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2068.4199999999996s)]
*  and about 55 billion of that goes to China. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2072.7s)]
*  And that number is up from, I believe, sub 30% [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2076.54s)]
*  just a few years ago, or sub 20%. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2080.2999999999997s)]
*  So the relationship between Iran and China [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2082.82s)]
*  and the importance of that relationship [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2087.26s)]
*  to China's economy and productivity, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2089.34s)]
*  I think, cannot be understated. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2092.1400000000003s)]
*  So independent of the United States, on a global stage, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2093.5800000000004s)]
*  the situation with the supply of energy [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2097.26s)]
*  and the partnership on energy [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2102.02s)]
*  with what is effectively the US's largest rival now [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2104.26s)]
*  is critical to take into account [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2108.2200000000003s)]
*  when doing the calculus on how to resolve forward here, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2110.06s)]
*  which is also why, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2112.7799999999997s)]
*  and I don't think that we have perfect information, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2113.94s)]
*  I don't think the public has been given perfect information [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2116.7s)]
*  about the statesmanship that's gone on [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2119.2599999999998s)]
*  between the United States and China, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2121.82s)]
*  or the conversations that gone on [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2123.2599999999998s)]
*  at a high level between the US and China, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2125.14s)]
*  or at a high level between the US and Russia [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2126.86s)]
*  regarding what is the right way to transition the region. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2130.02s)]
*  When I look at the region, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2135.2599999999998s)]
*  and when you hear about other leaders in that region [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2136.58s)]
*  speaking publicly, the King of Jordan, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2138.94s)]
*  MBS from Saudi, the Omanis from Bahrain, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2141.98s)]
*  all of the other leaders in that region, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2146.46s)]
*  even the Qataris who seem to kind of try [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2148.5s)]
*  to straddle both sides here, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2150.46s)]
*  they all seem to have a very strong imperative [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2152.54s)]
*  and incentive to modernize the Middle East, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2155.38s)]
*  to bring those economies into the global stage, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2158.54s)]
*  to bring them into kind of a modern economy. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2161.62s)]
*  And Jason, I know you've talked about this and you visited [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2163.86s)]
*  and the rest of us obviously have relationships there, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2165.86s)]
*  but there's a strong demand and a strong interest [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2168.26s)]
*  in this region in modernizing. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2170.3s)]
*  And that modernization is gonna benefit the world [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2172.0600000000004s)]
*  because they will ultimately be net exporters, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2174.86s)]
*  they will ultimately net producers of things [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2177.1800000000003s)]
*  that everyone else will buy and participate in, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2180.0600000000004s)]
*  and they will also be very big consumers. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2181.86s)]
*  They are already very big buyers of American technology [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2183.9s)]
*  and American businesses, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2187.9s)]
*  and also big financiers of global capitalism. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2189.1000000000004s)]
*  So in that context, I don't think it's just about, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2192.5s)]
*  hey, we gotta go get the oil, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2196.46s)]
*  or hey, we gotta go get the energy. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2198.18s)]
*  It's about how do you balance China's need for energy? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2199.9s)]
*  How do you balance the Russian incentives? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2203.58s)]
*  And how do you help the rest of that region modernize? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2205.7400000000002s)]
*  And I think that's where there's a very complex [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2208.42s)]
*  dance underway that we have very little insight [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2210.54s)]
*  into the details of those conversations. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2213.2200000000003s)]
*  And I'm not gonna just sit here and be like very flippant [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2214.94s)]
*  about, oh, we should do this or we should do that, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2216.86s)]
*  because there's a lot at play. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2219.14s)]
*  And I think that that is, in my opinion, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2220.82s)]
*  the net calculus, the bigger picture calculus [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2223.5s)]
*  that's underway in trying to transition the region. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2226.02s)]
*  Sacks, let me ask you a question here, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2229.2599999999998s)]
*  leveling it up, pretty well known. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2230.98s)]
*  The Israelis have nuclear weapons, and many of them, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2233.22s)]
*  and they have for some time, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2236.74s)]
*  even though they're not part of any of the treaties, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2238.14s)]
*  and they will claim they don't, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2240.22s)]
*  or be a little coy about it. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2242.06s)]
*  What is the argument for nobody else in the region [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2244.54s)]
*  being allowed to have one if the Israelis have many? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2247.06s)]
*  And would you be okay with Saudi having nuclear bombs [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2250.22s)]
*  and what is the argument we would make to them [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2255.54s)]
*  as the West, Americans, people who have nuclear weapons? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2258.7799999999997s)]
*  Russia, China have them, why can't Saudi have them? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2263.2599999999998s)]
*  What's your best argument to them of not acquiring them [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2265.62s)]
*  if the Israelis have dozens to hundreds? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2268.3399999999997s)]
*  Well, nuclear proliferation is not in our interest. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2270.8599999999997s)]
*  We don't want more countries getting nuclear weapons. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2273.62s)]
*  Obviously, some countries have them, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2275.8999999999996s)]
*  but if you use that as the rationalization [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2278.3399999999997s)]
*  for everyone being able to have them, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2280.2599999999998s)]
*  then you're gonna end up with 200 countries [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2281.62s)]
*  that have nuclear weapons. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2283.02s)]
*  So I think the nuclear nonproliferation regime [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2283.86s)]
*  is in the interest of the United States. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2286.54s)]
*  We all understand the danger of these weapons. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2288.7000000000003s)]
*  The more countries that have them, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2290.58s)]
*  the more dangerous the world becomes. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2291.6600000000003s)]
*  Now, it is true that unofficially [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2294.2200000000003s)]
*  the Israelis have nuclear weapons, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2297.58s)]
*  but like you were saying before, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2299.1400000000003s)]
*  if Iran gets nukes, then Saudi Arabia [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2300.58s)]
*  will be forced to get nukes, and so on down the line. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2303.5s)]
*  And so there will be a domino effect. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2305.6800000000003s)]
*  With each country that gets nuclear weapons, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2307.88s)]
*  more countries around them will feel the need [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2310.28s)]
*  that are threatened to have their own deterrent. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2313.42s)]
*  And the question is just where you stop this. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2316.06s)]
*  And I think we just wanna stop it here. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2318.5s)]
*  We don't want more countries getting nuclear weapons, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2320.6800000000003s)]
*  particularly ones that we have hostile relations with. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2323.54s)]
*  Yeah, and the last country [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2325.9s)]
*  to give up their nuclear weapons, Ukraine. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2328.86s)]
*  Really bad decision, perhaps, I think, in hindsight. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2331.34s)]
*  Well, that was in the 90s. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2334.62s)]
*  Actually, another country gave up [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2335.58s)]
*  their nuclear weapons program, which was Libya. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2337.98s)]
*  And what happened to Gaddafi, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2340.82s)]
*  he got killed by rebels who were being backed [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2342.86s)]
*  by the United States after he gave up [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2346.46s)]
*  his nuclear weapons program. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2348.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2349.94s)]
*  I think that was a really bad sense of- [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2350.78s)]
*  Well, Ukraine had them, though. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2351.6200000000003s)]
*  They actually had the weapons, not just a program, right? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2352.54s)]
*  But there's no distinction there. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2354.7400000000002s)]
*  There's some truth to that, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2356.54s)]
*  but that's a little bit simplifying the situation, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2357.46s)]
*  because what happened is at the end of the Soviet Union, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2359.7000000000003s)]
*  there were a bunch of Soviet nukes that were in Ukraine. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2362.1800000000003s)]
*  But as I understand it, the launch codes were in Moscow. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2365.3s)]
*  So these were Soviet nuclear weapons [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2369.2000000000003s)]
*  that happened to be on Ukrainian soil. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2371.82s)]
*  And then when the Soviet Union came apart, they were there. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2374.1400000000003s)]
*  But they were always under the control of Moscow. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2376.6600000000003s)]
*  And so I don't think that the Ukrainians gave up much, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2379.6600000000003s)]
*  because they were never their nukes. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2384.78s)]
*  It's not clear they could have used them. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2386.5800000000004s)]
*  And one final point on this is that it was [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2388.38s)]
*  the Russian government and the American government [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2391.6600000000003s)]
*  that pressured Ukraine to comply, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2393.6200000000003s)]
*  because we don't want more countries [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2396.0600000000004s)]
*  having nuclear weapons. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2397.6200000000003s)]
*  Okay, let's get onto this democratic socialist [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2398.5s)]
*  who's on the verge of becoming New York City's mayor. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2401.78s)]
*  Little known New York state assemblyman, Zoran Mamdani, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2405.98s)]
*  took the internet by storm this week, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2409.8s)]
*  shocked the world, beating out Andrew Cuomo [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2411.06s)]
*  for the democratic nomination. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2413.78s)]
*  Here's the polymarket chart, just crazy. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2415.42s)]
*  One month ago, Cuomo was at 93%. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2417.58s)]
*  Zoran had a 6% chance. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2420.98s)]
*  My Lord, what a flip. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2424.18s)]
*  A couple of things happened that led to this, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2427.2000000000003s)]
*  obviously a bunch of viral moments. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2428.96s)]
*  He's a great speaker, reminds me of Vic in that regard, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2430.8s)]
*  really good in debates and speaking publicly. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2434.1600000000003s)]
*  Started rising in the polls, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2438.4s)]
*  got a ton of endorsements from millennials, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2439.7200000000003s)]
*  Gen Z, AOC endorsed him as well. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2442.96s)]
*  And now he is, Mamdani is the 75% favorite [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2446.1400000000003s)]
*  to beat Eric Adams. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2451.1200000000003s)]
*  But looks like Eric Adams is gonna get [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2452.52s)]
*  a shocking amount of support [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2454.6000000000004s)]
*  because people don't want a democratic socialist [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2456.8s)]
*  who's got some really unique and colorful history [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2460.2s)]
*  of becoming the mayor of one of the greatest cities [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2465.96s)]
*  in the world, my hometown. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2469.36s)]
*  He wants to have free buses. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2470.7599999999998s)]
*  It doesn't sound like that big of a deal. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2473.2s)]
*  He wants to freeze rent and triple [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2475.0s)]
*  the development of affordable housing. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2476.88s)]
*  City-owned government grocery stores, that sounds crazy. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2477.96s)]
*  A $30 minimum wage, New York's at 16.50, by the way. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2481.6s)]
*  He wants to defund the police, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2485.36s)]
*  replace the cops with social workers in high crime areas, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2486.7200000000003s)]
*  a bunch of really wacky, interesting proposals. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2489.44s)]
*  And you were, I think, onto this early, Friedberg, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2492.96s)]
*  in your predictions last year, you saw this coming. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2498.52s)]
*  Again, if you listen to the number one podcast [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2501.44s)]
*  in the world, you're gonna get this information [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2503.52s)]
*  a year earlier than everybody else. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2504.92s)]
*  That's why we are the number one podcast [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2507.6400000000003s)]
*  in the world, Friedberg. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2509.0s)]
*  Maybe you talk a little bit about your prediction last year [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2509.84s)]
*  and where we are right now and your reaction for this, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2513.76s)]
*  I don't know, perplexing, shocking. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2518.44s)]
*  Is this perplexing, shocking, or obvious to you? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2519.84s)]
*  For me, it feels like, actually, a little bit [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2522.7200000000003s)]
*  of a beginning of a wave that's gonna continue [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2524.84s)]
*  to sweep over this country, starting in cities. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2528.54s)]
*  And I think that we're at the very early stages. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2531.2400000000002s)]
*  I think we'll look back, and I jokingly say [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2533.88s)]
*  that Kamala Harris is gonna look [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2537.4s)]
*  like a conservative candidate pretty soon. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2538.84s)]
*  And I do think that this is a broad kind of reaction [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2541.96s)]
*  to the economic condition of the United States. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2545.7599999999998s)]
*  And I've talked, a lot of people don't quite recognize [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2547.96s)]
*  and see how important the debt and the deficit is [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2550.52s)]
*  with respect to how it's ultimately going to lead [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2553.74s)]
*  to socialism as it has every single time in history [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2555.8s)]
*  when you've had a free voting democracy, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2558.88s)]
*  a representative democracy that becomes encumbered [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2560.96s)]
*  with too much debt. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2563.94s)]
*  So Nick, if you'll pull up this chart, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2565.16s)]
*  I'll just show you a microcosm of it [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2566.64s)]
*  and specifically how it played out in New York [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2568.36s)]
*  and how it will continue to play out in cities. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2570.32s)]
*  This is the total amount of student loan debt. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2572.36s)]
*  In the last 20 years, the student loan debt has ballooned [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2574.38s)]
*  from 500 billion to 2 trillion. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2576.7200000000003s)]
*  4 million college graduates per year in the United States, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2579.6000000000004s)]
*  about 40% of them have student loan debt that they leave. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2582.46s)]
*  That means that in the last 20 years, 80 million people, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2585.7200000000003s)]
*  young people have graduated from college [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2588.84s)]
*  and they've accrued $1.5 trillion of new debt. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2591.1200000000003s)]
*  And based on the percentage and the distribution, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2594.36s)]
*  that means the average debt for these individuals [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2596.1600000000003s)]
*  is sitting around $60,000. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2598.16s)]
*  So you're a young person. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2600.6s)]
*  Where do those young people go? [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2601.8799999999997s)]
*  Where do they live? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2603.02s)]
*  And remember, there's about 32 million of them. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2604.1s)]
*  They live in cities. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2606.94s)]
*  They don't go back to rural towns. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2608.64s)]
*  Most of that population sits in cities. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2610.58s)]
*  It sits in New York, sits in Los Angeles, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2612.74s)]
*  sits in Seattle, sits in San Francisco, sits in Portland, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2615.7599999999998s)]
*  and sits in Chicago. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2620.46s)]
*  And what we're seeing in those cities [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2622.3599999999997s)]
*  is a massive political shift. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2624.16s)]
*  People call it left, but it's actually quite different [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2626.42s)]
*  than just being more traditionally left. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2628.86s)]
*  It's really a revolution against the system [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2630.64s)]
*  that brought them to this moment. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2632.54s)]
*  Because the promise that we gave in America, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2634.2200000000003s)]
*  the American dream was if you will go to college, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2636.34s)]
*  you will graduate, you will have income, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2638.34s)]
*  you will have stability, you will be able to buy a home. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2640.34s)]
*  And what we did is we increased the government's role [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2643.1s)]
*  in making that dream possible. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2646.06s)]
*  And in doing so, we created effectively a system [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2648.1s)]
*  where we gave unrestricted access to capital, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2651.5s)]
*  which inflated the cost of education. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2654.62s)]
*  People could go to school like Zoran [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2656.9s)]
*  and major in African studies at Bowdoin College. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2658.9s)]
*  They could get a loan and graduate [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2662.14s)]
*  with $200,000, $300,000 of debt, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2664.2599999999998s)]
*  and then never get a job. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2666.54s)]
*  The guy has not had a real job. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2667.62s)]
*  And this is the truth for 32 million young Americans. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2669.0s)]
*  They find themselves living in places [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2672.8599999999997s)]
*  where they cannot afford to pay their bills every month, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2674.9s)]
*  and they will never get out of the debt cycle [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2677.2999999999997s)]
*  that they were thrust into [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2679.4s)]
*  and believe that they were going to be able to graduate from [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2681.0s)]
*  and excel in the world and increase. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2684.34s)]
*  They all have what is called negative capital. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2686.54s)]
*  They have debt and they will never be able [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2689.6200000000003s)]
*  to get out of that cycle. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2691.1000000000004s)]
*  So where do you turn in that moment? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2691.98s)]
*  You don't go turn to corporations to solve your problems. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2694.02s)]
*  You don't go turn to your friends [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2696.46s)]
*  and your siblings and your family. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2698.1600000000003s)]
*  They're not gonna bail you out. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2699.56s)]
*  You turn to the voting booth [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2701.6600000000003s)]
*  and you hear a guy like Zoran show up [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2704.26s)]
*  and say there can be a better path forward. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2706.28s)]
*  The better path forward is the government can [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2708.84s)]
*  and should do more to help. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2710.98s)]
*  And in doing more to help, we will increase government. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2713.48s)]
*  We will tax the rich. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2715.8799999999997s)]
*  We will tax the corporations. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2716.8599999999997s)]
*  We will take all of that capital [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2718.48s)]
*  and we will redistribute it in the form of services [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2720.22s)]
*  and checks and support for all of the people [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2723.72s)]
*  that find themselves unable to take care of themselves. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2726.48s)]
*  And this becomes a tipping point [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2729.64s)]
*  when the majority of the voter base ends up [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2731.2799999999997s)]
*  in that situation where they're that deeply in need, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2733.8599999999997s)]
*  where they have negative capital. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2736.08s)]
*  And that is the situation America finds itself in today. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2737.58s)]
*  There is no easy answer [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2740.4s)]
*  and there is no easy solution out of this, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2741.76s)]
*  but I can tell you one thing for sure [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2743.32s)]
*  that in historical perspective, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2745.1800000000003s)]
*  we have seen it time and time again [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2747.1800000000003s)]
*  across dozens of countries that have embraced socialism [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2749.46s)]
*  to get out of the debt cycle that ultimately absorbs [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2752.46s)]
*  and swallows up the young. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2755.2400000000002s)]
*  It swallows up every family. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2757.92s)]
*  It swallows up every person in the working class with debt. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2759.2400000000002s)]
*  They're swaddled with it. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2762.1600000000003s)]
*  And they all try and get out of it [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2763.36s)]
*  by increasing government [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2764.7200000000003s)]
*  and embracing these socialist concepts. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2766.14s)]
*  And it has never, ever worked. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2768.08s)]
*  More government is not the answer. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2769.88s)]
*  Less government is, we can get into that. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2771.6400000000003s)]
*  But if you look at the results, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2773.56s)]
*  Zoran won 61 to 39 with college educated. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2774.92s)]
*  Young people voted for him. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2779.2400000000002s)]
*  Old people did not as much. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2780.52s)]
*  White people voted for him because they went to college. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2782.36s)]
*  Non-white people did not as much. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2784.88s)]
*  At the end of the day, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2787.34s)]
*  young college educated white people elected this guy. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2788.28s)]
*  And that is the beginning of a wave [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2791.92s)]
*  that will sweep over America. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2793.46s)]
*  And I really do worry about where this takes us. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2795.36s)]
*  Way to go, dummies. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2797.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you're correct. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2800.48s)]
*  He won amongst Asians, whites, college educated. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2803.3599999999997s)]
*  And to put a finer point on it, Freiburg, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2806.3599999999997s)]
*  it really isn't just college. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2809.22s)]
*  It's the cost of college. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2810.52s)]
*  Increases in the cost of college degrees [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2812.04s)]
*  have outpaced the wage growth of entry level salaries [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2814.16s)]
*  by 10X over the last 20 years. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2817.96s)]
*  You could go 300,000, 400,000, not in debt, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2821.1s)]
*  but that might be what you paid for those degrees [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2824.12s)]
*  in those major cities. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2827.6800000000003s)]
*  And you don't believe in capitalism anymore. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2828.52s)]
*  And you believe that you need to tax the rich. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2830.96s)]
*  Just one warning for people in these states, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2833.64s)]
*  in these cities, we saw this, Sax, in San Francisco. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2837.14s)]
*  We saw the doom spiral. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2840.44s)]
*  You and I worked on the Chesapeake recall. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2842.48s)]
*  And now they have Dan Laurie there. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2845.52s)]
*  And things are starting to slowly turn around a bit. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2846.92s)]
*  In Los Angeles, we saw this with Karen Bass. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2850.4s)]
*  They didn't vote for Rick Caruso. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2852.88s)]
*  He would have been an amazing mayor. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2854.1800000000003s)]
*  They voted for incompetence. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2855.9s)]
*  And these people are voting for incompetence [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2857.26s)]
*  and a plan that will not work [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2860.38s)]
*  because two thirds of the tax base in New York [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2862.5s)]
*  is paid for by the top 10% who are leaving. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2864.86s)]
*  People will leave. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2867.98s)]
*  They will see that Austin and Miami [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2869.36s)]
*  are fantastic cities to live in at half the price, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2871.7000000000003s)]
*  a third of the price, and you get a tax break. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2874.78s)]
*  And you can always go back to New York and California [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2877.58s)]
*  and hang out for a month [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2879.62s)]
*  and get whatever values left in those cities [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2880.46s)]
*  that hasn't been destroyed by these socialists [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2883.34s)]
*  and the incompetent people running them. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2886.1000000000004s)]
*  Sax, what are your thoughts on what's happening [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2888.6000000000004s)]
*  in New York City specifically? [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2890.6600000000003s)]
*  Well, you're right that every generation [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2893.1400000000003s)]
*  seems to need to learn this lesson for themselves [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2894.92s)]
*  because they don't study history [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2898.1000000000004s)]
*  and they don't see that socialism always fails [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2899.52s)]
*  wherever it's tried. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2902.2000000000003s)]
*  San Francisco went through this. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2903.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, it was a doom spiral. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2905.1000000000004s)]
*  Now I think we've turned the corner. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2907.38s)]
*  LA is in the midst of going through it. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2909.1400000000003s)]
*  And a large portion of LA just burned down [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2911.06s)]
*  because there's no water in the fire hydrants. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2914.1400000000003s)]
*  Basically all the public services have been looted. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2915.5800000000004s)]
*  And New York is about to learn this for themselves. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2918.5800000000004s)]
*  So it just seems like every generation [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2920.6200000000003s)]
*  just has to learn this. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2922.42s)]
*  There's no way to teach them. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2923.26s)]
*  So I do think that that is one thing that's going on. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2924.78s)]
*  I do agree with Freeburg that a big underlying root cause [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2927.26s)]
*  here is the student debt. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2930.46s)]
*  It's the fact that these kids have negative capital. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2931.86s)]
*  They've got no skin in the game. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2934.7000000000003s)]
*  They graduated from college with worthless degrees [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2936.1400000000003s)]
*  and massive amounts of debt. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2939.0600000000004s)]
*  That debt was not used to make their education better. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2940.28s)]
*  Universities have been using the spiraling tuitions [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2944.0800000000004s)]
*  to fund massive amounts of bureaucracy [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2947.82s)]
*  for DEI and woke and all sorts of stuff like that. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2950.2000000000003s)]
*  And these kids have no prospect of getting out of debt [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2953.1600000000003s)]
*  or being able to buy a home. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2956.7200000000003s)]
*  So they just have no skin in the game. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2958.3s)]
*  And so this is part of why [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2959.94s)]
*  they're turning against capitalism. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2961.0400000000004s)]
*  One thing we need to do, by the way, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2962.96s)]
*  is we need to make the student debt [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2965.1400000000003s)]
*  dischargeable in bankruptcy. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2967.48s)]

*  through bankruptcy. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2973.46s)]
*  And if we were to make that change, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2974.96s)]
*  at least these kids would have a way out. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2976.32s)]
*  They have no skin in the game. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2977.94s)]
*  The universities have absolutely no incentive [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2979.2200000000003s)]
*  to keep prices down and create a competitive [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2981.94s)]

*  The only group that possibly could [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2987.54s)]
*  would be true capital lenders. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2989.7000000000003s)]

*  here's a loan because I expect you to be able to pay it back. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2993.7400000000002s)]
*  There's no underwriting in student loans today. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2996.0s)]
*  There's no underwriting. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=2998.6600000000003s)]
*  The federal student loan program needs to go away [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3000.7400000000002s)]

*  and people might say, oh, that's awful. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3005.26s)]
*  You're taking away education. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3006.5800000000004s)]
*  What will happen is the capital markets [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3007.96s)]
*  will flood to fill that hole. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3009.82s)]
*  Banks and lenders will show up [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3011.42s)]
*  and they will say, you know what? [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3013.6200000000003s)]
*  We'll underwrite the loans, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3014.6600000000003s)]
*  but they'll underwrite it by saying, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3016.0800000000004s)]

*  will now get loans. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3025.0600000000004s)]
*  And all of the rest of the money [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3026.3s)]
*  that's caused everyone to end up in this debt spiral [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3027.5s)]
*  will stop and we'll be able to kind of recover from it. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3029.94s)]
*  It's ironic that a problem that is being caused by government [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3032.66s)]
*  is gonna lead to socialism. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3037.58s)]
*  It's gonna lead to maximum government, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3039.54s)]
*  which will then create the next spiral of problems. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3041.34s)]
*  But I agree with you. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3043.56s)]
*  I think this is very sad. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3044.52s)]
*  But let me also say, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3045.86s)]
*  I think there's one other thing going on here, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3047.08s)]
*  which is beyond just sort of the lack of skin [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3048.86s)]
*  of the game here, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3051.7s)]
*  which is the failure of the democratic establishment. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3052.9s)]
*  It's basically completely antiquated, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3055.94s)]
*  desiccated and out of touch. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3059.34s)]
*  And who was ma'am Donnie running against? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3061.1s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo, who is really a perfect avatar [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3064.7000000000003s)]
*  for this establishment. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3068.14s)]
*  He's a retread. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3069.7400000000002s)]
*  He's been around for decades. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3070.98s)]
*  He'd probably be finishing his fourth term as governor, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3072.68s)]
*  except for a harassment scandal that forces resignation. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3075.02s)]
*  He's 67, which is something of a spring chicken [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3079.26s)]
*  by the standards of Democrat gerontocracy, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3081.5s)]
*  but he's twice the age of Miami, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3084.2000000000003s)]
*  who's 33. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3086.78s)]
*  And Cuomo hasn't even lived in New York City [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3087.6200000000003s)]
*  for three decades. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3089.2200000000003s)]
*  He wanted to mount a political comeback [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3090.26s)]
*  that no one was asking for. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3092.1400000000003s)]
*  And the democratic establishment just fell in line [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3093.94s)]
*  rather than having a proper contest [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3096.1600000000003s)]
*  to choose a less damaged, more dynamic candidate. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3098.34s)]
*  And- [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3101.5s)]
*  He's a nepo baby too. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3102.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3103.46s)]
*  So, you know, does this sound familiar? [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3104.3s)]
*  I mean, this is exactly what happened with Biden [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3105.48s)]
*  is that no one wanted him to run again. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3107.58s)]
*  He was obviously a very weak candidate, [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3111.02s)]
*  but the democratic establishment just fell in line [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3115.34s)]
*  and covered up his weaknesses, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3117.5s)]
*  and they used lawfare to take out his opponents- [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3119.02s)]
*  Totally. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3121.1800000000003s)]
*  Rather than trying to find a more dynamic candidate. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3122.02s)]
*  And by the way, one of the reasons why ma'am Dami [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3123.7000000000003s)]
*  is set to become mayor is because [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3127.02s)]
*  the democratic establishment used lawfare [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3130.1800000000003s)]
*  against Eric Adams to basically weaken him [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3132.5s)]
*  and take him out over some plane tickets. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3135.76s)]
*  I thought this was a very weak corruption scandal. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3138.3s)]
*  There were upgrades. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3139.94s)]
*  There were upgrades even. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3140.78s)]
*  Like it was so insane. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3142.02s)]
*  It's a pretty crazy- [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3143.82s)]
*  By political scandals. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3146.1s)]
*  This is a really lame one. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3147.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3148.72s)]
*  And it was done because Eric Adams stepped out of line [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3149.56s)]
*  and was willing to criticize unions and buck unions. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3152.06s)]
*  And he was for the police. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3154.8199999999997s)]
*  He was basically a Democrat who was willing [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3156.58s)]
*  to take contrarian positions on a lot of things. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3159.62s)]
*  And they took him out with lawfare. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3161.9s)]
*  And that is now they got something much worse. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3163.3399999999997s)]
*  Did you see Chuck Schumer and Bill Clinton [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3165.22s)]
*  put out ringing endorsements and congratulations [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3167.14s)]
*  to ma'am Dami this morning? [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3169.66s)]
*  Which, you know, I think the Overton window [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3171.1s)]
*  is blown open on this now. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3173.14s)]
*  I do think that the Democrats here, point sacks, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3174.26s)]
*  are embracing the socialist agenda as the new agenda [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3176.94s)]
*  that is clearly gonna win the youthful vote for them. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3180.86s)]
*  At a negative 70 rating, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3183.26s)]
*  they finally woken up to the fact [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3185.1400000000003s)]
*  that they can't have no agenda. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3186.6200000000003s)]
*  They can't have nothing that they stand for, [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3188.78s)]
*  which is effectively my read on what's been the case [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3191.0800000000004s)]
*  for the last year and a half, two years, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3193.38s)]
*  for the Democratic Party. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3194.6600000000003s)]
*  They now have something to stand for, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3195.94s)]
*  which is these principles of socialism, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3197.7400000000002s)]
*  which they call justice and equity and fairness [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3199.46s)]
*  and redistribution of capital [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3201.86s)]
*  and all these other features that were kind of rung out [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3203.34s)]
*  at the Mom Donnie campaign and everyone embraced and ran to. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3205.7000000000003s)]
*  The Democratic leadership perked up [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3208.44s)]
*  like a bunch of prairie dogs popping out of the ground, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3210.2200000000003s)]
*  like, whoa, this is now gonna be the way we're gonna win? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3212.26s)]
*  Great, we're all over it, let's do it. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3215.06s)]
*  They're accepting the inevitable. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3217.08s)]
*  Look, the Democratic Party right now, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3218.46s)]
*  the Democratic establishment is in the process [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3220.98s)]
*  of being remade now, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3223.44s)]
*  the way that the Republican establishment [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3225.54s)]
*  was remade a decade ago. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3227.54s)]
*  So remember, a decade ago, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3229.5s)]
*  the Republican Party was dominated [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3230.82s)]
*  by people like Dole and McCain and Romney [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3232.42s)]
*  and various Bush retreads, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3236.58s)]
*  and it was antiquated and out of touch, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3238.6800000000003s)]
*  and Trump came in there and remade it [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3241.14s)]
*  as a nationalist, populist Republican Party. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3243.44s)]
*  And I think in a similar way, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3247.12s)]
*  you now have these socialists who've come in [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3248.28s)]
*  in the Democratic Party, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3250.3s)]
*  and they are remaking the Democratic Party [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3251.26s)]
*  in the same way that Trump replaced neoconservatism [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3253.64s)]
*  with populist nationalism, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3256.66s)]
*  they are replacing neoliberalism [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3257.92s)]
*  with, you could call it populist socialism. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3260.7400000000002s)]
*  And those are the choices for the future, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3263.2200000000003s)]
*  let me tell you, you can basically go with, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3265.1800000000003s)]
*  you're gonna have a populist socialism [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3267.6600000000003s)]
*  in the Democratic Party, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3269.6600000000003s)]
*  or you're gonna have a populist nationalism [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3270.5s)]

*  And to all my friends on the tech right, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3273.7000000000003s)]
*  your choices in the future are not gonna be neoliberalism [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3275.9s)]
*  or neoconservatism, it's gonna be, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3278.2200000000003s)]
*  do you want Republican nationalism, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3279.88s)]
*  or do you want Democrat socialism? [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3281.56s)]
*  Those are gonna be your choices. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3283.44s)]
*  So I would get with the program here [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3285.3s)]
*  because your choices are MAGA or socialism, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3287.08s)]
*  which one do you want? [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3290.98s)]
*  There is a third way, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3291.8199999999997s)]
*  but Chamath, what are your thoughts here in terms of- [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3292.64s)]
*  I don't know if there is. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3294.5s)]
*  Since we're here, there is actually a path out of here, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3295.58s)]
*  which is telling the truth, young people, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3298.3799999999997s)]
*  your college degree is not going to get you [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3300.8799999999997s)]
*  an amazingly high paying job. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3303.66s)]
*  What will get you an amazingly high paying job [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3305.3799999999997s)]
*  is excellence, learning skills, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3307.8599999999997s)]
*  and having radical self-reliance. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3311.22s)]
*  Being reliant on the state, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3313.2999999999997s)]
*  being reliant on the government is a path to nowhere, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3314.8599999999997s)]
*  it's a path to pain and suffering, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3317.66s)]
*  to constantly be looking for this guy [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3320.7400000000002s)]
*  to create a bread line in his own series of Costco's, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3322.54s)]
*  which is the stupidest thing I've ever heard, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3325.9s)]
*  that he thinks that you're gonna be able to create, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3327.98s)]
*  in New York City, a series of government-run stores. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3330.54s)]
*  Does anybody have any sense to the arc of history [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3334.62s)]
*  that he wants to create bread lines [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3338.06s)]
*  and literally have the state provide you with food [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3339.82s)]
*  at this promised discount? [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3343.2200000000003s)]
*  It's absurd. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3344.7400000000002s)]
*  Leave the state, vote with your feet, go to Austin, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3346.16s)]
*  go to Miami, go to another state [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3350.54s)]
*  where radical self-reliance and your ability [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3352.18s)]
*  to create your own opportunities [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3354.8199999999997s)]
*  and not get suckered into this debt spiral, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3356.5s)]
*  that is the path out and that will be a new party [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3359.2799999999997s)]
*  that will emerge at some point. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3361.7599999999998s)]
*  Some rational group of people are gonna say, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3363.54s)]
*  get skills, don't get debt. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3365.5s)]
*  Chamath, what are your thoughts on all this? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3367.4799999999996s)]
*  And then we'll move on to the next subject. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3368.9399999999996s)]
*  I think the three of you guys are a little exaggerated, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3370.58s)]
*  to be quite honest. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3372.8199999999997s)]
*  I mean, all the rhetoric sounds very clever, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3373.66s)]
*  but I don't think it's accurate. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3375.4199999999996s)]
*  I think the way that I see it is more nuanced than this. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3376.62s)]
*  I think what's happened is that Zoran Mamdani [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3380.74s)]
*  is very smart and is running a playbook to win, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3386.14s)]
*  like all politicians do, based on a formula [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3390.14s)]
*  that has been winning in large cities for the past decade. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3393.3399999999997s)]
*  And so I don't know if he really believes [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3400.06s)]
*  in this rhetoric or not, but it's worth noting [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3402.38s)]
*  that most of his platform is copied and pasted [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3405.14s)]
*  from London and Chicago. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3408.42s)]
*  So the things that he's talked about, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3410.9s)]
*  universal basic free meals, affordable housing, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3412.2999999999997s)]
*  freezing the cost of transportation, public grocery stores, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3415.14s)]
*  all three of you are reacting like these things [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3418.74s)]
*  were pulled out of thin air, they're not. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3420.92s)]
*  These were the public platforms of the mayors [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3423.18s)]
*  who have won in London, in Vienna, in Havana, Cuba, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3425.66s)]
*  and in Chicago. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3431.94s)]
*  So I think the reason why this works [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3433.7s)]
*  is that these are small pockets in the end [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3436.58s)]
*  of a large political spectrum. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3439.22s)]
*  Even though New York feels big, it isn't that big [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3440.7799999999997s)]
*  in the context of the United States. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3444.02s)]
*  And what you see is that when you try to take [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3446.2999999999997s)]
*  those policies in a city, take London, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3449.06s)]
*  and then level it up at the national level, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3453.22s)]
*  there's a quick schism that happens. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3456.74s)]
*  So if you look at labor and labor trying to scale up [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3458.7s)]
*  the policies of a Sadiq Khan in London [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3461.94s)]
*  throughout the country, labor is now at the absolute, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3464.3s)]
*  the labor party, the absolute lowest approval ratings [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3468.78s)]
*  in the UK of any party ever in this moment in time [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3472.18s)]
*  after an election. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3476.9s)]
*  So I think what you're probably seeing [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3477.98s)]
*  is quite a sophisticated A-B test. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3481.46s)]
*  And I think that the political wing men [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3484.86s)]
*  and the money people that want to be in control [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3487.1s)]
*  know how to run candidates on platforms that can win. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3491.14s)]
*  And this is a clear winning strategy [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3495.3399999999997s)]
*  in left-leaning major metropolitan centers. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3497.46s)]
*  So what I would say, just to refine what you guys are saying, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3500.9s)]
*  is that this platform is not new. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3505.04s)]
*  I've seen it for the last decade. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3508.2799999999997s)]
*  I think you're gonna see it for the next few decades. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3510.2599999999998s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3513.66s)]
*  And so you're gonna see the same results in New York City [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3515.8199999999997s)]
*  that you've already seen in London, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3519.18s)]
*  which has become unlivable, sadly, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3521.94s)]
*  one of my favorite cities in the world. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3523.98s)]
*  If you don't believe it, go visit there. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3525.3999999999996s)]
*  Chicago, which I haven't been to in 15 years [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3528.94s)]
*  and I never go to, it's a disaster. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3531.94s)]
*  So my point is it just doesn't work. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3534.74s)]
*  So you can win. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3536.58s)]
*  It actually isn't very effective [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3539.06s)]
*  and it doesn't scale to the national level. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3541.2s)]
*  So I think- [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3543.5s)]
*  When do you think it returns, Tamat? [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3544.3399999999997s)]
*  Like, what's the reversal? [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3545.16s)]
*  Like, do you think the reversal is [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3546.3399999999997s)]
*  everyone has some experience with crime? [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3548.14s)]
*  Is the reversal, like the city's bankrupt? [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3551.98s)]
*  Is the reversal- [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3555.2799999999997s)]
*  Your house is burned down. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3556.12s)]
*  You're unemployed, unemployment hits a certain level. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3557.62s)]
*  No firefighters with water in the pipes? [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3559.54s)]
*  I'll tell you something, which is my view. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3562.1s)]
*  My view is much more basic. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3564.3399999999997s)]
*  It's much less sophisticated than I think what you're saying. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3566.22s)]
*  My extremely simpleton view of things is that [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3569.7s)]
*  humans swing in a pendulum-like fashion between poles. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3573.22s)]
*  And over multi-decade arcs, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3578.2999999999997s)]
*  you go between the thing that works [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3581.18s)]
*  to the thing that should work now [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3583.02s)]
*  because it's not the thing before. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3584.7s)]
*  So I suspect what happens is that New York [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3586.8599999999997s)]
*  takes a 40 or 50 year journey. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3589.14s)]
*  And at some point, it will look like New York of the 80s. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3591.4s)]
*  And at that point, you'll have an Ed Cook-like figure. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3595.7799999999997s)]
*  You'll have a David Dinkins-like figure. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3599.06s)]
*  You'll have a Michael Bloomberg-like figure. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3601.1s)]
*  You'll have the broken windows theory of policing [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3603.2599999999998s)]
*  reemerge as the cause celebra. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3605.46s)]
*  And the cycle will repeat itself. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3609.66s)]
*  So I tend to think that these things are just [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3611.44s)]
*  between two poles. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3615.02s)]
*  We've spent a lot of time [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3616.1s)]
*  in this more independent self-reliance pole. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3617.82s)]
*  A lot of people will want to experiment [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3621.9s)]
*  with this other thing. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3623.44s)]
*  It just doesn't prove to work. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3625.02s)]
*  And in the absence of something cataclysmically bad, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3626.92s)]
*  I don't think it's gonna change. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3629.78s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3630.9s)]
*  I can experience Dinkins and Koch to Dinkins [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3631.7799999999997s)]
*  and then Giuliani to Bloomberg. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3635.8599999999997s)]
*  I can tell you it's gonna be really miserable [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3637.72s)]

*  If you got off the wrong subway stop, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3645.3399999999997s)]
*  it was going to result in you getting robbed. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3647.4599999999996s)]
*  At gunpoint. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3650.4599999999996s)]

*  That's London today. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3652.9799999999996s)]
*  The London subway cost $35 to go from the suburbs of London [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3654.4599999999996s)]
*  into the center of London. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3658.7s)]
*  $35, okay? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3659.9s)]
*  That is ridiculous, right? [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3661.9s)]
*  You can't walk with your cell phone [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3664.46s)]
*  in central London anymore [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3666.2200000000003s)]
*  because there are more cell phone thefts than anything. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3667.42s)]
*  There's knife attacks everywhere. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3669.7400000000002s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3672.38s)]
*  Well, you've had an agenda [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3674.94s)]
*  that was meant to be this socialist left-leaning, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3676.3s)]
*  let's resolve all these problems for everybody. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3679.02s)]
*  And it turns out did not work at a very basic factual level. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3680.94s)]
*  And every time it's been repeated over the last 15 years, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3684.48s)]
*  it still hasn't worked. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3687.26s)]
*  So if you think that this guy is gonna be the exception [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3688.76s)]
*  that proves the rule in New York, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3691.78s)]
*  I wish him the best of luck. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3693.28s)]
*  But I would be short New York real estate. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3694.96s)]
*  I think it's going to crash and burn. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3697.5600000000004s)]
*  And then we'll pick up the pieces and we'll reset. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3699.6000000000004s)]
*  All right, let me pick up on something [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3702.28s)]
*  that Jamal said about ma'am Don, what's his name? [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3703.7200000000003s)]
*  Zoran. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3706.6800000000003s)]
*  Zoran. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3707.5200000000004s)]
*  Zoran. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3708.36s)]
*  Zoran. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3709.2000000000003s)]
*  Do you guys remember that movie Big [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3710.96s)]
*  and he would go to the arcade [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3712.38s)]
*  and there was a call to ask Zoran. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3713.5200000000004s)]
*  It was Zoran. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3715.28s)]
*  Zoran. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3716.1200000000003s)]
*  Zoran. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3716.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3717.8s)]
*  Ask Zoran, can I have free pizza? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3719.52s)]
*  I'm gonna run for New York mayor [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3721.4s)]
*  and I'm offering everybody free pizza and bagels. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3723.0s)]
*  I'm gonna win. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3726.16s)]
*  Let me pick up on what Jamal said [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3728.24s)]
*  about Zoran running an effective campaign. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3729.68s)]
*  Cause it is true. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3731.72s)]
*  And I think one of his best moments was during a debate [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3732.8199999999997s)]
*  where the moderator asked the candidates, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3736.3199999999997s)]
*  which foreign country would you visit first [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3739.68s)]
*  as mayor of New York city? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3743.2799999999997s)]
*  And the other candidates said Ukraine [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3745.2799999999997s)]
*  or Israel, they're basically virtue signaling. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3748.08s)]
*  And then they get ma'am Donnie. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3750.88s)]
*  And he said, nowhere, I wouldn't go anywhere. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3753.2799999999997s)]
*  I would stay in New York city. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3755.08s)]
*  I would work for the people here. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3756.14s)]
*  I wouldn't be going to foreign capitals. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3758.56s)]
*  And he just crushed that answer. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3760.7599999999998s)]
*  Now his political solutions, [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3763.2s)]
*  his programs are not gonna work. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3765.04s)]
*  But the reason why he's catching fire [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3766.48s)]
*  is partly because he is putting New York first. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3768.98s)]
*  The same way that president Trump is putting America first. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3772.36s)]
*  The American people are sick and tired [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3775.16s)]
*  of the politicians focusing on far away places [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3778.08s)]
*  instead of their problems at home. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3781.56s)]
*  It's like the Biden administration [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3783.2799999999997s)]
*  going off and defending the border of Ukraine [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3785.3599999999997s)]
*  while leaving the border of the United States wide open. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3788.2s)]
*  And I think that even, you know, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3791.5s)]
*  over the last couple of weeks, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3792.96s)]
*  you saw that substantial majorities of the American people [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3794.0s)]
*  did not wanna get into a new Middle Eastern war. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3798.04s)]
*  And I think this is the failure of both the neoliberals [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3801.7999999999997s)]
*  and the neoconservatives, which aren't that far apart. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3805.3199999999997s)]
*  They are clinging to this post-World War II fantasy [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3807.56s)]
*  of America being this global empire [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3810.72s)]
*  where we have to be the global policeman [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3812.7599999999998s)]
*  while America back home is collapsing, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3814.3599999999997s)]
*  or at least rotting. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3817.3199999999997s)]
*  It's suffering, yeah. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3818.16s)]
*  It's suffering. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3819.0s)]
*  They want the politicians to be focusing [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3819.8199999999997s)]
*  on our problems back home. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3821.8599999999997s)]
*  100%. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3823.72s)]
*  And Karen Bass is that moment. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3824.56s)]
*  Like if you need to understand that moment, [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3826.12s)]
*  she's in Ghana, she knew this place was gonna go on fire. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3828.08s)]
*  She extends her trip. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3831.3799999999997s)]
*  She doesn't come back. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3832.3999999999996s)]
*  Disgracee-odd to the highest degree. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3833.92s)]
*  All right, there's a lot of other stuff on the docket. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3836.92s)]
*  We could go two ways, but I think Freberg, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3840.6800000000003s)]

*  Do you guys want to talk about age reversal? [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3962.3599999999997s)]
*  Okay, yeah, let's talk about age reversal [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3964.24s)]
*  while I hit this. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3967.0s)]
*  As is the case with most cutting edge science nowadays, [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3969.2799999999997s)]
*  it is coming out of China and not out of the United States. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3972.16s)]
*  So this research study was done on age reversal. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3974.56s)]
*  We've talked about using these Yamanaka factors [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3978.2s)]
*  to change the epigenome of cells [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3981.12s)]
*  and make them youthful again. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3983.08s)]
*  In this particular case, the study was done [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3984.84s)]
*  on engineering stem cells [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3988.36s)]
*  that were then placed into the bodies of monkeys [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3991.04s)]
*  and reverse the age of these monkeys [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3993.72s)]
*  on the order of what would be the equivalent of humans [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3995.44s)]
*  of several decades of age reversal. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3997.72s)]
*  It's a pretty amazing and astounding result. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=3999.7599999999998s)]
*  So cell therapy is the modality [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4001.64s)]
*  that would be kind of employed at scale for humans [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4004.12s)]
*  to utilize this tool. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4006.68s)]
*  There's a lot of work that's been done in age reversal [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4007.96s)]
*  in mice, some work in primates, some work in humans now. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4010.48s)]
*  And there's obviously a few startups doing this [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4014.44s)]
*  based on the studies and research around Yamanaka factors. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4015.8399999999997s)]
*  So kind of changing the epigenome [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4019.48s)]
*  and effectively getting cells to act youthful again. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4021.64s)]
*  In this particular case, this team focused on [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4025.8399999999997s)]
*  a specific gene that it is known that when this gene [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4029.56s)]
*  is expressed or overexpressed, [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4033.48s)]
*  meaning the gene is turned on, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4035.04s)]
*  it actually creates a whole bunch of signaling molecules, [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4037.08s)]
*  little tiny molecules that then get absorbed by other cells [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4040.64s)]
*  and tell those cells to start to act young again [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4045.08s)]
*  and reset those cells. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4047.44s)]
*  And that gene is called FOX03. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4048.84s)]
*  So what this research team did is they took stem cells [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4051.7599999999998s)]
*  and they engineered them using CRISPR [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4055.48s)]
*  to get them to overexpress FOX03. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4058.28s)]
*  And so now these cells start making this FOX03 protein. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4061.32s)]
*  And when that cell starts making that FOX03 protein, [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4064.6800000000003s)]
*  it actually makes a whole bunch of other molecules, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4067.4s)]
*  little small proteins, little molecules. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4070.0800000000004s)]
*  They then get packaged up into what are called exosomes. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4072.8s)]
*  These are like little packets that get spud out of the cell [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4076.0s)]
*  and they get absorbed by other cells [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4079.0s)]
*  and trigger those cells, we don't know how, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4080.48s)]
*  we don't know why necessarily, to start acting young again. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4082.32s)]
*  So they engineered these stem cells, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4085.84s)]
*  overexpressed FOX03, [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4087.6800000000003s)]
*  and then put these stem cells in these monkeys. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4089.6800000000003s)]
*  And these monkeys were kind of the equivalent [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4091.96s)]
*  of being 60 years old. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4093.6400000000003s)]
*  And then they looked at what happened. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4096.4800000000005s)]
*  So what happened? [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4098.76s)]
*  Well, they looked at tissue, they looked at blood, [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4099.6s)]
*  and they did MRIs and scans of the brain. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4102.04s)]
*  And what they found is that the monkey's brains [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4104.92s)]
*  effectively started to get completely rewired [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4107.0s)]
*  and act like young brains again. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4109.72s)]
*  They were able to increase their memory, [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4111.4800000000005s)]
*  increase their responsiveness, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4113.24s)]
*  their age-related atrophy reversed, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4114.84s)]
*  so their brains actually grew, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4116.92s)]
*  their bones started to grow, their muscles started to grow, [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4119.4800000000005s)]
*  their blood cells started to reverse aging signals. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4122.72s)]
*  So across bone degeneration reversed, [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4125.76s)]
*  they looked at 61 different tissues [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4128.0s)]
*  from 10 distinct systems in the bodies of these monkeys [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4129.92s)]
*  after they received the stem cell treatment. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4133.8s)]
*  And 54% of the tissue examined showed reversal of age. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4136.400000000001s)]
*  In the case of lungs, they saw in monkeys, [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4140.72s)]
*  it was a four-year age reversal, [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4142.84s)]
*  which is 12 years in humans. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4145.4400000000005s)]
*  Skin reversed by six years, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4146.360000000001s)]
*  which is the equivalent of 18 years in humans. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4147.96s)]
*  So imagine a 60-year-old person [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4149.68s)]
*  taking the suddenly they're 40 years old in their skin. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4152.52s)]
*  Skeletal muscle went by five years in the monkeys, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4155.68s)]
*  which is the equivalent of 15 years in humans. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4158.96s)]
*  So imagine going from being 60 years old [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4161.52s)]
*  to having the body of a 45-year-old in terms of muscles. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4163.4800000000005s)]
*  The spleen, the brain, all across these different systems, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4166.52s)]
*  they saw significant signals of age reversal. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4170.72s)]
*  And then they identified these little exosomes. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4174.16s)]
*  These are like little sacs that are spun out of the cell. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4176.0s)]
*  And then they go into other cells [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4179.92s)]
*  and they start to trigger all of this age reversal cascade [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4181.5199999999995s)]
*  that happens. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4184.88s)]
*  And by the way, they saw no side effects. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4185.72s)]
*  They saw no negative health effects. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4187.4s)]
*  There was no increase in cancer. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4188.76s)]
*  These are the sorts of things you typically look for. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4190.16s)]
*  And in tissue, in blood cells, in MRI, across the board, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4192.48s)]
*  they saw age reversal. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4197.76s)]
*  So it was a really kind of incredible result. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4199.32s)]
*  And I think that it opens up the door [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4201.44s)]
*  for this idea of using cell therapy [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4202.92s)]
*  based on stem cells that are engineered [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4205.08s)]
*  to be injected into blood, [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4207.24s)]
*  to actually reverse aging in humans. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4208.96s)]
*  And I think that we should expect [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4210.84s)]
*  over the next couple of years, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4211.96s)]
*  these sorts of trials to kind of begin [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4213.6s)]
*  to see if we can see similar results. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4216.0s)]
*  There's a lot of background work, by the way, [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4217.32s)]
*  in FOXO3 in this particular gene, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4219.28s)]
*  a lot of background work in engineering stem cells, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4220.84s)]
*  a lot of background work, obviously, in Yamanaka factor [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4223.04s)]
*  and other age reversal that predicated this. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4225.8s)]
*  But this particular paper, I think, [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4228.08s)]
*  put a lot of things together [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4229.52s)]
*  and showed some pretty nice results. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4230.4400000000005s)]
*  Do you think Yamanaka factors are the thing still, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4232.04s)]
*  or do you think that there's going to be [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4237.28s)]
*  a lot of other genetic manipulations [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4239.96s)]
*  that advance age reversal before Yamanaka factors do? [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4242.16s)]
*  The latter is more of what we call [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4246.84s)]
*  like a complex cascade of proteins and molecules [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4249.44s)]
*  that we haven't identified yet, [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4252.24s)]
*  that we don't know how or why they do what they do. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4253.56s)]
*  That's what we just saw with this study. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4255.48s)]
*  We don't know what's in those exosomes sacs. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4257.24s)]
*  And we don't know why they cause other cells [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4260.0s)]
*  to reverse their age. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4263.0s)]
*  We don't quite understand the mechanism. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4264.12s)]
*  It's really hard. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4265.64s)]
*  So I think that this becomes sort of call it an easier path. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4266.96s)]
*  Whereas with the Yamanaka factors, if you apply too much, [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4271.52s)]
*  the cells don't just rejuvenate, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4275.08s)]
*  they can become cancerous. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4277.0s)]
*  So there's, yeah. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4278.44s)]
*  Let me ask it more directly. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4279.52s)]
*  Other than the novelty of all of this, [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4281.48s)]
*  do you think there will be something in the market, [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4284.18s)]
*  some injectable or something that's average people [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4286.88s)]
*  like us can take in the next five or 10 years [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4290.84s)]
*  to solve a problem that we have [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4294.16s)]
*  or to live longer with higher health? [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4295.96s)]
*  Yes, there are clinicals underway right now. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4298.400000000001s)]
*  And I know of the clinical trials that are underway. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4301.88s)]
*  Like in stage three, you're saying? [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4304.16s)]
*  Phase three clinical trials? [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4305.88s)]
*  Early stage one in humans. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4307.32s)]
*  Like one A's? [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4308.72s)]
*  Yeah, very early. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4310.36s)]
*  So maybe a decade from now. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4311.8s)]
*  I think that's right. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4313.6s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, let's see what the FDA does. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4314.4400000000005s)]
*  But the FDA is trying to accelerate outcomes here, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4316.48s)]
*  as you know. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4318.5599999999995s)]
*  Blake Byers came to my house for poker. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4319.4s)]
*  He's sponsoring a study at UCSF, [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4322.639999999999s)]
*  which I thought was incredible. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4325.08s)]
*  You know, the gene that allows Donald Trump [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4326.839999999999s)]
*  to sleep four hours? [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4329.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4331.04s)]
*  They've isolated that gene. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4331.879999999999s)]
*  Clinton had that gene too. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4333.24s)]
*  And Blake is sponsoring a trial [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4335.28s)]
*  to basically edit a handful of subjects who want that gene [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4338.839999999999s)]
*  to see if they can sleep four hours and be rested. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4343.92s)]
*  So I don't know if you guys know this, [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4347.88s)]
*  and he explained this to me, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4349.28s)]
*  and it makes so much sense, but I didn't realize it. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4350.360000000001s)]
*  We sleep 20 years of our life, we're sleeping. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4353.6s)]
*  And so if you can cut it in half, [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4357.28s)]
*  you get an extra 10 years of living. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4359.12s)]
*  If you think about it like that way, [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4361.76s)]
*  that is an incredible reason to, you know, [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4363.12s)]
*  do the gene editing to get the Trump gene. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4366.56s)]
*  But the thing that nobody knows is what the- [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4369.76s)]
*  Books are wrong. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4371.56s)]
*  We could ski all day and play poker all night. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4373.04s)]
*  The thing that they don't know is, you know, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4376.04s)]
*  Trump and Clinton were born with that gene from day one. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4378.64s)]
*  And what they don't know is what could go wrong [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4381.5s)]
*  if you injected and manipulated yourself [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4383.4800000000005s)]
*  at the age of 30 or 40 or 50. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4385.72s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4387.360000000001s)]
*  But wouldn't it be incredible if you could all of a sudden [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4389.7s)]
*  only sleep four or five hours and be completely rested? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4391.96s)]
*  Well, do you remember at the All In Summit, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4395.400000000001s)]
*  Nikki Pollack, she gave a talk on this gene. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4397.280000000001s)]
*  That was her opening piece. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4399.12s)]
*  I mean, that's definitely incites them a lot. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4400.4400000000005s)]
*  I know there's a bunch of labs working [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4402.24s)]
*  on that exact gene target, but this was just amazing [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4403.44s)]
*  because this is a cell therapy. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4406.16s)]
*  So you can kind of think about getting an injection done. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4407.4s)]
*  You get an infusion done of these stem cells [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4410.12s)]
*  and all of a sudden your skin is 20 years younger. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4412.599999999999s)]
*  It's incredible. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4415.679999999999s)]
*  Like my foreskin? [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4417.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, this actually plays out. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4418.4s)]
*  Your foreskin, yeah, if you have it. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4419.76s)]
*  I kept it because it's like a sheath. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4422.8s)]
*  It's like a sheath for the anaconda. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4425.0s)]
*  Like a sleeping bag? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4427.679999999999s)]
*  It's like a sleeping bag. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4429.28s)]
*  Oh, free break. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4432.24s)]
*  Okay, very good. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4435.88s)]
*  It's like a man sleeping in a sleeping bag. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4437.84s)]

*  The startup that I funded that got acquired by Robinhood. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4533.92s)]

*  So now you've got double Robinhood shares? [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4537.92s)]
*  You got it from that and from Launch Fund Lounge? [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4539.5599999999995s)]
*  Shut up, Deepak and Sid, great job. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4541.4s)]

*  And if you move your money into there, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4545.12s)]

*  when you got rid of the $7,500. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4574.0s)]

*  That is a beautiful plane. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4590.2s)]

*  because my plane broke down and I charged it a $7,500. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4593.76s)]

*  You think about the flight to the Middle East [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4671.52s)]

*  with Tucker, all that is now gonna be productive hours [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4677.52s)]

*  In fact, Uber hit a record high today, [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4692.0s)]
*  just two months after the big Trump tariff chaos [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4694.36s)]
*  and the market going down 15, 30%. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4699.04s)]
*  We've had a full recovery [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4701.48s)]
*  from Trump's Liberation Day tariff announcement. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4703.88s)]
*  Yeah, market might even be up one, two, three, 4%. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4707.64s)]
*  Since then, they called it a stunning turnaround [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4711.08s)]
*  at your favorite network, Saks, CNN, [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4714.36s)]
*  called it a stunning turnaround. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4718.36s)]
*  Lots of different things are contributing to this. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4720.64s)]
*  Obviously, you got the ceasefire in the Middle East. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4722.88s)]
*  You've got the trade deals with UK and a truce with China. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4726.400000000001s)]
*  NASDAQ 100 is at an all time high. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4731.88s)]
*  You know, there's also with these tech companies, [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4737.120000000001s)]
*  the perfect storm. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4739.6s)]
*  M&A is back on the menu. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4741.08s)]
*  People are buying companies again, that equals growth. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4742.400000000001s)]
*  People are continuing to lay off the dead weight. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4744.96s)]
*  So you're having earnings rise [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4747.200000000001s)]
*  and then the product announcements coming out of big tech, [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4749.12s)]
*  which I think you sort of alluded to [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4752.76s)]
*  that American companies are firing on all cylinders [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4754.24s)]
*  earlier in the program, Chamath. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4756.32s)]
*  All of this is amazing. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4758.0s)]
*  The AI trade is on. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4760.0s)]
*  So this all equals though, however, [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4762.0s)]
*  big controversy, Friedberg. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4765.28s)]
*  What's the point of cutting rates [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4768.4s)]
*  if we're at an all time high [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4770.4s)]
*  and employment is somewhat full? [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4772.12s)]
*  There are some concerns there, we'll get into it. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4775.0s)]
*  But what are your thoughts here on the market? [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4778.2s)]
*  And then, you know, Trump is going hard at Powell saying, [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4780.88s)]
*  he's gonna fire him saying he's an idiot, he's stupid, [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4784.24s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4786.5599999999995s)]
*  This is the guy he placed by the way. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4787.4s)]
*  So Friedberg, what are your thoughts? [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4788.48s)]
*  And then we'll go to you, Chamath. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4790.08s)]
*  I'm not sure that equity market prices going up [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4791.08s)]
*  is necessarily the best indicator of where we are, [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4795.72s)]
*  because we did have negative GDP growth in Q1. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4800.639999999999s)]
*  Arguably, there was a lot of tariff flipping happening [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4804.12s)]
*  in Q1, but there's a real question [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4806.48s)]
*  on this GDP growth outlook for the rest of this year. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4809.599999999999s)]
*  And we're still running a modest inflation. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4813.679999999999s)]
*  When you combine those two [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4816.839999999999s)]
*  and you combine the government deficit right now, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4818.2s)]
*  there's an argument to be made [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4821.28s)]
*  that we're actually seeing assets inflate, [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4822.959999999999s)]
*  not necessarily, so multiples are going up. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4825.32s)]
*  I think that may actually be a result of kind of an indication [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4829.44s)]
*  that we expect rates to cut, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4833.16s)]
*  that we expect to increase the money supply. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4835.12s)]
*  And again, remember when you end up [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4838.08s)]
*  in this debt death spiral, all assets go up in value. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4840.92s)]
*  They all increase because you start to flood things [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4845.36s)]
*  with cash and as you flood things with printed money, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4848.2s)]
*  when you start to print more money, [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4850.68s)]
*  everything goes up in price. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4851.76s)]
*  So one argument here might be that we're actually [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4853.5599999999995s)]
*  not necessarily seeing an improvement [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4855.76s)]
*  in the fundamental business environment. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4858.24s)]
*  We're not seeing record revenue across the board. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4860.12s)]
*  As we talked about last week, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4862.84s)]
*  the S&P 493 are really struggling [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4864.5199999999995s)]
*  relative to the MAG-7. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4867.679999999999s)]
*  And there's a really kind of questionable outlook ahead [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4870.919999999999s)]
*  for the vast majority of equity cap out there. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4874.44s)]
*  So I would say that there might be a bit [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4877.879999999999s)]
*  of an inflationary aspect to this, [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4879.639999999999s)]
*  not necessarily just a pure business performance upgrade [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4881.2s)]
*  that we're seeing. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4884.839999999999s)]
*  All right, we got Dr. Doom's position. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4885.679999999999s)]
*  I mean that respectfully, [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4887.04s)]
*  but give us the other side, Shamath, if you have one. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4888.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, if I was a betting man, [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4890.959999999999s)]
*  which I am. You are? [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4893.84s)]
*  I think the free money trade here is to be levered long. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4896.2s)]
*  I think you can make a lot of money right now. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4901.400000000001s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4903.4800000000005s)]
*  The first chart I wanna show you is the velocity of money. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4905.360000000001s)]
*  So what is this? [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4909.0s)]
*  This is the M2 money supply. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4909.84s)]
*  It's a measure of how much money is circulating [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4911.56s)]
*  in the economy. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4915.2s)]
*  What this shows is the impact of rates [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4916.56s)]
*  where we were able to start to slow down [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4918.84s)]
*  and contract the money supply. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4921.76s)]
*  But then as you saw, as the economy stabilized [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4924.28s)]
*  and people started to project as possible [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4927.4800000000005s)]
*  in 18 to 24 months, [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4929.56s)]
*  you started to see money coming back into the system. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4931.24s)]
*  That's what has given a bid to the equity markets. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4933.8s)]
*  That's great, because a percentage of this capital [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4938.4800000000005s)]
*  gets allocated into things that can generate [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4941.96s)]
*  a superior return to money markets. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4944.28s)]
*  And that's where the bid to the equity market came from. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4946.64s)]
*  So you would say, well, where does it go from here? [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4951.12s)]
*  The next chart, Nick, if you just give the second one is, [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4953.44s)]
*  look at how much money, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4956.12s)]
*  and again, you can just look at the last five years. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4957.2s)]
*  Look at how much money is sitting in money market funds. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4958.919999999999s)]
*  And what this starts to show you is you have trillions [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4964.2s)]
*  and trillions of dollars of dry powder on the sidelines [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4967.5199999999995s)]
*  that will need to find a home. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4970.839999999999s)]
*  I think that Jerome Powell [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4975.12s)]
*  is in an increasingly untenuous situation, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4977.639999999999s)]
*  because he will be looked at [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4981.56s)]
*  as politicizing the office of the Federal Reserve. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4983.88s)]
*  There is enough data that can justify cutting rates. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4987.040000000001s)]
*  If you cut rates, and we've talked about this before, [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4991.96s)]
*  two things will happen. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4995.080000000001s)]
*  Number one is people will take some amount of money [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=4996.200000000001s)]
*  out of the money market funds, [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5000.0s)]
*  because they will want to go and seek [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5001.280000000001s)]
*  superior returns somewhere else. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5003.92s)]
*  It will increase the velocity of money at the same time. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5006.400000000001s)]
*  You put those two things together, [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5009.4800000000005s)]
*  that is a bid to the equity markets. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5010.96s)]
*  And so if we're at an all-time high today [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5013.4s)]
*  with rates at 4.5% and Powell is back against the wall to cut, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5017.32s)]
*  the only road from here is probably up. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5024.32s)]
*  And so you could see this thing [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5028.8s)]
*  get rerated quite aggressively. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5031.2s)]
*  And then the question is, [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5034.08s)]
*  do you do it where you manage your risk [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5035.2s)]
*  and you're short some stuff, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5037.88s)]
*  or do you just say, you know what, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5039.28s)]
*  I'm just gonna take it all up [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5041.16s)]
*  and take most of my shorts off and let the thing go? [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5043.16s)]
*  I think that if Powell starts an aggressive cutting program, [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5045.24s)]
*  either because he has to, [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5049.24s)]
*  or because he's trying to keep his job, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5051.32s)]
*  I mean, man, you could see the S&P at 7,000. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5053.759999999999s)]
*  Very quickly. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5058.48s)]
*  Sacks, yeah, obviously, [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5059.92s)]
*  you're a member of the administration, [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5062.5199999999995s)]
*  so I don't want to make sure people know [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5065.24s)]
*  you're not speaking for the administration, [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5067.2s)]
*  but I guess your personal thoughts on the markets here [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5069.599999999999s)]
*  and what the right thing for Powell to do is, [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5075.12s)]
*  because he does seem to be in an untenable position. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5077.4s)]
*  He's being criticized super heavily. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5080.5599999999995s)]
*  He might even have his replacement announced [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5082.639999999999s)]
*  before his term is even up in the spring. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5085.72s)]
*  And gosh, what is the reason for Powell to cut rates [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5088.36s)]
*  if everything's going so well, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5092.88s)]
*  and then he would look like maybe he poured gasoline [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5095.16s)]
*  on what appears to be a pretty robust economic fire right now? [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5097.64s)]
*  That's not the right way to look at it. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5106.68s)]
*  The question is, just what's the inflation rate [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5107.96s)]
*  relative to interest rates? [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5109.84s)]
*  And inflation has come down all the way to, I think, 2.4%. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5110.96s)]
*  So it's way down, and we're back to a two-handle. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5114.36s)]
*  I think inflation has largely been licked, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5117.48s)]
*  and it's time to start lowering interest rates, [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5119.8s)]
*  and that will be good for the economy. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5121.92s)]
*  There's no reason for rates to be as high as they are. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5123.44s)]
*  It'll also be good in terms of financing our debt. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5125.92s)]
*  So I think that it is time for Powell to act, [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5128.0s)]
*  and I think he's being overly cautious here. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5131.44s)]
*  He's being slow here, just like he was slow to raise [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5134.28s)]
*  at the beginning of the cycle. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5136.879999999999s)]
*  He's being slow to cut at the end of the cycle. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5138.4s)]
*  And again, I think he's just afraid [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5140.799999999999s)]
*  of being proven wrong here, [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5142.879999999999s)]
*  but I think that the timing is right to start the cuts. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5144.16s)]
*  Now, to go back to the question of [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5146.96s)]
*  how do you trade this market, [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5149.799999999999s)]
*  I have a very simple idea, [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5151.24s)]
*  which is any time that the media tries to sow doom [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5153.48s)]
*  or spread panic about the Trump administration's policies, [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5157.76s)]
*  that's a good time to buy. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5162.0s)]
*  We saw this when Jim Cramer started touting [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5163.44s)]
*  the Black Monday that was coming, [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5165.68s)]
*  and Larry Summers has been out there constantly with his TDS. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5167.68s)]
*  Whenever the media puts these experts on [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5171.4s)]
*  to tell you that there's chaos and doom, [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5173.92s)]
*  that has proven to be an excellent time to buy the dip. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5176.96s)]
*  So I think this is a very easy way [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5180.2s)]
*  to trade the Trump presidency. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5182.0s)]
*  I mean, the conspiracy corner folks are like, [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5183.92s)]
*  Trump's doing this on purpose. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5186.0s)]
*  The volatility in the market is helpful in some way, [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5187.84s)]
*  but it does seem to be the playbook. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5190.12s)]
*  I'm calling this, I don't mean this in a derogatory way. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5192.8s)]
*  Again, I don't like the term taco [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5195.08s)]
*  because I think that's trying to goad Trump into [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5196.8s)]
*  or frame what he's doing as not thoughtful. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5201.28s)]
*  I think it is thoughtful. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5203.72s)]
*  I think he does shock and bore. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5204.5599999999995s)]
*  He does something shocking. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5206.2s)]
*  He pins his negotiation to that [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5207.76s)]
*  and then he's like, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5211.0s)]
*  he's going to have to get to the bottom of this. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5211.84s)]
*  He's going to have to get to the bottom of this. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5213.4s)]
*  Whether it's what's happening in Iran, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5215.2s)]
*  whether it's what's happening with immigration [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5216.8s)]
*  or what happened with tariffs, [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5219.0s)]
*  he starts with a bang and then he falls back [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5220.96s)]
*  to a reasonable position that the markets can digest. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5223.2s)]
*  So you just have to take a 90-day view [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5225.76s)]
*  of everything he's doing and then you'll be fine. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5228.6s)]
*  When he says, we're going to give people 150% tariff, [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5231.0s)]
*  just cut it by two thirds or make it reciprocal, fine. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5234.36s)]
*  And then when he says, we're going to give him [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5237.8s)]
*  the same amount of money that Obama did [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5239.76s)]
*  and that's where it's going to wind up. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5242.2s)]
*  And he says, we're going to smash Iran. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5243.04s)]
*  It's going to be like very strategic [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5246.12s)]
*  and then he's going to give them the path off. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5247.84s)]
*  So he's actually playing a very interesting, [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5249.400000000001s)]
*  perhaps dare I say sophisticated approach this time, [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5252.6s)]
*  which seems chaotic, but there might be a method [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5256.08s)]
*  to the madness, yeah? [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5259.2s)]
*  Well, I think the media has an incentive [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5261.52s)]
*  to spread this side. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5263.64s)]
*  And I think that's the one thing that's going to be [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5265.4s)]
*  a big problem for the media is the media [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5267.36s)]
*  is going to be the ones who are creating the panic. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5269.08s)]
*  And they bring on all these fake networks who've got TDS [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5271.04s)]
*  to basically hype this narrative. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5274.0s)]
*  So my point is just that when the media [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5276.2s)]
*  is spreading this narrative, that's a great time to buy [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5277.799999999999s)]
*  because it's an opportunity for those of us [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5281.4s)]
*  who don't have TDS. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5283.28s)]
*  It's not even TDS, it's ratings. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5284.759999999999s)]
*  I'll just tell you right there, being a media executive [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5286.799999999999s)]
*  for most of my life, if you want to work the left, [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5289.4s)]
*  you say Trump's out of control, look at this chaos, [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5292.16s)]
*  you get ratings, it equals advertising. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5295.36s)]
*  You don't really have to think about it. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5297.92s)]
*  You want to talk to independent media like All In Podcast, [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5298.96s)]
*  talk to people on the left, people on the right [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5301.92s)]
*  who are actually having first principle discussions [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5304.36s)]
*  about this. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5306.76s)]
*  I think it is TDS though. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5307.6s)]
*  I mean, there are some members. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5309.08s)]
*  No, but like just as we were taping, [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5310.6s)]
*  there's just a whole deluge of economic data that came out. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5312.92s)]
*  The GDP print for Q1 came in at minus 0.5%. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5317.2s)]
*  I mean, so how could anybody interpret for Q1? [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5322.88s)]
*  So how could anybody at the Fed [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5327.36s)]
*  or in the media covering the Fed not understand that, [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5329.679999999999s)]
*  by the way, when we were talking about this, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5334.88s)]
*  just like I said that we're probably gonna print [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5336.92s)]
*  like a three handle on GDP and Q2, [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5338.639999999999s)]
*  we also talked about the fact that we were probably [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5340.88s)]
*  gonna have a negative GDP print in Q1. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5342.679999999999s)]
*  So we've been knowing it for months. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5345.16s)]
*  We've basically been calling it right. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5347.04s)]
*  So why is there an inability to just look at the data [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5349.28s)]
*  and just say the obvious truthful thing? [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5352.88s)]
*  So whatever you think of Trump, it doesn't really matter. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5356.4s)]
*  Rates should not be where they are today. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5361.04s)]
*  They should be 50 to 100 basis points lower, period. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5362.8s)]
*  It's categorical. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5365.88s)]
*  He'll do it in September. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5366.719999999999s)]
*  He's gonna do a 25 in September. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5367.54s)]
*  It's obvious. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5368.84s)]
*  There's no logical explanation for it. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5369.679999999999s)]
*  There is a subjective explanation and that's political. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5371.44s)]
*  I think he just, after the tariff stuff, he said, [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5376.88s)]
*  let's just push it out two months, get some more data [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5380.0s)]
*  and then we'll cut it in September. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5383.08s)]
*  What's the difference between a July, August cut [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5384.08s)]
*  or a September? [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5386.68s)]
*  It's probably not gonna be meaningful in the arc of history. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5387.5s)]
*  But if you're against the tariffs and you're buying into [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5389.32s)]
*  Jim Cramer's doom narrative or Larry Summer's doom narrative, [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5392.48s)]
*  that's more of a reason to cut. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5395.3s)]
*  If you believe the doom narrative [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5397.28s)]
*  that he's not gonna relent, yes. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5401.04s)]
*  But if he does relent and he negotiates it, [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5403.08s)]
*  you would say, stay the course and see what happens. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5406.320000000001s)]
*  Anyway, all of this is on the margins. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5408.56s)]
*  The truth is these companies are very strong. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5410.780000000001s)]
*  Entrepreneurship is strong and the debt's the issue. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5413.64s)]
*  So we still gotta address the debt. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5415.96s)]
*  We'll see if he does that in- [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5417.88s)]
*  But to Shabazz's point, the last year [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5418.92s)]
*  of the Biden economy was very weak, [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5421.76s)]
*  especially the last six months of the Biden economy, [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5424.200000000001s)]
*  such that Q1 was negative GDP growth. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5426.240000000001s)]
*  So President Trump came into office inheriting [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5429.4400000000005s)]
*  a very weak economy. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5431.8s)]
*  Since then, he's done a bunch of things to turn it around. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5433.32s)]
*  Yeah, there's obviously gonna be- [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5436.08s)]
*  There's no reason to have interest rates at, [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5436.92s)]
*  what are interest rates at right now? [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5439.04s)]
*  It's five, still at 5%. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5440.36s)]
*  Let's pull up the polymarket just for real quick. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5442.16s)]
*  Fair fact to five, yeah. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5443.92s)]
*  Where he, I think the market thinks 2550 bips [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5445.36s)]
*  is like the 80%, I haven't looked at it in a week. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5449.16s)]
*  Here's September, what are we seeing here? [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5451.719999999999s)]
*  59%, 25 bips, 8%, 50 bips, so you put those together, [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5456.0s)]
*  it's two-thirds chance he's gonna cut in September, [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5460.72s)]
*  obviously, and what does October say? [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5463.2s)]
*  Yeah, so- [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5465.68s)]
*  Is there a polymarket on who replaces Powell, Nick? [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5466.92s)]
*  Is there anything in there about who replaces Powell? [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5469.320000000001s)]
*  He's gonna announce it, I mean, [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5471.360000000001s)]
*  I think he'll just announce it and he'll make Besant. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5473.84s)]
*  People seem to like Besant, he feels like a steady hand, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5477.6s)]
*  he feels like he's got experience, [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5480.2s)]
*  it's obviously gonna be Besant. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5481.56s)]
*  Who is the most likely new Fed chair or something like that? [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5482.96s)]
*  I think it's Besant, here we go. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5485.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, there it is. Let's see. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5487.12s)]
*  Chris Waller, really? [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5488.52s)]
*  Besant only 14%, I think that's your sleep right there, [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5491.4800000000005s)]
*  but listen, there's one, two, three, four, five, six people [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5493.160000000001s)]
*  with 14 to 22%, so this is a- [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5497.360000000001s)]
*  Besant's only at 14%, yeah, I agree, that seems low. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5499.4800000000005s)]
*  And Hassett's at 18. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5502.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, I work with both Besant and Hassett [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5503.4800000000005s)]
*  and I know them both well and they'd both be great. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5505.8s)]
*  They both would be great, right? [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5508.280000000001s)]
*  They both have a ton of experience, [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5509.160000000001s)]
*  a lot of time in the game, which is what you want. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5511.320000000001s)]
*  Warsh has been in the game for a long time, [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5514.64s)]
*  he really knows how the markets work. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5516.4400000000005s)]
*  Trimoth, is this a case of, or Sax, [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5521.360000000001s)]
*  is this a case of picking, you have a bench, [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5523.120000000001s)]
*  do you wanna move Besant out of where he's doing a good job? [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5527.120000000001s)]
*  I think Besant's crushing a treasury, [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5529.76s)]
*  I would love to keep him in the job, so- [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5531.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's the decision, right? [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5533.72s)]
*  I think the thing is elevating Waller has, [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5535.320000000001s)]
*  that's an interesting set of implications. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5538.400000000001s)]
*  Warsh is very consummate and capable of doing the job, [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5540.04s)]
*  the question is, does Trump believe he's MAGA [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5543.04s)]
*  or does Trump believe he's more established Republican? [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5544.92s)]
*  Sorry, there's another name on the list that we forgot. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5547.120000000001s)]
*  Is it John Musk or Trump? [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5549.28s)]
*  Oh, Trimoth is in there. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5551.16s)]
*  Oh, okay, let's see. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5552.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay, well, let's get those numbers up, [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5554.88s)]
*  those are rookie numbers, you can make 99.8 cents. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5556.5199999999995s)]
*  I think that I'm part of a cascade [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5560.48s)]
*  that happens if something else happens, but that's not- [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5563.2s)]
*  So you put $1,000 in and you'll make three bucks. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5565.28s)]
*  Yeah, sorry, let's end on this AI training, [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5568.8s)]
*  this is a super important story we talked about here. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5571.44s)]
*  Anthropic received a favorable ruling [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5573.76s)]

*  Interestingly, on top of that, I did a licensing deal, [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5627.639999999999s)]
*  Harper's Business did a deal with Harper's with Microsoft [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5630.36s)]
*  and they got paid 2,500 books to license Angel [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5633.84s)]
*  for their model, so there are also legal routes. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5636.56s)]
*  Per page? [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5640.12s)]
*  No, literally for the whole book. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5641.96s)]
*  And I didn't, I know it's crazy. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5644.08s)]
*  No, everybody got the same deal. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5645.92s)]
*  They licensed like, I don't know, 5,000 books or something. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5647.4400000000005s)]
*  Per word? [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5650.96s)]
*  Per word, wow, I used to get $3 a word back in the day, [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5651.96s)]
*  but actually for that book, what did I get? [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5654.68s)]
*  I got $25 a word, I guess, with a million dollar deal. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5656.52s)]
*  So Metta also prevailed against a group of notable authors, [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5660.679999999999s)]
*  including Sarah Silverman. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5664.679999999999s)]
*  Now we know why he's so long-winded. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5665.96s)]
*  He gets paid by the word. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5668.08s)]
*  By the word. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5669.2s)]
*  Absolutely, now you know. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5670.04s)]
*  That's actually my till of all in. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5671.16s)]
*  Now we know why no one wants to cut anything. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5672.0s)]
*  This goes on and on and on. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5673.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5675.4s)]
*  It goes on and on and on. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5676.24s)]
*  Absolutely, that's why we're the number one podcast [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5677.08s)]
*  in the world. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5679.32s)]
*  You guys can send me my flowers, [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5680.4s)]
*  you know the address of the ranch. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5681.719999999999s)]
*  Okay, so there was another one with Metta [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5682.839999999999s)]
*  and although the judge ultimately sided with Metta, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5684.879999999999s)]
*  he had a mixed ruling, basically said [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5688.56s)]
*  that copyright protected works without permission [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5690.52s)]
*  is generally illegal, but the plaintiffs in that case [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5692.56s)]
*  failed to present any compelling arguments [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5696.360000000001s)]
*  that there were actual market harm. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5699.240000000001s)]
*  That's a key one. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5701.280000000001s)]
*  You have to have some harm in these cases [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5702.64s)]
*  in order for it to play. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5704.92s)]
*  Ton of other cases still in play. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5706.400000000001s)]
*  The big one is the New York Times versus OpenAI [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5708.0s)]
*  and Getty Images versus Stable Diffusion [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5710.72s)]
*  will follow those as they make their way through the courts. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5713.360000000001s)]
*  But here you are, Zach. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5717.280000000001s)]
*  You are the czar of AI, [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5719.08s)]
*  so I don't know if we're getting an official position here [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5720.96s)]
*  or just your personal thoughts on this, [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5723.639999999999s)]
*  but what's the interpretation of these two early cases [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5725.96s)]
*  by the czar, David Sachs? [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5730.16s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you my point of view. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5732.32s)]
*  I don't know that I can speak for everybody, [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5734.88s)]
*  but I'll give you my point of view, [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5736.36s)]
*  which actually is the same point of view [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5737.8s)]
*  I gave on this podcast a year or two ago [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5739.08s)]
*  because we had this debate over fair use [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5741.32s)]
*  and me and Friedberg were on one side [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5743.24s)]
*  and you were on another side. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5744.599999999999s)]
*  This judge in the Anthropocase, [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5746.16s)]
*  the reasoning that he gave was almost identical [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5748.4800000000005s)]
*  to what Friedberg and I were arguing a year ago. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5751.72s)]
*  The distinction he made is between input and output. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5755.68s)]
*  If an AI model outputs some text [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5759.72s)]
*  that is basically a ripoff of someone else's copyright, [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5763.8s)]
*  then of course it's guilty of copyright violation. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5767.64s)]
*  But the inputs or pre-training is something different. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5770.28s)]
*  And what AI models do in pre-training [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5773.84s)]
*  is they take millions of texts, millions of documents, [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5775.8s)]
*  and they understand the positional relationship [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5779.320000000001s)]
*  of the words and they translate that into math, [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5783.0s)]
*  into a vector space called positional encoding. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5787.16s)]
*  That is a transformation of the underlying work [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5790.28s)]
*  in the same way that a human can read a body of works [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5792.76s)]
*  and then come up with their own point of view. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5797.2s)]
*  That is basically what AI models are doing. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5798.72s)]
*  So if AI models violate someone's copyright [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5801.0s)]
*  by outputting something that's identical, [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5803.360000000001s)]
*  then obviously that's a violation. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5805.12s)]
*  But if all they're doing is transforming the work, [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5807.08s)]
*  they're doing positional encoding [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5809.96s)]
*  and then coming up with their own unique work product, [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5811.48s)]
*  this judge said that that is not a violation of copyright. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5813.96s)]
*  I completely agree with that. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5816.24s)]
*  One other point, one other distinction this judge made [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5818.92s)]
*  that I think is very important [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5821.84s)]
*  is the difference between pirating and copyright. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5823.32s)]
*  What the judge said is, look, you have to buy the book [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5825.76s)]
*  if you're gonna basically do pre-training on it. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5828.8s)]
*  You can't rip it off. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5830.68s)]
*  That would be piracy, [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5832.08s)]
*  but that's different than copyright. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5833.6s)]
*  And so I agree with that too. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5835.36s)]
*  Now, just one final point on this is- [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5837.64s)]
*  How would you, Sachs, on that point, [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5839.72s)]
*  how would you propose a large language model [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5842.6s)]
*  take a million books and put it in? [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5845.88s)]
*  Would they buy the physical books, scan them in? [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5847.68s)]
*  If you were to- Yeah, just buy the book. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5850.36s)]
*  So what Anthropic did is they created [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5851.4s)]
*  this large repository of books [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5853.0s)]
*  and unfortunately some of them weren't paid for. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5856.04s)]
*  They were pirated material. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5858.0s)]
*  And so Anthropic is- Allegedly, by the way. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5860.12s)]
*  Allegedly is in some hot water. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5862.36s)]
*  And then I think there is some case [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5863.64s)]
*  that's gonna move forward about that. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5865.64s)]
*  But the judge distinguished, again, [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5867.76s)]
*  between piracy and copyright. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5869.28s)]
*  So the point is what Anthropic should have done, [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5871.08s)]
*  apparently, is buy each copy of the book [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5873.28s)]
*  that they put in their repository. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5876.92s)]
*  If they had done that- Scan them in. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5878.24s)]
*  Scan them in, they wouldn't have had [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5879.68s)]
*  this piracy claim against them. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5880.8s)]
*  But again, that is separate from copyright. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5883.5599999999995s)]
*  Just one final point on this is, [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5886.28s)]
*  I think it's very important that we end up [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5888.04s)]
*  with a sensible fair use definition, [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5890.68s)]
*  like the one the judge has come up with [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5893.04s)]
*  in this Anthropic case, [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5894.92s)]
*  because otherwise we will lose the AI race to China. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5896.36s)]
*  The fact of the matter is China's not gonna care [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5899.24s)]
*  about American copyright policy. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5901.4s)]
*  They are gonna train on every scrap of data [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5903.48s)]
*  that's available to them on the internet. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5906.36s)]
*  Apparently they use a pirated book archive called LibGen. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5908.76s)]
*  And so they're not gonna abide by copyright laws at all. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5912.24s)]
*  And if we don't allow our AI models to, again, [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5916.76s)]
*  have a sensible fair use definition [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5920.64s)]
*  that allows them to train but not violate an output, [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5923.280000000001s)]
*  then we will lose to Chinese AI models [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5927.26s)]
*  because they'll have more data. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5929.76s)]
*  And the fact is that the more data that you have, [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5930.64s)]
*  the better your AI model. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5933.0s)]
*  So I do think it's very important for the US [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5934.68s)]
*  to consolidate around a fair use definition [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5936.68s)]
*  that makes sense. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5938.56s)]
*  I'm not saying that this Anthropic case [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5939.56s)]
*  will be the final word. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5941.2s)]
*  I think there will be other cases [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5942.240000000001s)]
*  that come up with other definitions. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5943.96s)]
*  There may be other judges that disagree. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5946.32s)]
*  Ultimately, I think this is going to the Supreme Court. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5947.92s)]
*  But where we need to end up [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5950.28s)]
*  is with some sort of fair use definition that makes sense. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5951.88s)]
*  Otherwise we will lose AI race to China. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5955.84s)]
*  Your view, J. Cal. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5957.92s)]
*  Yeah, obviously as a content creator, [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5960.2s)]
*  I'll take the other side of this. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5962.36s)]
*  There is a nuance between training [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5963.719999999999s)]
*  and there is a nuance between the output. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5965.36s)]
*  I like to look at this as an opportunity. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5967.32s)]
*  YouTube really did a great job [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5969.12s)]
*  with their content ID system of navigating this. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5971.12s)]
*  Google has the most experience here [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5974.12s)]
*  with Google Images and Google News. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5976.72s)]
*  The one box where you get a little snippet up top [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5978.5599999999995s)]
*  and the output is where this is really going to favor [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5981.64s)]
*  the content holders because these will be [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5984.8s)]
*  competitive products in the marketplace. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5986.5199999999995s)]
*  The need to buy a New York Times subscription [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5989.04s)]
*  is no longer necessary. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5992.6s)]
*  You can go onto a language model [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5993.92s)]
*  and ask them to give you Wirecutter as one example [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5995.28s)]
*  I like to cite. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5998.76s)]
*  What are their best picks for these air conditioners [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=5999.8s)]
*  or microphones for podcasting and they will give it to you. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6004.160000000001s)]
*  And when they started doing that, [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6006.84s)]
*  that was my main reason to subscribe [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6008.04s)]
*  to the New York Times and I no longer subscribe to it. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6009.400000000001s)]
*  I subscribe to OBI because they can get [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6011.200000000001s)]
*  the same information there. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6012.52s)]
*  These cases will be very easy to win. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6014.200000000001s)]
*  And so I'm going to explain two things. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6016.52s)]
*  One, how you can win this case as a content company. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6018.04s)]
*  And then two, I'm going to give how the large language models [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6021.400000000001s)]
*  can importantly win the AI race [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6025.72s)]
*  and actually not destroy the business [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6028.64s)]
*  on which they are built on. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6031.8s)]
*  These language models have nothing [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6033.68s)]
*  without the content creators and the authors of these books [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6034.72s)]
*  of which I am one. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6036.96s)]
*  They need us. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6038.48s)]
*  And so they should want to pay us. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6039.76s)]
*  They should want us to be compensated [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6041.68s)]
*  because that will keep us more competitive than China, [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6043.92s)]
*  which we'll just steal at one time. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6046.88s)]
*  So here's how you win if you're a publisher. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6048.72s)]
*  All you have to do is Disney, [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6052.04s)]
*  which is suing Mid Journey right now [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6053.68s)]
*  for obvious copyright violations [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6056.8s)]
*  on the output in my interpretation. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6059.08s)]
*  All you have to do is do a Marvel me, [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6061.48s)]
*  make yourself into a Marvel character, Disney me, [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6063.96s)]
*  or choose your own adventure Star Wars [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6067.04s)]
*  and allow consumers to pay for that product. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6068.799999999999s)]
*  And any author right now that pops up a website that says, [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6071.2s)]
*  subscribe to the angel book and ask questions of it, [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6074.36s)]
*  $10 for life, a dollar per year, whatever it is, [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6078.5199999999995s)]
*  they will be able to prove damages very easily. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6081.919999999999s)]
*  And they will be able to prove [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6085.16s)]
*  that these language models are competitive. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6086.16s)]
*  When they do that, [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6088.839999999999s)]
*  then all of the output will need to be scrubbed [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6090.04s)]
*  or contained in some way. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6095.04s)]
*  You can see this today. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6096.72s)]
*  If you ask ChatGPT, which is the main target [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6097.76s)]
*  since they're making $10 billion a year off of, [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6100.96s)]
*  in many ways, content creators work. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6104.04s)]
*  That's why they're the big target [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6107.28s)]
*  because they have the most money. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6108.4s)]
*  They will not let you make certain images, [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6109.6s)]
*  copyrighted images, specifically the Disney ones. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6111.6s)]
*  Go ahead and try. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6113.48s)]
*  Go try to make a Darth Vader image and they will stop you. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6114.3s)]
*  So they know they're doing it wrong [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6116.76s)]
*  and they've already put the controls in place. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6118.0s)]
*  You need to show that this is your opportunity [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6120.08s)]
*  as a content creator. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6122.56s)]
*  And now to my second point, Sax, which is the very easy. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6123.96s)]
*  So that's how you can prove your case [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6127.84s)]
*  and win hands down versus all language models. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6129.52s)]
*  Put a competitive product in the market, you will win. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6132.2s)]
*  Then the second piece that'll make this tenable is, [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6135.04s)]
*  ChatGPT is making $10 billion a year, according to reports, [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6139.56s)]
*  they should give 30% of their revenue, [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6142.38s)]
*  a small amount, the minority of their revenue, [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6144.56s)]
*  to the top 1000 newspapers, publications, [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6147.04s)]
*  podcasts, books, et cetera. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6150.0s)]
*  And they should do that programmatically. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6152.98s)]
*  And then they should hope that those companies [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6154.44s)]
*  double their revenue and increase their investment. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6156.86s)]
*  And then ChatGPT and the New York Times should do a deal. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6159.76s)]
*  And I predict they will do this. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6162.48s)]
*  Or with another language model that's smart enough to do it. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6164.0s)]
*  Where when you go to ChatGPT [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6166.4s)]
*  and you do a search from the New York Times, [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6168.58s)]
*  you say, what does the New York Times say about Iran? [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6170.36s)]
*  Or what do they say about, you know, [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6172.16s)]
*  the wire cutters say about cameras? [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6174.28s)]
*  It should say authenticate [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6176.2s)]
*  with your New York Times subscription [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6177.16s)]
*  to have access to this. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6178.5199999999995s)]
*  And on the New York Times website, [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6180.16s)]
*  they should say authenticate with ChatGPT. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6181.7s)]
*  This would allow them to have a competitive advantage [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6184.08s)]
*  versus Anthropic and, you know, Apples and whoevers. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6187.3s)]
*  And this will become a massive competitive advantage [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6191.639999999999s)]
*  for the language models, just like cable channels might, [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6194.639999999999s)]
*  or Hulu might feature Disney Plus or, you know, FX [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6197.5599999999995s)]
*  or whatever stations or content it is. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6201.5199999999995s)]
*  Whoever does this first on the other side [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6204.04s)]
*  will make a tremendous amount of money [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6206.36s)]
*  because they will have access to all that data [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6208.28s)]
*  and the output so you can make your kids a t-shirt [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6211.2s)]
*  or a birthday invitation, you know, [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6214.4s)]
*  using the Star Wars characters. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6217.4s)]
*  That's the easy way for us to win as Americans [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6219.12s)]
*  by respecting content creators and paying the money [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6222.72s)]
*  so they can reinvest. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6225.84s)]
*  The amount of money we're talking about here [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6227.46s)]
*  is de minimis for the tech industry. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6228.88s)]
*  These companies are gonna be worth- [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6230.68s)]
*  30% of revenue when the company's losing tons of money? [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6231.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's their problem. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6234.96s)]
*  That's not sex, that's their problem. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6235.96s)]
*  There's no legal basis for that. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6237.8s)]
*  It's such a specific proposal. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6239.64s)]
*  There's no legal basis for it. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6241.68s)]
*  Well, I mean, there is, the music industry. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6242.52s)]
*  If you wanna play music in your restaurant, you have to pay. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6244.52s)]
*  If you wanna cover somebody's song, you gotta pay. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6247.16s)]
*  If you wanna perform it, you have to pay. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6249.56s)]
*  So there is tons of precedent for it. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6250.88s)]
*  If you want to play a Disney film [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6253.2s)]
*  at your kid's birthday party, [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6255.78s)]
*  yeah, you can get away with it. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6257.0s)]
*  But if you do it and you invite people to public- [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6258.12s)]
*  You're gonna guarantee that Chinese models [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6259.84s)]
*  like Deep Sea Carpenter are better than American models [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6262.16s)]
*  because they're not gonna go through any of that. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6263.08s)]
*  So that's your reason of why people should steal? [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6264.48s)]
*  Yeah, because they're just gonna train on, [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6266.5199999999995s)]
*  no, not steal. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6267.4s)]
*  I don't think it's stealing. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6268.5s)]
*  The output I'm talking about specifically. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6270.12s)]
*  Is the output stealing or not? [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6271.679999999999s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, you can't copy the output. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6272.5199999999995s)]
*  I fully agree there. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6275.0s)]
*  And that is what the Disney case is about. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6276.32s)]
*  No, I'm talking about free training. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6278.32s)]
*  I'm talking about the latter. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6280.08s)]
*  So let's talk about the latter here. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6281.12s)]
*  I'm talking specifically on the output. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6282.48s)]
*  No one disagrees on output. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6284.0s)]
*  So that's the licensing deal I'm talking about. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6286.28s)]
*  Don't you think it would be worth it [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6287.94s)]
*  to give Disney $100 million a year [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6289.0s)]
*  to have access to all that in your image? [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6291.16s)]
*  I think you and I have different definitions of output. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6292.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6294.92s)]
*  I think it's reasonable to pay Disney for pre-training. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6296.08s)]
*  And I think that they do. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6298.44s)]
*  I told you this, like we did a licensing deal with OpenAI, [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6301.36s)]
*  we meaning, you know, Beast. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6304.2s)]
*  They paid us and they're using it for pre-training. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6306.72s)]
*  It's quite reasonable. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6309.32s)]
*  Is it the right price? [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6310.76s)]
*  We have no idea. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6311.6s)]
*  But we did it so that we could be a part of the conversation [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6312.92s)]
*  and shape how these deals get done for content creators. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6315.6s)]
*  But Sax is right. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6319.76s)]
*  Like if you think about like, [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6320.6s)]
*  what is the ultimate output? [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6321.4400000000005s)]
*  The output, if you look at how a transformer behaves, [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6324.8s)]
*  it's almost, it's impossible to say [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6327.96s)]
*  that it's copying the input. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6329.92s)]
*  Just not how it works. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6332.08s)]
*  And so I don't know what else to do except that. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6333.2s)]
*  The input gets turned into math. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6336.04s)]
*  What gets recorded is vector math [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6336.88s)]
*  on the relationship between the words. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6339.92s)]
*  This is all a very interesting technique. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6342.96s)]
*  And then somehow when you feed that into a neural net [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6343.8s)]
*  with billions and billions of documents, [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6346.72s)]
*  it somehow has an understanding and produces new content. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6348.36s)]
*  And that new content is not a copyright violation. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6352.08s)]
*  So I just think that like copyright's [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6355.0s)]
*  the wrong way to look at this. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6356.28s)]
*  This is a new technology. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6357.24s)]
*  It's transformational. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6358.2s)]
*  And then finally we have the national security concern. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6359.719999999999s)]
*  All right, so this is a topic we will monitor. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6362.32s)]
*  Thanks again for listening [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp75wqOrtBs&t=6365.0s)]
