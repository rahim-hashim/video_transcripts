# Trump's First Week: Inauguration Recap, Executive Actions, TikTok, Stargate + Sacks is Back!
**All In Podcast:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk)
*  So we had a dinner where me and Friedberg and J. Cal were invited to have dinner with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=0.0s)]
*  the folks from And their other top podcast. It was an off the record dinner. Let's talk all about [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5.04s)]
*  it. There was an interesting moment which even Friedberg had to recognize, which was we went [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=9.44s)]
*  around and said, Hey, what podcast are you listening to? Which ones are your favorites? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=14.08s)]
*  We went out in the room and I got to tell you, you know what your podcast or favorite podcast is? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=17.52s)]
*  Bingo. All in podcasts. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=22.32s)]
*  Well, the funniest thing is my wife thinks I'm bullshitting all the time. I say this is a- [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=24.0s)]
*  Mine too. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=27.92s)]
*  Pretty reasonably successful and well, she doesn't believe it. She thinks we're all bullshitting. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=28.72s)]
*  Why do you think I waited to make my world podcast premiere for all in all the ankle [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  biters called and I said, no, I'm just going to wait to the besties call. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=37.12s)]
*  Can we just say it? Nick, you got to be when the podcast called, you're like, nope, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=43.28s)]
*  can't do it. Sorry. I'm waiting for the real deal. I don't need JV. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=47.68s)]
*  All right, everybody. Welcome back to the number one business finance technology [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=58.72s)]
*  science podcast in the world. This is the place where we call balls and strikes, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=73.76s)]
*  where we tell the truth, where there is zero censorship. Every week we tell you about the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=80.64s)]
*  truth behind the most important stories. We point out who the heroes are and who the villains are, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=87.36s)]
*  who are the delightful ones and who are the dyskratia with me again on this week's program. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=93.2s)]
*  The cackling chairman dictator, my guy, Tia, how you doing? How was your victory lap? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=100.0s)]
*  How was your victory? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=107.36s)]
*  It was really, really, really fun. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=108.08s)]
*  You look like you were in your afterglow and I have to say, Nat was looking pretty good. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=110.16s)]
*  We have some pictures. Don't worry, we're going to go through behind the scenes. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=116.96s)]
*  Armani came through for Amore, the Amore collection from Armani coming this fall. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=120.08s)]
*  By the way, I mean, Armani couture is like firing on all cylinders. The other one, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=126.0s)]
*  which you'll see is a great picture of this incredible jacket, Luisa Beckeria. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=131.44s)]
*  Two shout outs, Armani and Luisa Beckeria. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=136.32s)]
*  You know, I was just thinking that Armani really has been making it happen. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=138.32s)]
*  Now that we've talked about that, we'll talk about my wardrobe when the time comes. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=141.76s)]
*  Just get through the rest of the interest. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=144.8s)]
*  And of course, here he is, your sultan of science, David Friedberg. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  Move along, J.K. Let's go. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=154.88000000000002s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=156.08s)]
*  Had a wonderful time. He's very bitter today. He's got a lot of anger. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=156.56s)]
*  He is the barista of bitterness today. He's serving up bitterness all day long. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=161.28s)]
*  And he had a great time at the, maybe he's a little upset about the Lex Friedman [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=165.52s)]
*  triangle we're in right now. I think that could be part of it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=170.56s)]
*  And we have a special guest here. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=173.04s)]
*  Thomas LaFont is the co-founder of Cotou Management. They got a 50-billion under [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  management, public, private, yada, yada. Before that, he worked at Creative Artists Agency for [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  seven years after he went to college. So he does have the college degree. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=189.76s)]
*  He signed Captain America, which is Friedberg's favorite avenger. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  Chris Evans. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=199.12s)]
*  Chris Evans. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=199.76s)]
*  And has Friedberg- [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=201.04s)]
*  Still a CIA client, by the way. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  Yes. And you're still in touch with him? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  I am not. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=207.04s)]
*  You're not. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=208.32s)]
*  But I've watched with wonder at what he's achieved after I left being his agent. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  It's been incredible. Great career. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  Now behind you, we see this incredible view. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  No, but wait, you're missing the one part, which is that Thomas was one of the highest rated [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=219.6s)]
*  speakers that we had at the All-In Summit. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=224.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  That's true, actually. He did really great last year. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=227.12s)]
*  Really crushed it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=229.12s)]
*  Crushed it, of course. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=230.24s)]
*  And I think I'm in the seventh bestie position and hoping potentially after the podcast to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=231.44s)]
*  at least move up by one. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  Okay. So there you go. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  Let's see what happens here. Now what's this view behind you? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=239.12s)]
*  This is Los Angeles. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=241.84s)]
*  I definitely put you ahead of J Cal, Thomas. So you're- [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=243.2s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=246.4s)]
*  You're up a spot. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=246.72s)]
*  Oh my God. He really is serving up the bitterness today. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=247.44s)]
*  He's so mad. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=252.56s)]
*  He's so mad. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=253.12s)]
*  He's so mad. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=254.08s)]
*  You know why he's mad? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=254.72s)]
*  Why is he so bitter? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=255.68s)]
*  I'll tell you why. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=256.4s)]
*  Please. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=257.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=258.32s)]
*  What did I do this time? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=258.88s)]
*  This is for the audience. Jason is complaining all week in the group chat that he has influenza A. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  He's sending pictures of him getting IVs. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=265.44s)]
*  That's true. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=268.64s)]
*  So Freeberg, the conscientious guy and co-founder of the pod that he is, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=269.04s)]
*  says, I will moderate. And then he invests his time. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=274.88s)]
*  He's got a lot of things going on. He's got- [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=280.08s)]
*  He does. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=281.76s)]
*  Potatoes. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=282.24s)]
*  Three kids plus one away. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=282.8s)]
*  He's running a company. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=284.48s)]
*  Strawberries. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=285.76s)]
*  He prepares. And then you wake up after a dose of Tamiflu and decide, no, I'm ready to moderate. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=286.56s)]
*  Of course. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=293.12s)]
*  And you can't just do that because it's not nice. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=293.44s)]
*  All right. Hey, Madame Producer, can you come on the horn for a second here? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=296.4s)]
*  Are we really going to do this? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=302.08s)]
*  We're going to do it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=304.24s)]
*  We're doing it, Madame. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=305.04s)]
*  This is so stupid. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=306.08s)]
*  This is so stupid. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=307.04s)]
*  Ba-ba-booey. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=308.32s)]
*  Did I tell you to get Freeberg involved? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=309.6s)]
*  No. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=312.96s)]
*  No. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=313.92s)]
*  I did it myself. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=314.16s)]
*  Okay. You went rogue. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=315.04s)]
*  Can I say why? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=316.08s)]
*  You can go rogue. I'm fine. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=318.0s)]
*  I said, hey, Jason, how are you feeling? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=319.2s)]
*  You said, horrible. I have the flu. I'm getting an IV tomorrow morning. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=320.96s)]
*  To me, that was like, oh, okay. There's like a 50% chance he misses the show. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  So I reached out to Freeberg. I said, hey, Jason's really sick with the flu. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=328.8s)]
*  Maybe you should just prepare yourself to moderate tomorrow. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=332.56s)]
*  Okay. Now, when did I find out about this? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=335.68s)]
*  I think that was a smart decision, but you, sir, are a small, bitter man. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=338.4s)]
*  And so what you did was you wanted to just- [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  Who? Me? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. You wanted to blow up Freeberg's preparation. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=344.8s)]
*  I found out about this this morning. I found out about this like an hour ago. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=347.6s)]
*  How are you feeling? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=350.64s)]
*  I feel 80% of a normal J-Cow, which is 110% of any other moderator. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=352.24s)]
*  I'm get yourself Andrew Vorisorkin. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. He's genuflecting at Davos to a bunch of mids. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, we're going to get Lex soon. So we're going to get Lex soon. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=364.72s)]
*  Oh, that'd be great. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=368.16s)]
*  Hello. I am Lex Friedman. Welcome to the number one podcast in the world. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=369.68s)]
*  Today on the program, we have Thomas LaFawn, investor in such great companies as- [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=375.04s)]
*  All right. Listen, enough shenanigans. We had so much fun. We tore DC apart. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=381.04s)]
*  Let's start with actually just, Thomas, did you watch any of that on TV? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=385.68s)]
*  Did you think about going? It was really like there were so many tech people in Washington this week. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=390.08000000000004s)]
*  I saw the live stream. I talked to Saks last night to get the download. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=396.24s)]
*  And my takeaway just from watching, especially the executive orders was democracy in action, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=400.96s)]
*  democracy, self-correct, and dictatorships double down. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=408.56s)]
*  And to watch in real time, a country of our scale and a democracy decide to make a change. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=412.96s)]
*  I think that's why we've been great for 250 plus years and will remain great. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=419.68s)]
*  So it was fun to watch. I'm really curious to see what your takeaway was. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=425.28s)]
*  Okay. Well, we'll just go behind the scenes. First of all, it's hard to see that this was [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=429.68s)]
*  me dressed up for Saks's ball. I really brought the heat. This is by the way, Luca Ruginacci [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=434.08s)]
*  is the tailor here. It's hard to see my jacket. Is that a blue coat? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  So this is what I'm saying. I think the picture is very hard to see, but it's a very refined [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=444.48s)]
*  green paisley. Subtle. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=448.88s)]
*  Hard to bring it out. Now, I will say this was the most popular shirt over the entire weekend. This [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=452.96000000000004s)]
*  is just a simple Brioni tuxedo shirt. There's 200 versions of it. I felt bad when I saw it because [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=458.72s)]
*  normally I don't like to wear things that other people are wearing. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=465.20000000000005s)]
*  Correct. What did Michael Saylor think of this? When you saw Michael Saylor at the... [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=468.24s)]
*  You know, I met Michael's CFO, wonderfully nice guy. So this is us at the crypto ball. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=472.72s)]
*  I went for white tuxedo on the first night. I've never had three tuxedos before. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=479.52000000000004s)]
*  David looked really great. I really loved this. And Saks had this incredible tux, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=484.64s)]
*  which was more crypto themed. It sort of looked like the opening scene from The Matrix. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=489.36s)]
*  So there was like this cool print. You can see my green in there a little bit, Thomas. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=494.16s)]
*  Yeah. Got it. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=499.2s)]
*  There's Sky and New Money Sonny, the president of Grok. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=500.32s)]
*  Sundeep Madhra, x.com slash Sundeep. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=504.56s)]
*  Here are the besties. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=507.04s)]
*  Let's be honest, guys. Even in all your business, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=509.84000000000003s)]
*  Freeberg, you felt the love at this moment when we were all back together. Did you not? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=512.16s)]
*  Well, it was about five minutes before this when three of us took a video, a photo. It was great. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=516.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=520.88s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=521.2s)]
*  Do you want me to let you moderate? You can moderate if you want. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=524.96s)]
*  No, no. You're doing a great job, J. Cal. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=527.6s)]
*  You're keeping us on track. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=529.52s)]
*  We're doing fashion still. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=530.96s)]
*  Vinny, Sky, Diego Burdekin, the co-founder of Cloud [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=533.6800000000001s)]
*  Kitchens. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=536.64s)]
*  So handsome, that Diego. Can we go back to the Diego for a second? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=538.08s)]
*  This was the crypto ball. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=540.64s)]
*  Yeah. This was the crypto ball. This was like, this was Sachs' event. It was incredible. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=541.68s)]
*  It was a large number of people there. I was shocked at the number of people at the crypto. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=546.8s)]
*  Oh, it was huge. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=551.84s)]
*  Next level. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=553.6s)]
*  Here's a little poker. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=554.48s)]
*  Oh, behind the scenes. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=555.68s)]
*  With Pinktiff, TK. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  TK, Travis Klein, the co-founder of Uber. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=559.36s)]
*  Oh, look, that's the founder of Uber. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=562.64s)]
*  Hold on. We got to see who's got the biggest stack. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=563.4399999999999s)]
*  Look, it's the founder of Uber next to the third investor in Uber [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=566.08s)]
*  and the founder of Cloud Kitchens next to the investor in Cloud Kitchens. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=571.04s)]
*  This is Peter Thiel's house. This is Katie Hahn and Kyle Cimani, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=574.96s)]
*  my wife and Nicole's wife. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=579.6s)]
*  Amore. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=581.28s)]
*  This is Peter's house. Peter Thiel had this person going around taking pictures. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=582.8s)]
*  Bad lighting. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=587.04s)]
*  Where you got this. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=587.76s)]
*  Not good lighting for you. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=588.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=589.44s)]
*  Good lighting. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=589.76s)]
*  A little powder there. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=590.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=591.04s)]
*  A little bit of lighting. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=591.36s)]
*  This was great. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=592.32s)]
*  Also Peter Thiel's house. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=593.2s)]
*  Yeah, that was great. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=594.72s)]
*  I have to say, Chamath, putting aside... [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=596.24s)]
*  Jason likes being a Republican. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=599.6s)]
*  Here's a dinner that we had. There's Lex Friedman, Julius Genachowski, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=600.8000000000001s)]
*  who's the former chairman of the FCC. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=605.44s)]
*  Little known. The former roommate of Obama. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=608.1600000000001s)]
*  That's probably the name. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=612.08s)]
*  By the way, following this dinner, all those streets were blocked off [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=612.4s)]
*  and there was no way to get around. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=615.52s)]
*  You can see it there. Look, you see the barricades in the right there? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=616.8000000000001s)]
*  It was like 10 degrees Fahrenheit. So we walk out. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=619.76s)]
*  It was like you were going to die after two seconds out there. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=622.24s)]
*  It was so cold. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=625.92s)]
*  Vinnie and I were walking to try and get our car. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=627.04s)]
*  And after walking for like half a mile, we're like, dude, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=630.56s)]
*  there's no way out of this downtown area. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=633.2s)]
*  And Vinnie was shaking. He's like, I'm going to die. I'm going to die. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=634.96s)]
*  I'm going to die. He turns around. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=637.12s)]
*  He goes running back to the restaurant, jumps in, and basically huddles down in the restaurant. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=638.48s)]
*  And then after about 10 minutes, there's no way out. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=645.04s)]
*  It's sort of like you're in a military zone. He's like, I'm going to go for it. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=647.6s)]
*  He runs out, jumps on a scooter, and he disappeared into the distance. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=651.2800000000001s)]
*  And I swore I would never see Vinnie again. I'm like, that's it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=653.44s)]
*  I think it's very smart that Lex wears the same outfit, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=655.7600000000001s)]
*  the black suit with the white shirt with the black tie. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=659.7600000000001s)]
*  I really like the consistency of it, actually. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=661.7600000000001s)]
*  It looks really good. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=664.48s)]
*  It was incredible. He was getting stung every two minutes. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=665.7600000000001s)]
*  It was unbelievable. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=669.84s)]
*  Here's the jacket. This is Louisa Beccaria. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=671.2s)]
*  And then here's the box from Armani. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=673.36s)]
*  Thank you, Jotajar. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=675.2800000000001s)]
*  Whoa, wah wah wee wah. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=676.72s)]
*  Oh, look, there's a little side boob there with Nat. I didn't notice that. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=678.16s)]
*  Hey, who wouldn't? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=682.4s)]
*  That's a... I'm wearing Tom Ford. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=683.8399999999999s)]
*  Oh, shout out Tom Ford. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=686.16s)]
*  Shout out to you. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=688.4s)]
*  Perfect male force. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=689.4399999999999s)]
*  Oh, here's a huge shout out to two guys that I had really wanted to meet in person. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=690.24s)]
*  I finally got the chance to meet. This is at Zuck's party. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=694.7199999999999s)]
*  This is Brendan Carr, who's the incoming chairman of the FCC. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=697.4399999999999s)]
*  Actually, this picture was taken right after he had gotten confirmed. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=700.88s)]
*  This was his first day as the chairman. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=706.5600000000001s)]
*  And then this is a guy who I've been following for a couple of years, Jared Isaacman, who [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=708.1600000000001s)]
*  is now going to run NASA. He's the founder and CEO of Shift Fork Payments. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=713.12s)]
*  But both of these guys are pretty epic. You should follow them on Twitter. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=716.72s)]
*  He did a spacewalk, the first civilian spacewalk. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=720.24s)]
*  He did. He's really, really... [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=722.5600000000001s)]
*  Brendan was really nice. I met him at Peter's event and he told me he's a big fan of the pod. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=724.8000000000001s)]
*  He listens to the show every week. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=729.2800000000001s)]
*  Brendan's amazing. By the way, if you want to see some really amazing tweets, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=729.6800000000001s)]
*  he had some real bangers. He's a very smart guy. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=733.84s)]
*  I've had Brendan on this week in Starbucks a couple of times. He's the guy who fought [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=738.8000000000001s)]
*  for Starlink over wasting $20,000 per home to install broadband. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=744.5600000000001s)]
*  This guy is a hero. And he did that when he was in office under Biden and all that [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=754.08s)]
*  crazy corruption and grief. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=759.6s)]
*  This is a picture of Mike Johnson and his wife. This is a crazy story. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=761.76s)]
*  There was a G7 summit in Italy and Mike and his wife was seated beside my father-in-law, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=766.4s)]
*  Nat's dad, at a dinner. They got to know each other. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=773.5999999999999s)]
*  He, as a proud grandpa, showed Mike and his wife pictures of Nat and myself and our kids. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=776.56s)]
*  And how we actually met in this moment was his wife was like, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=783.28s)]
*  Oh my God, I recognize you. You're Sergio's son-in-law. You're Sergio's daughter. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=786.48s)]
*  It's amazing. And then we had a cool conversation. That was cool. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=791.36s)]
*  And then this is Bill Pulte, who is nominated to run FHFA, which, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=794.96s)]
*  for folks that know, will be in control of the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=800.16s)]
*  And really great guy. Also a co-investor with me and MrBeast. Nat. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=806.08s)]
*  Oh, you're an investor in MrBeast. There you go. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=811.9200000000001s)]
*  This is Mr... I did the series A. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=815.04s)]
*  This is the first time I think you've said it on the spot. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=817.36s)]
*  Here's this thing. So this is where J Cal is at his peak. Go ahead and just play the video. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=819.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't even know what this is. What is that? What did you order? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=823.76s)]
*  All right. I've given it some thought and I'm going to order the $95 Dover Soul. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=826.8s)]
*  I mean, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=834.16s)]
*  having such a great time tearing it up. I did order the $95 Dover Soul. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=846.56s)]
*  This is... Oh, sorry. Oh, that's me and Bobby Kennedy, but this is [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=851.28s)]
*  walking into the Capitol for the inauguration. Oh, wow. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=855.76s)]
*  So you basically, you have to get off... All these buses were taking us in [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=858.56s)]
*  because of the security and then you walk underneath an underground to get into them. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=863.1199999999999s)]
*  And this is Bobby and the guy right there, Cali Means, another great American, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=867.92s)]
*  make America healthy again. All right. Here's a couple of my picks. This is me [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=872.4s)]
*  with somebody who's going to be in the administration. I'm not big on politics, but... [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=877.4399999999999s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard is so... Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=881.1199999999999s)]
*  She's so strong. She came to our party. This is the picture of our party. She is incredible. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=883.1199999999999s)]
*  Well, she came up to me and she... You can always tell who her real fan is. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=889.28s)]
*  I love Tulsi Gabbard. I just want to tell you, J Cal, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=892.72s)]
*  I am a huge fan of the pod. I love what you do. I love the balance you bring to the problem. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=895.84s)]
*  She really liked new details about the podcast. And so I wanted to get a picture with her. So [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=900.08s)]
*  as a joke, I said to her, do you want to take a selfie? I said, I'm okay with this. She goes, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=905.28s)]
*  I was going to ask. I was like, no, I'm preemptively asking. We took it together. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=910.48s)]
*  She's such a star. She is. I think she's going to be great. I like her a lot. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=913.6s)]
*  She's such a star. Oh, well, yeah, this is... Hello. I am Lex Friedman. Today, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=918.0s)]
*  with love and peace in my heart, I am interviewing dictator Idi Amin, who has eaten half his enemies. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=924.08s)]
*  We will share love, kindness, and a fatty liver. Enjoy. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=930.8000000000001s)]
*  So yeah, that was us just tearing it up after the YouTube party where we hung out with Sundar [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=937.2800000000001s)]
*  and Neil from YouTube. They've been very good to us. And then here's one more, I guess. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=942.8s)]
*  And golfer Bryson DeChambeau. Oh, there's me and the Presidente [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=947.4399999999999s)]
*  Twitter. And yeah, this is the podcast crew at the free press party. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=953.4399999999999s)]
*  Okay. Let's talk about key takeaways. Chamath, what is your big takeaway from the weekend? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=958.4s)]
*  I think my biggest takeaway is that if you look in the past, there was a very tight coordination, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=963.76s)]
*  I guess I would say, between private industry and the private sector and the public sector, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=973.92s)]
*  meaning the president and then people who were in charge of managing huge, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=980.48s)]
*  vast swaths of resources in America. And somewhere along the way, that became either unfashionable [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=986.72s)]
*  and uncool, particularly under Democrats. And what I saw was a very broad-based embrace [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=993.5999999999999s)]
*  of business people, because I think that the president understands how important it is to [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1004.0s)]
*  make sure that economically, America is just firing on all cylinders. The one thing to remember, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1009.28s)]
*  like for example, in the inauguration, I know that you saw the picture and it was basically like [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1014.24s)]
*  Meta, Google, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, kind of CEOs, et cetera, founders, Arnaud was there, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1019.4399999999999s)]
*  Mukesh Ambani was there. So it's just business people from the entire world [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1027.12s)]
*  were there. And so I think what it says is America is going to basically turn a totally new page. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1031.92s)]
*  We're not going to ostracize people. We're not going to play favorites. That's the other thing. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1037.6s)]
*  Elon was there right at the beginning. But if you saw all the CEOs of the major companies were [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1042.48s)]
*  there, it's not like he excluded Zuck because of his past issues or anything. Or Sam Altman. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1048.56s)]
*  Or Sam Altman. That was the biggest takeaway. That would be the more notable one, yeah, to exclude. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1053.84s)]
*  That the president doesn't play favorites, that this is like Team America kind of thing. And it [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1059.9199999999998s)]
*  was a projection of tremendous power to the rest of the world. This is what America is about. I [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1065.2s)]
*  loved every minute of it. And I think that this is exactly how the American government should be [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1070.08s)]
*  working, which is hand in hand with private industry to basically set the pace for the rest [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1075.6s)]
*  of the world. Thomas, did you have a takeaway after the weekend? I did. I'm curious what you [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1079.76s)]
*  guys thought, but to me, what was notable from Scott Besson, the new treasury secretary, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1085.04s)]
*  he was asking one of the exchanges about the green energy race with China. And he reframed [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1092.24s)]
*  the debate, I thought incredibly well, where he said, we're not in a green energy race with China. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1098.8s)]
*  We're in an energy race with China. That's right. Right. And he made the point that China is adding [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1103.12s)]
*  100 coal plants, it's adding nuclear. And to me, it was kind of just 137 gigawatt hydro facility, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1108.56s)]
*  which is exactly unbelievable. And it was such a good framing of the debate, because I think, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1116.56s)]
*  Chamath, to your point, it's about reframing the right issues. Right. And I think that just that [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1121.76s)]
*  little piece of dialogue to me is exemplified, you know, and was a really important takeaway. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1126.8799999999999s)]
*  And I think more of what we'll see over the next coming year. Freberg, did you have a takeaway [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1132.4s)]
*  coming out of this? There was just so much, it was so impressive to be there. I definitely echoed the [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1136.0800000000002s)]
*  sentiment about seeing the strength of America represented between the entrepreneurial engine [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1140.48s)]
*  that has driven this country for 250 years, and the government that's meant to serve the people [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1148.24s)]
*  working together to try and take America forward. It was just really inspiring. The one thing that [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1154.4s)]
*  was the biggest kind of observation for me, which was a bit of a disappointment, unfortunately, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1160.16s)]
*  is I feel like DOGE and cost cutting is going to be a lot harder to realize than folks assume. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1164.88s)]
*  Nearly everyone I met with who works in government or is entering government [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1173.92s)]
*  had this, if not disdain for DOGE, a concern that it doesn't really align interests with the [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1179.6000000000001s)]
*  political objectives of politicians, that they need to get more stuff for their constituents in [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1187.36s)]
*  order to get reelected, and that they're not going to vote programs away. They're not going to vote [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1193.1999999999998s)]
*  themselves out of a job, which is effectively what they would do if they cut programs. In fact, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1196.7199999999998s)]
*  I was watching Brooke Rowland's secretary ag confirmation hearing this morning, and Mitch O'Connell [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1201.4399999999998s)]
*  was given the opportunity to ask her questions. You know what his question was? He said, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1209.04s)]
*  in the last farm bill, I was able to get $60 million to build an ag research lab at the [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1213.4399999999998s)]
*  University of Kentucky, and it hasn't started being built yet. It's been four years. What are [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1218.3999999999999s)]
*  you going to do about that? This is literally the intention of so many of these conversations, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1222.56s)]
*  if you sit and watch. Then I watched a similar conversation with a senator from Minnesota, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1227.6s)]
*  who I won't get into all the statements, but every single conversation you hear, and we even [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1232.24s)]
*  talk with Ted Cruz about this. He was great, by the way. I love Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz is excellent. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1238.8s)]
*  It's all about what can I get for my constituents? How do I get more jobs, and how do I get more [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1244.8799999999999s)]
*  money? Ultimately, that incentive is what gets people elected, and I don't think it's going to [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1249.84s)]
*  change. That was the biggest shock for me. I thought that there was a moment of the importance [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1256.1599999999999s)]
*  of cost cutting, the importance of deficit reduction, the importance of debt reduction, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1260.8s)]
*  and I was just a little saddened to kind of see that there's no stopping the train. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1264.72s)]
*  So that was my takeaway. It's a little bit bitter. I hope I'm wrong. I really do hope Doge is [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1270.0s)]
*  effective, and I really do hope that policymakers start to recognize the importance. By the way, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1274.32s)]
*  Ray Dalio has a new book coming out. We'll talk more about his book once it's released publicly, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1279.28s)]
*  but it speaks very clearly to the challenge the United States is now facing with respect to [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1284.0s)]
*  spending. So I know I've talked about this. I know we all felt like there was a big reprieve [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1289.04s)]
*  with this election, but for me, it was a little bit bitter. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1291.84s)]
*  Can I say a little bit on that first topic? I just want to double down on that because one [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1293.76s)]
*  of the things that some folks said, and I guess it makes sense now that you think about it, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1299.6799999999998s)]
*  but when you look at the confirmation hearings, there are certain folks for whom [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1304.24s)]
*  the resource allocation is relatively modest inside of America. They tend to just do much [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1308.32s)]
*  better in general. And if you saw Marco Rubio's confirmation process, it was like 99 to 0. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1313.9199999999998s)]
*  And to your point, what they say is that folks that actually allocate the internal spending [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1322.0s)]
*  in the United States gets a lot more scrutiny because there's all of this horse trading because [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1327.12s)]
*  they want some of this money to get allocated into their specific area. It is going to be a [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1332.72s)]
*  very complicated thing. The one thing though that changed, I don't know if you saw, but [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1338.8799999999999s)]
*  Doge was meant to be outside the auspices of the government, and it wasn't actually a government [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1343.36s)]
*  department. And it'll be interesting to understand when it's explained, but in the 11th hour, the EO [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1350.16s)]
*  that established Doge established it actually as a governmental agency. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1357.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. We're going to get into that in just a moment. And Peter, to build on your point there, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1360.5600000000002s)]
*  Dave, Senator Sanders had a tweet today, Nick, I just sent it to you. Already the discussion of [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1365.52s)]
*  who should take the brunt of these cuts is starting to happen, and he's pointing out, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1371.68s)]
*  as he should, and, hey, what's going to happen with the VA? And you're putting a freeze on hiring [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1377.28s)]
*  people. We have to make sure our vets are taken care of. We have a shortage of doctors, a shortage [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1382.8s)]
*  of nurses, but we do have people responding to him saying, hey, how are we going to pay for all this? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1386.88s)]
*  So even if it's going to be hard to do, it's going to take courage because you're going to be faced [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1392.0s)]
*  with situations like this, where does anybody want to see VA's budget cut and these veterans [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1396.8s)]
*  who are coming back, they should get all the services in the world. And these hard discussions [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1403.12s)]
*  are now happening and it's not taboo. So the over 10 windows wide open now to discuss even [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1407.1999999999998s)]
*  the budget of the VA and where is the money going to come from? So I think we're actually going to [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1413.04s)]
*  make progress on it. This was like a sacred cow and now we're talking about it. To Bernie [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1417.1999999999998s)]
*  Sanders point, I don't know if you saw, there was a note on there, Nick, community notes pointed out [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1423.6799999999998s)]
*  that Trump put that none of the cuts should impact vets. And so I thought that was a good [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1428.24s)]
*  use of community notes there. The one comment I'll say about Bernie Sanders is when Russ vote, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1434.96s)]
*  who is the nominee to run OMB, went through his confirmation yesterday, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1440.88s)]
*  Sanders asked a similar question around Medicare and Medicaid. And what was interesting is Russ [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1448.08s)]
*  tried to actually answer the question and give the details around where there can be waste, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1453.6s)]
*  fraud and abuse. Sanders really didn't want to hear it. He just wanted a sound bite. So [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1459.4399999999998s)]
*  I think these confirmation processes are- Performative. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1465.1999999999998s)]
*  They're hugely performative. Yes. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1470.0s)]
*  I do think that, and this applies, I think, to both sides, Democrats as well when they are [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1473.04s)]
*  eventually in power. I think that when you're given a very clear mandate as a president, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1477.6s)]
*  I think you should be able to get to pick your team. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1483.0400000000002s)]
*  Because it's clear that the American people have voted an agenda. It's not like he hid that agenda. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1486.5600000000002s)]
*  And so the people that then want to implement that agenda should be put on the field. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1491.1200000000001s)]
*  It seems like the point of these should be if somebody could get compromised or there was [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1494.96s)]
*  something really gnarly in their background, but otherwise, let people build their team and then [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1499.44s)]
*  they have to own their results. Tell us about your feelings and [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1504.48s)]
*  takeaways about the weekend. Well, it's obviously mixed. I was an [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1508.5600000000002s)]
*  ever-Trump-er and now I am rooting for him wholeheartedly to do great work. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1511.36s)]
*  Be honest. You kind of like him. Come on. You do kind of like him. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1517.6s)]
*  Well, I mean, anybody who's interacted with Trump likes him- [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1520.8799999999999s)]
*  Before you go your diatribe, just say it. Just say you like him. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1524.6399999999999s)]
*  There are aspects I like about the platform. I like probably 80% of the platform. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1528.24s)]
*  You want to say it, but you- And I will tell you today that 20% I don't [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1531.6799999999998s)]
*  like. I'm always going to call balls and strike. No, no, no. I'm just saying you kind of like him. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1534.08s)]
*  Just say you kind of like him. You do like him. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1537.92s)]
*  I like 80% of his platform this time around. No, him. Him as a person. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1540.0s)]
*  You know, there's things I really don't like and I'll talk about them today, but [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1544.8000000000002s)]
*  the personal thing doesn't matter. What matters is what he does for the American people and for [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1550.0s)]
*  the country. Because you like him. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1553.52s)]
*  I know you can't say it yet, but deep down inside you like him. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1554.4s)]
*  You were happy to be there? I have to say, I had a lot of fun. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1556.88s)]
*  The Republicans are fun, no? The Republicans are fun. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1562.3200000000002s)]
*  I will say, the Republicans are fun. Fashion was off the hook. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1566.08s)]
*  Off the hook. A lot of great fashion and it was a great party. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1569.9199999999998s)]
*  Make America beautiful again. My gosh. I mean, listen- [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1572.1599999999999s)]
*  No more jogging pants and white fox. Get rid of it. Burn it to the ground. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1575.76s)]
*  What I'll say my takeaway was, as somebody who had concerns, and I'm not going to make [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1581.12s)]
*  the show about me, but the important thing for me is who is Trump going to lead with this time [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1586.08s)]
*  around? Is it going to be the people from the sort of 1.0 movement or the 2.0 movement? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1594.16s)]
*  There was not a 1.0 person- Couldn't be found. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1599.68s)]
*  Couldn't be found. Couldn't be found. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1603.0400000000002s)]
*  And so, like on the margin one or two, and they were not the focus. And who you put in the front [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1604.8000000000002s)]
*  row speaks volumes. Who did he put in the front row? Sundar, Elon, Zuck, Loren Sanchez. He's got [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1613.0400000000002s)]
*  his priorities straight in. The priorities were very clear as to what's important for this [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1620.8s)]
*  administration. And I'm fully behind all of his priorities, both of those priorities. All those [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1628.6399999999999s)]
*  priorities seem incredibly important to me. You're such a troll. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1635.2s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to troll too much, but that's the big takeaway for me. And if that is [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1640.24s)]
*  indicative of where he wants to go with this, which is business first, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1646.3999999999999s)]
*  we're proud of our leaders, we're proud of innovation. I think he's sticking it to it. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1650.0s)]
*  Did you see him at Davos today? He did a- I mean, this guy's got just crazy energy. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1654.32s)]
*  Who? Malay? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1660.8s)]
*  Trump zoomed into Davos and just dunked on them for 45 minutes. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1661.6s)]
*  He did? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1666.96s)]
*  Yes. And he just destroyed everybody at their dying conference, in their irrelevance, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1668.0s)]
*  as they genuflected begging him to come next year. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1676.32s)]
*  Did you see the photo of the half empty conference room? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1680.8s)]
*  Most of the events were just empty chairs. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1685.4399999999998s)]
*  It's irrelevant. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1689.28s)]
*  I mean, these people are irrelevant now. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1690.1599999999999s)]
*  Thomas, you guys remember when Davos used to be a really big deal. Is it dead? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1692.08s)]
*  I think it's worse, Chamath. I think it's a counter indicator now. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1696.32s)]
*  It is. And there was a good conversation yesterday, Graham Allison, who spoke at our summit, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1699.4399999999998s)]
*  was on this panel and they basically said, we lost, they won. Our group here at Davos lost, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1702.88s)]
*  it's over. And they're no longer to your point on the right side of history. They said, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1708.64s)]
*  we had a point of view on the future, we believe we were going in the right direction, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1714.48s)]
*  and everyone told us in this last couple of months that we were wrong. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1717.68s)]
*  The gentleman, by the way, that spoke after Graham Allison was also very good. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1722.0800000000002s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1726.3200000000002s)]
*  This is the greatest comeback in political history of a politician. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1727.2s)]
*  We need to also factor in not only who's won, which is Trump, but who's lost, which is to say us. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1731.52s)]
*  And then he has a whole, the guy has a whole long monologue on why they lost and what they lost, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1737.44s)]
*  which I think is pretty relevant that that, you know, kind of elite, if you will, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1742.32s)]
*  has been replaced with a populist vote and a populist leader. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1747.68s)]
*  All right, let's get to our docket today. And I just want to give a special thanks to [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1752.08s)]
*  our docket today. And just want to give a special shout out. We did our inauguration [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1757.52s)]
*  live stream and it was awesome and fun. Special thanks to Air Call, Abra, and Hims. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1762.72s)]
*  Thomas, if you've ever got an issue with weight or, you know, other issues that men have, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1771.52s)]
*  you can go to Hims and use the code ALLIN to get something. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1777.68s)]
*  Hims.com all in. I want you to write that down, Thomas. Okay. In case you ever have any issues. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1780.96s)]
*  What makes you think I haven't already? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1786.08s)]
*  Well, anything's possible. Like, I mean, maybe we could talk. I mean, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1788.1599999999999s)]
*  are you on the chews or the pills? Which one? Anyway, we'll talk about it off one. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1791.84s)]
*  But that's a full head of hair. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1795.84s)]
*  It is a really incredible head of hair. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1797.1999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. All natural, baby. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1799.84s)]
*  It's great. It's great. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1801.4399999999998s)]
*  What product do you put in? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1802.48s)]
*  Yeah. Do you put sea salt? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1803.6799999999998s)]
*  Or you got... [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1805.04s)]
*  Thomas, what do you do? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1805.6s)]
*  All in one. All in one. Praline. Shampoo plus conditioner. One bottle. Easy. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1807.12s)]
*  No, but you don't use any product afterwards? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1812.08s)]
*  None. Jesus Christ. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1815.12s)]
*  Do you blow yourself or do you have it blown? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1816.56s)]
*  It's a question... [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1819.6s)]
*  I do both, but in this case, it's, you know, like Cuba Gooding and Jerry Maguire. I air dry, baby. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1819.9199999999998s)]
*  Oh, air dry. Gotcha. So when you're driving to that Santa Monica office, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1825.9199999999998s)]
*  you just put the top down on whatever convertible, living that full lifestyle. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1830.08s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. This is where I do have to admit, unfortunately, after you appeared on the summit, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1834.08s)]
*  I had all these women, they were like, oh my God, Thomas LaFont is so good looking. And I was like, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1839.52s)]
*  no, he's not. Because I'm very competitive and zero sum when other men around me get good. But [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1844.4s)]
*  you were the smash hit. And then I figured out it must be the hair. And also the glasses. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1849.0400000000002s)]
*  I think the glasses were a huge hit. It looked very Clark Kentish. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1853.52s)]
*  Are they real glasses or you just wear the clear ones to get the actual intelligence points? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1856.64s)]
*  Only time I've ever been stopped in the street in my life, in the Presidio, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1860.88s)]
*  a very nice lady tapped me in the shoulder and said, I loved your all in talk. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1865.52s)]
*  It's never happened before. So that says more about all in than me. But [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1870.16s)]
*  the reach is increasing. It's a little bit too much. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1874.08s)]
*  Shout out to Akash Singh who joined us on the live. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1877.12s)]
*  Oh yes. Akash was hilarious. Thank you Akash filling in our DEI department. We lost Chamath [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1879.92s)]
*  and they sent Akash. So he did great. Get him back to guess us. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1888.08s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah. There's a moderator slot open. So he's going to be. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1892.08s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. If you know anybody who knows science, all right. In our first topic, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1894.72s)]
*  President Trump smashed the record for day one executive orders, 26 in all, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1900.0s)]
*  beating the prior record of nine by Uncle Joe Biden. No other president signed more than one [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1906.56s)]
*  EO in day one since the federal register started tracking this in 1937. Let's go through them. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1913.52s)]
*  If you want to comment on one, we'll stop and pause, or we can just run through them. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1920.16s)]
*  Gentlemen, Doge officially was established and people are making note of the Doge [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1923.36s)]
*  SWAT team. Doge will assign an agency head to each federal agency. The agency head will build [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1929.52s)]
*  a four person team. This will include an engineer and HR specialist and an attorney. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1935.36s)]
*  It was separately announced that Vivek was leaving Doge to run for governor of Ohio. Fascinating. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1941.28s)]
*  Interesting. I don't know if anyone's got to take there. They suspended the TikTok ban for 75 days. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1948.48s)]
*  There's a lot more to get into this. So we're going to break that down a little later. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1955.28s)]
*  Talk about TikTok. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1957.84s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. We'll go right to that in a minute. The January 6th pardons, they pardoned 1,500 [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1958.8799999999999s)]
*  January 6th participants, including some that savagely beat cops. Very controversial. We'll [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1964.0s)]
*  get back to that in a moment. Ending birthright citizenship. This is a controversial one that [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1970.48s)]
*  is being fought legally. Those born in the US to illegal immigrants would no longer be [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1975.6s)]
*  considered citizens. If this holds up, the birthright citizenship is codified in the 14th [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1980.8799999999999s)]
*  Amendment and 22 state attorney generals have already sued over this executive order. So it [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1986.48s)]
*  might be a performative one. Energy unleashing American energy. We're going to jump into that [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1992.72s)]
*  one for sure. And then federal employees, a hiring freeze and a full return to office. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=1998.0s)]
*  And the hiring freeze doesn't apply to military immigration enforcement or public safety. And then [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2004.24s)]
*  a regulatory freeze on regulations. Gentlemen, where do we want to start? Jan 6, TikTok, Doge. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2009.44s)]
*  Thomas, you're our guest. Where do you want to start? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2015.6s)]
*  I'm happy to chat about TikTok. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2017.36s)]
*  Okay. As we mentioned earlier, Trump extended TikTok's grace period by 75 days. Trump said he [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2019.1999999999998s)]
*  wants to get a deal done. He also said at a press conference that he'd like the US to own 50% of [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2025.6s)]
*  TikTok and that it could be a trillion dollar asset. That's unique and interesting. He was also [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2030.3999999999999s)]
*  positive about the idea of Elon possibly buying it or maybe Larry Ellison or anybody. So he wants [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2038.8799999999999s)]
*  to make a deal. What are your thoughts, Thomas, on what should happen with TikTok and what will [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2044.96s)]
*  happen? I don't know what will happen, but I do think it'd be interesting to share you guys. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2053.04s)]
*  We are investors in TikTok. We invested back, it was obviously just a Chinese company and [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2060.16s)]
*  investing in China was very different back then. But what resonated to me when I met the founder [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2065.92s)]
*  and he just had a very simple idea, which is his view was, if I have a piece of content and it's [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2071.12s)]
*  a great piece of content, how can I have it be shared? And his view was that if you shared on [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2077.68s)]
*  Instagram, the only way people see it is if you had a lot of followers. And so he just had a really [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2082.16s)]
*  simple idea and he said, what if I take every piece of content that's uploaded into the system [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2087.36s)]
*  and I showed to at least one other user? So no matter what that content is, at least one person [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2093.36s)]
*  will see it, even if you have no followers. And then based on whether that person views it or how [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2098.72s)]
*  long I might show it to another user and then a third and a fourth. And it was such a revolutionary [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2104.56s)]
*  idea and it really resonated with me at the time. And it just goes to show how we're in an idea [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2110.24s)]
*  business. And when you have a truly revolutionary idea, it can get really big. And so the whole [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2115.52s)]
*  genesis of TikTok came from that really simple concept of your content will be shown. And if [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2120.3999999999996s)]
*  people like it, it will be shown to a lot of people. So obviously, I mean, if you look at [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2126.48s)]
*  TikTok in the U S we can just kind of very back of the envelope, look at the math, right? So [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2131.2s)]
*  if we look at D a use mother blue or meta, as we love to know the Facebook hat roughly, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2138.32s)]
*  right? Has about 200 million D a use in the active users for folks who don't know the terminology. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2144.8s)]
*  Yeah, correct. Right. So if you look at Facebook, let's Instagram, you'll see it's about 200 million [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2152.16s)]
*  D a use. And you can look at the time spent. What's interesting about TikTok's time spent is the [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2157.12s)]
*  D a use are about half of combined meta and insta. So we get about a hundred million D a use in the [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2162.72s)]
*  U S but the time spent on the platform is the equivalent of Facebook plus Instagram. So obviously [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2169.04s)]
*  incredible, not just scale in terms of D a use, but also on time spent. So if we think about, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2178.08s)]
*  okay, well, what, what would that mean the business is worth? So if we look at meta today, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2184.08s)]
*  the market cap is roughly one and a half trillion. I think internet investors generally assume about [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2188.48s)]
*  roughly half the market cap is U S. So if we take the one and a half trillion, maybe that's 750 [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2195.2000000000003s)]
*  billion, right? Now we know that the time spent is equivalent, but the D a use are half. So maybe [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2202.08s)]
*  we cut the 750 in half, right? That would tell you that the max value would put, you know, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2207.2799999999997s)]
*  if you monetize the way meta does and ran it, the way Zuck does might be 375 billion for the U S [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2213.36s)]
*  asset alone. I think from that point, you know, you kind of start to apply a couple of discounts, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2219.36s)]
*  right? One is if that's my kind of long-term value, what kind of return would an investor want [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2225.04s)]
*  potentially to get to that 375? You know, is it 50%? So maybe you cut that by 50%. And then I think [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2232.24s)]
*  the devil would be in the details. What are exactly are you getting? Are you just getting users? Are [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2239.12s)]
*  you getting the algorithm? Are you getting data? Right? So maybe you also want to apply kind of a [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2243.2799999999997s)]
*  more kind of severe discount to that. But I think you put it all together, you know, is 100 billion [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2248.48s)]
*  a reasonable scenario? You know, I think the math proves it. And then could it be a trillion dollar [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2255.68s)]
*  asset the way Trump has mentioned? I mean, in a world where Facebook's one and a half, right? And [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2262.08s)]
*  the penetration of Tik Tok in the U S is 50% of what meta is. I don't think it's unrealistic. So [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2268.88s)]
*  let's see what happens. I don't have any particular insight on what will happen. But what I do know is [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2276.48s)]
*  that it's an incredibly valuable franchise. So let me ask you the obvious question. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2281.44s)]
*  People are looking at this and saying, well, you're going to take 50% of your shares. And in this case, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2287.2799999999997s)]
*  we actually have somebody who has shares. So are you comfortable with the government seizing 50% [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2294.24s)]
*  of your shares, I guess, is one way to frame it? Well, I don't know. I mean, first of all, there's [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2298.4s)]
*  kind of no deal. So it's a little bit hard. I can tell you that when we all he proposed. So if in [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2304.7999999999997s)]
*  that scenario, would you? Yeah, we never attributed much value to the, you know, the Tik Tok U S asset [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2309.2s)]
*  in the sense of our analysis was always based on the value of the Chinese business, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2316.56s)]
*  specifically because it's just hard to know what the, you know, the Tik Tok asset X China would be [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2321.52s)]
*  worth, right? Is it worth zero? Because it's so compromised regulatorily. Is it worth a lot more? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2327.44s)]
*  It's just very, very difficult to know. So we always took a very kind of conservative view [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2333.68s)]
*  of really looking at kind of the Chinese and, you know, some of the other assets as the core [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2339.68s)]
*  value of ByteDance, the holding company. Ultimately, what Tik Tok happens, I mean, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2344.16s)]
*  it's the classic when you try and sell a company, what's the value where it depends, is there one [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2349.7599999999998s)]
*  bidder or five bidders? Right? Is the government the only bidder for that asset? In that case, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2353.52s)]
*  it kind of will indicate a value of X or are there other companies that potentially could be [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2359.6s)]
*  an acceptable bidder to both sides? Well, the Trump deal, though, is he saying the government, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2364.64s)]
*  the United States government, the citizens of America, we get half of the company. So [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2370.64s)]
*  that would be the equivalent of you giving half your shares. The U.S. company. Yeah. So [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2374.88s)]
*  what do you think of this proposal? Because this seems like unique in all the world. So if in order [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2378.96s)]
*  to have it spin out and maintain half your shares, would you be willing to give all of us, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2387.2s)]
*  the government, the citizens of the United States, half your shares? Well, I mean, if you think about [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2391.9199999999996s)]
*  it, what did we learn a couple days ago? We learned that it might just get shut down and be worth zero. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2396.24s)]
*  Right. So in one sense, anything that's greater than zero, by definition, is kind of better. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2402.72s)]
*  Right. I think ultimately it will kind of come down to does the government want to be the only [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2409.4399999999996s)]
*  bidder for the asset or would the government be comfortable with either Elon owning it [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2415.04s)]
*  and merging it to X or Microsoft owning it or, you know, what have you? Well, Thomas, let me [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2420.56s)]
*  ask you a question. Can you just tell the audience a little bit about because you guys have been [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2427.6s)]
*  involved as investors in China for a long time. I would love for you to share behind the scenes [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2432.16s)]
*  what has gone on with respect to being an investor in China in technology over the last couple of [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2438.64s)]
*  years. What has changed and why and what goes on today? You guys made a fantastic investment [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2445.36s)]
*  in ByteDance, which is the parent company of TikTok. You've made other incredible investments [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2451.44s)]
*  in China. Are you still investing in China? If not, walk us through what happened and why. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2455.6s)]
*  I think if you look, David, most of our, virtually all of our investments in China were Chinese [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2461.52s)]
*  companies catering to the Chinese market. Right. Right. And there was a massive trend of [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2467.6s)]
*  a very significant economy that was adopting technology. Right. And so we can think about [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2474.08s)]
*  whether that be smartphones, companies like, you know, Huawei, whether it was companies like [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2478.96s)]
*  Maituan that were doing food delivery or Tencent that were doing gaming. And so, you know, all our [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2485.6s)]
*  approach was basically based on these companies. And by the way, a lot of them were public, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2492.08s)]
*  which is what people don't remember. Chamath, you may remember, but Tencent at one point was [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2496.88s)]
*  a public company listed in Hong Kong. The market cap was 200 million. Yeah, I do remember. So, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2501.6s)]
*  wow. What was interesting about it, Dave, is a lot of that played out. Baidu was an early IPO. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2506.56s)]
*  Right. So a lot of that trend of Chinese companies catering to the Chinese market [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2512.8s)]
*  really kind of played out across public and private markets for over 20 years. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2518.48s)]
*  Yep. I think to me, what significantly changed over the past five years is technology really [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2522.88s)]
*  became a matter of national security. And I don't think that when we were early investors in Maituan, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2531.2000000000003s)]
*  right, that we necessarily viewed that as a national security threat, as an example. Right. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2537.6800000000003s)]
*  And I think as. You know, companies got bigger as AI kind of came to be, it became pretty obvious [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2543.2000000000003s)]
*  that there were national security implications. And, you know, our view as investors is we don't [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2550.64s)]
*  set the rules of the road. We rely on government and regulators to do so. It was pretty clear, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2555.68s)]
*  I think, to obvious that the regulatory regimes were changing in both countries. And so for us, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2560.24s)]
*  as investors, you know, we were just, well, we're just going to follow what the rules are and what [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2565.04s)]
*  the governments are. So my only kind of regret through this whole thing is, and I don't know any, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2569.2799999999997s)]
*  you know, if you guys had kind of some exposure to this, but the quality of the entrepreneurs [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2576.08s)]
*  that came out of that era was unbelievable. That's a strong cohort. Absolutely. When you think about [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2580.4s)]
*  the founder of Maituan, Wang She, and just how brilliant he was and what he's done with that [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2587.68s)]
*  franchise and not just doing food delivery, but also the software operating system for restaurants. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2592.96s)]
*  Right. It's truly incredible. Pony Ma from Tencent. Right. It was such an incredible group of [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2597.7599999999998s)]
*  entrepreneurs. They were a lot of fun to be around. They were excited and passionate about [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2604.88s)]
*  bringing technology to their country. And, you know, I, is it over? Yeah. Hard to know. I mean, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2609.6800000000003s)]
*  if you look at the capital markets, I mean, you can see, we've not seen a tremendous amount of [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2617.52s)]
*  innovation, right? Or new companies kind of coming out. So I think the key question is, you know, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2621.36s)]
*  is it a pendulum and, you know, does the Chinese regulatory regime kind of move one way and then [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2626.96s)]
*  it kind of moves another way? Or is it kind of fixed in this state? Is it your read, is it correct [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2631.92s)]
*  to say that the CCP wanted to stop this extraordinary wealth creation by a subset of individuals in the [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2638.32s)]
*  country that this was kind of becoming too much of a capitalist enterprising system and challenge [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2647.36s)]
*  some of the foundations of the CCP? Is that what was going on and why this all got throttled back? [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2653.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, is there, or is there something else, some other kind of, you know, security reason? [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2659.6s)]
*  I don't really know, Dave, because as an investor, it's, you know, it's not a regulatory regime that [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2664.64s)]
*  you have any interaction with, right? You're really talking to the entrepreneurs and you're [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2669.44s)]
*  kind of reflecting off of their energy and their business ideas, right? So we would meet businesses [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2673.2s)]
*  and we would meet founders. And if the idea was kind of interesting to us, we would kind of fund [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2679.12s)]
*  it, right? So it's a black box in some ways, you know, in terms of a market to invest in, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2683.68s)]
*  you only have a limited amount of information. And after Jack, I mean, you got to think after Jack Ma [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2688.3199999999997s)]
*  kind of disappeared for a couple of years, if you're an entrepreneur and you want to like, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2695.2799999999997s)]
*  the message was sent, the message was sent, message received. And then you start thinking [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2699.7599999999998s)]
*  about Shamoff, you know, what Trump just did and what Xi Jinping just did. You put those two things [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2704.3199999999997s)]
*  together. Trump put all of our top guys, top dogs on stage. Here they are. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2710.16s)]
*  It's the exact opposite of China. The message is very clear. And it's what Thomas said, like [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2714.56s)]
*  technology is a national security imperative. And so we're going to embrace these guys. We're [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2720.0s)]
*  not going to play favorites. We're not going to pick one and not the other. We're not going to [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2725.3599999999997s)]
*  have summits and have, you know, the founder of an entire category, not be invited. That's just, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2729.12s)]
*  it's honestly, it's patently stupid and immature. And that's what the Biden administration did. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2735.04s)]
*  Picked favorites. Yeah. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2740.48s)]
*  And that is dumb based on the implication and importance of technology. I just want to go back [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2741.92s)]
*  to the TikTok thing. I want to make three points. One is from the past. I'll give you [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2747.04s)]
*  my sense of the TikTok thing and I'm going to make a prediction for the future. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2752.88s)]
*  In 1984, the way that LVMH began was through a deal that Bernard Arnault architected. There was a [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2756.24s)]
*  business owned by the French cotton king, Marcel Boussac, and inside of that empire was Christian [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2767.7599999999998s)]
*  Dior. Long story short, his empire was crumbling and Arnault did a deal where he bought [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2774.56s)]
*  that dying business essentially from the French government for one franc. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2782.16s)]
*  Fast forward now 40 years of very hard work and tremendous execution. That's a $350 billion [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2786.96s)]
*  public company. Now imagine back then in 1984, if the French government actually had done a deal [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2793.7599999999998s)]
*  where they said, we'll sell it to you for 50% of whatever you build, take it for a dollar, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2802.24s)]
*  but we're going to own 50% of the upside. And they would have an extra $175 billion today. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2807.2s)]
*  I think that that's very important in terms of what is possible today. I like Thomas's math. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2815.3599999999997s)]
*  I believe it. I do think it's about a $100 billion asset, but at the end of the day, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2822.24s)]
*  the president was very clear that it is completely and entirely worthless without his permit. And he [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2828.08s)]
*  wants to own 50% of this asset. Now, if you're a buyer of something, you're not going to pay [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2834.64s)]
*  $100 billion if you control whether it can exist or not. You're basically going to pay today's [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2840.4s)]
*  equivalent of one franc, which would be $1. Now I'm not saying that it is going to be a dollar, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2846.0s)]
*  but if the United States Treasury wants to hold 50% of an asset, that could be worth $100 billion [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2852.48s)]
*  or $500 billion or maybe a trillion. It would make sense for the United States Treasury and [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2859.12s)]
*  the United States people to own that at effectively zero. So I think that the incentive is there. And [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2865.12s)]
*  I think he has essentially said that he is going to do the best deal in his interests, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2871.52s)]
*  which is the United States interests, which I suspect means a price that is as low as possible, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2876.56s)]
*  approaching $1. And ultimately, won't this be Chinese government's decision? Because they [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2883.68s)]
*  could always say, you know what, let it die. Maybe. But my point is, it may not be a dollar. Maybe it [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2890.3999999999996s)]
*  could be $25 billion. Maybe it could be $10 billion. But my point is, I find it very hard to see how it [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2895.3599999999997s)]
*  gets to the actual value that it is today. So then I think, let me just make a prediction for the [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2900.3199999999997s)]
*  future. There's a question that this raises, which is, does it make sense for the American government [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2906.64s)]
*  to be a little bit smarter going forward about how it allocates incentives and resources? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2914.08s)]
*  The American government is still the largest single landowner in America. We give concessions [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2920.0s)]
*  to private companies to drill, to build things. And it just turns out that if you apply this [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2926.3999999999996s)]
*  example more broadly, wouldn't it make sense where when you create incredible economic incentives and [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2932.7999999999997s)]
*  upside for private investors and investment, for some portion of that gain to go back to the [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2938.8s)]
*  American people? Is that a bad thing? I don't think so. For example, if you said we're going [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2944.0800000000004s)]
*  to accelerate permitting for all these data centers, we're going to make any form of energy, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2949.6000000000004s)]
*  which was the opposite of what the Biden EO said on his way out the door. He had all these conditions. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2954.48s)]
*  But if the President Trump's EO on data center says any kind of energy, but we want to own a 5% [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2960.0s)]
*  royalty and we'll allow you to put it on federal lands for 10% or 15%, would it really change the [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2966.48s)]
*  underwriting that Blackstone and all these other companies will do? I don't think so. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2972.96s)]
*  Would it enrich America? I think so. Would it make it easier for people to feel like they're [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2977.28s)]
*  participating in all of these incredible gains? I also think so. So my prediction is that this [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2982.72s)]
*  becomes more of a template for the future. It'll be less about permitting. It'll be more about [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2989.76s)]
*  creating incentives and allocating those incentives for a share of the upside. I think that there [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=2995.36s)]
*  is a really strong economic argument for America to do that. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3001.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, Trimoth, to build on that, people don't remember, but Tesla got $465 million from the [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3006.96s)]
*  Department of Energy. That was called the ATVM program, which was the Advanced Technology [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3012.2400000000002s)]
*  Vehicles Manufacturing. That was a very visionary program at the time. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3017.44s)]
*  Visionary. But it took no equity. But it didn't take equity. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3021.2s)]
*  That was dumb. So dumb. They should have gotten some portion of equity, some portion of a loan. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3026.3199999999997s)]
*  Tesla did so well, thanks to Elon and the team's hard work, that they paid it back early. They [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3033.2799999999997s)]
*  paid it back early. That's how well they did. If they had owned 10% of Tesla, but 10%? [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3038.48s)]
*  Yeah. I think the president has sniffed this out, by the way. And you may not think that these are [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3044.3199999999997s)]
*  related, but when he said that he's considering eliminating federal income tax and funding this [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3049.68s)]
*  thing from tariffs, and he just had a press conference today where he's inviting every [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3054.8799999999997s)]
*  single company to come and make things in the United States because he will create economic [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3060.16s)]
*  incentives to make it here cheaper. But if you make it abroad and bring it in here, he's going [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3063.8399999999997s)]
*  to charge money and a tariff. All of this are part and parcel of, I think, this broader economic [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3068.56s)]
*  realization. And unlike 2008, nine and 10, when we were allocating money, or 2020 and 21 and 22, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3074.16s)]
*  where we were just sending money out the door with, frankly, no consequence and no accounting, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3082.24s)]
*  this time around, I think he's got some incredibly sharp business people. This is, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3089.6s)]
*  by the way, the upside of having folks that have actually been successful in the real world [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3093.2s)]
*  working inside of government, is they're going to help him get to this realization. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3098.16s)]
*  And I think it's a really good one. I don't think Tim. Tim Walton, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3102.08s)]
*  when I went back to Chamath on that would be, I just think it's a dangerous game for the [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3104.64s)]
*  government to start picking winners. You know, I wouldn't, for example, if it owns 50% of a TikTok, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3110.64s)]
*  does does it disadvantage a meta as an example? Right. And I do wonder, is the value capturing [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3116.72s)]
*  mechanism for the government taxes essentially? Right. So the way you capture the right, the [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3122.56s)]
*  portion of the value creation of these companies is through a tax system. And I do think we just [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3129.12s)]
*  have to be careful of the government all of a sudden picking different companies to win. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3133.7599999999998s)]
*  I do think having a good set of incentives, a level playing field, let the competitive dynamics [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3138.72s)]
*  of different companies fight each other, and then capture the value through taxes. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3143.6s)]
*  I think you're right. And I think that that part is absolutely fundamental. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3147.7599999999998s)]
*  But I think there is a way to architect this. For example, you have these RFPs that by design, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3152.72s)]
*  have to be published in the open source and available for anybody to bid on. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3159.44s)]
*  My only point is just to say that when there is an ultimate winner, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3163.04s)]
*  why not have a small stake in the upside? Look at the amount of money that the DOE [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3167.2799999999997s)]
*  gives in grants. I'll give you an example. You know, one of these companies that I helped start [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3172.24s)]
*  a few years ago to make advanced battery materials, we got $150 million grant. I'm [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3176.7999999999997s)]
*  very appreciative of that grant. But if they also asked for five or 10% of the equity, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3181.2799999999997s)]
*  I would have still said yes. Of course you would have. Yeah, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3186.0s)]
*  it's a great deal. And why not give a little upside to the taxpayers? I agree with that. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3188.4s)]
*  By the way, a parallel to that would be spectrum, right? If you think about wireless, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3192.16s)]
*  right? Kind of got built, the government auctioned off spectrum and then allowed public, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3196.56s)]
*  you know, private companies to kind of come and bid on it. And, you know, so there's a lot of [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3201.12s)]
*  different interesting mechanisms you can bring to that. Yeah. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3205.52s)]
*  Freeburg, which EO would you like to go to next? Well, I'll just wrap on the TikTok. Sure. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3208.48s)]
*  I do worry a lot about the precedent being set here with respect to foreign government actions [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3214.3199999999997s)]
*  on US companies in their local countries. Imagine the CCP tells Tesla they have to sell [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3222.8799999999997s)]
*  their Chinese operations and give 50% of the Chinese operations to the Chinese government [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3231.4399999999996s)]
*  because of their concerns about security, where Tesla is now able to track Chinese citizens [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3238.0s)]
*  driving around and where they are. And you can see very quickly how this whole kind of overall, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3243.36s)]
*  I think, presentation of the security risk that we face with TikTok and therefore we will shut it [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3249.2000000000003s)]
*  down or own it creates, I think, a counter that could really hurt American companies. You could [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3255.6s)]
*  see this going to Google, to Apple, to Tesla, even food manufacturing companies that have operations [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3261.6s)]
*  overseas where local governments say, hey, we need to, for local security purposes, we need to [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3267.92s)]
*  take ownership of your business. I think one of the things that's really benefited Americans in [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3273.44s)]
*  global trade is our ability to sell and export our technology, our goods and our services around the [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3278.32s)]
*  world through open trade. And I do think that we've used this kind of TikTok security thing to say [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3283.44s)]
*  this is a rationale for us doing this as a one-off, but it also opens up a lot of other people to say [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3290.2400000000002s)]
*  this is a one-off. And so I'm just generally very wary about this whole TikTok situation, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3295.12s)]
*  opening up a can of worms. You're 100% right. And by the way, the CCP has done it already. They [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3299.52s)]
*  did it to Apple. And if you follow what happened when they introduced iCloud, I don't know if you [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3304.48s)]
*  remember GCBD, GCBD is the Chinese state-owned data company, the cloud provider there. And they [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3310.3199999999997s)]
*  just told Apple, we get all the data. And they just had to roll over and all citizens in China [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3318.4s)]
*  who use an iPhone in order to use an iPhone in China, your data is owned by the government, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3325.76s)]
*  period, full stop. And Apple had no choice but to do that. So if you want to play in a certain [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3330.4s)]
*  market, you got to play by the rules. The thing to keep in mind here is I hear all of these kind [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3335.84s)]
*  of like theoretical qualms about how it's unfair, but this stuff happens all the time. And it's just [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3340.56s)]
*  that we don't benefit from it. So Jason brought up an excellent example of Tesla. The other example, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3345.68s)]
*  just to remind you guys is during the pandemic, the Federal Reserve stepped in and started buying [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3350.8799999999997s)]
*  commercial corporate bonds. They own a ton of like four bonds so that these things wouldn't [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3355.8399999999997s)]
*  default. There's all kinds of action all the time where the federal government is involved in private [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3360.72s)]
*  companies. My point is if you're going to be involved, have some legacy ownership on the back [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3366.96s)]
*  end of it so that in case this stuff really works, that it's broadly value creating for more [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3372.32s)]
*  Americans. I think it would create a way to deescalate the sensation that a few people [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3379.28s)]
*  are winning and everybody else is just kind of staying still. We should talk about Stargate [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3386.7200000000003s)]
*  and the AI project because I do think it tees off on one of the most... I want to talk about [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3391.84s)]
*  Jan 6th though. Okay. But it does tee off of one of the other kind of key [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3396.08s)]
*  things that I heard a lot about in DC. And I know Thomas is passionate about, like I am, which is [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3401.36s)]
*  energy, electricity capacity build out in the United States because it's critical. Like building AI [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3405.36s)]
*  infrastructure means that we need to build energy infrastructure. All right. And so anyway, let's... [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3411.52s)]
*  Yeah. We'll go right to that after we wrap up these executive orders. And I, too, wanted to [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3416.4s)]
*  talk about January 6th. Just to give people the update here, JD Vance had said that the people [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3422.08s)]
*  who committed violence on January 6th, quote, obviously shouldn't be pardoned. And this is a [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3427.36s)]
*  parade of people who are on the Republican side, who are coming out against how President Trump [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3434.72s)]
*  handled this. I think you all know where I would fall on this side of it. Where are your thoughts [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3440.7999999999997s)]
*  on this? Where do you fall on him? You know, I come from a family of cops and I feel like he's [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3445.04s)]
*  betrayed the blue on this one. And, you know, if there are people who I think he should have taken [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3449.76s)]
*  his time with this, it is possible that some people had sentences that were too long. The justice system [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3454.88s)]
*  is imperfect in our country and the pardon power is theirs, I think specifically, to do a very [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3462.7200000000003s)]
*  granular job of looking at each case. Right. And so I think we have to look at pardon power generally [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3468.4s)]
*  after what we saw the Biden family do. And now we see Trump doing this. So I think the pardon power [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3474.4s)]
*  is not being used as it's intended. It's being used politically now by both parties. So I'm trying [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3479.36s)]
*  to call balls and strikes here. But you know, as somebody who's in law enforcement, a family that's [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3486.48s)]
*  in law enforcement, and my chosen career was to be a cop and an FBI agent. And, you know, just looking [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3490.8s)]
*  at it, it's just heartbreaking to see people beat cops and then be treated as heroes. And some of [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3496.7200000000003s)]
*  these people are very dark people. You know, the oath keepers and some of these people are extremely [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3502.96s)]
*  violent. And they're coming out now after this has all been said and saying that they're going [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3507.2s)]
*  to double down, they're going to buy more guns and that they're going to get their retribution. And so [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3511.7599999999998s)]
*  I think you have to be really careful with violent people that you give them, you know, this coronation [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3515.9199999999996s)]
*  and that they were justified because they'll go do more violent things. And so I understand he made [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3521.68s)]
*  this promise to people. I think he should have been very granular in doing this. I totally understand [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3527.4399999999996s)]
*  there could be people who got sentences that were too long. And I would have liked to see him do this [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3534.0s)]
*  thoughtfully. This was not done thoughtfully. I have a certain amount of goodwill towards the [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3538.56s)]
*  new president and this has lowered it. I knew that this would be really important to you. So I took a [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3543.04s)]
*  few minutes to try to collect my thoughts. I've been kind of walking myself through it since [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3548.88s)]
*  yesterday. This is not an explanation other than to you, Jason, my friend about how I think we got [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3554.88s)]
*  here. Okay. So I just wanted to take a few minutes to explain that to you. I think that before you [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3563.52s)]
*  can look at January 6th, I think you've got to go back to what happened during the COVID lockdowns [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3568.88s)]
*  and what we started to see in a bunch of these liberal cities. Talking about BLM riots? The BLM [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3576.72s)]
*  riots, the Antifa riots, what happened in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3585.12s)]
*  the lawlessness that you see in places like New York, the decarceration movement. And I think [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3592.7200000000003s)]
*  that what started to happen was a sensation that for the same weight, there were different measures. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3598.88s)]
*  So for example, if you start to look at some of the deportations that are happening now, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3611.44s)]
*  it's really quite shocking. I sent Nick a clip of them. Nick, you can just maybe show the first [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3618.16s)]
*  few seconds, but you are talking about some incredibly, incredibly violent offenders that [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3623.28s)]
*  were just walking randomly down the street. I'm not going back to Haiti. One of those threats [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3628.56s)]
*  is this illegal alien from Haiti. ICE says he's a gang member with 17 criminal convictions [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3633.36s)]
*  in recent years. You feel me? Yo, Biden forever, bro. Thank Obama for everything that he said for [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3639.68s)]
*  me. There's more after this, but there was like a rapist that they picked up in Boston. There's [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3646.8s)]
*  a person that was charged with assault. So there was this sensation, Jason, that was building up [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3650.2400000000002s)]
*  for a long time that all of a sudden the law was being applied in very odd ways, where depending [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3656.6400000000003s)]
*  on what you did, you would get adjudicated in totally different ways based on your political [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3663.28s)]
*  affiliation or your leaning or based on the desire of a district prosecutor to go after one thing or [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3669.28s)]
*  another. Let me just pause. So that's sort of like the thing that was sort of building and cascading. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3676.24s)]
*  I do agree with you that I think January 6th is kind of like a stain. I think there's nothing to [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3682.0s)]
*  be proud of there. But I think what we found out since January 6th is somewhat important. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3686.64s)]
*  I think the first thing we found out was that there was a bunch of these folks [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3692.64s)]
*  whose convictions were very speculative. I think the Supreme Court already ruled that in June of [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3696.3999999999996s)]
*  last year, it was like a 63 vote that said at least 350 of these convictions should probably [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3701.68s)]
*  just be thrown out. So there was one body that was that. Then there was a whole bunch of them [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3706.8799999999997s)]
*  where to your point, you took a misdemeanor, you trumped it up to a felony. You had all kinds of [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3712.08s)]
*  things where procedural motions were denied for the defense, approved for prosecution, and [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3718.72s)]
*  you had sentences that didn't match the crime. And then you have a president who, frankly, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3724.8799999999997s)]
*  was the subject of lawfare himself. So I think that what would have been better was a more [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3729.36s)]
*  methodical approach to this. I agree with you. But I do think that what's happening here is [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3734.88s)]
*  essentially a moment where we can close this entire chapter and we can get back to a focus on [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3739.6s)]
*  observing the law and adjudicating it equally for everybody. And I think that that's probably [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3747.04s)]
*  the best way that we can all deal with this because I think that there was a bunch of [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3752.56s)]
*  pardons that were 100% obvious. And then there was a bunch that were just, you know, had to be done [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3756.72s)]
*  because the court was perverted in how they dealt with some of these folks. Then there was a small [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3762.7999999999997s)]
*  number, and I don't know the exact number to be fair, Jason, where these folks did some really [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3769.6s)]
*  bad stuff. Now it's also mixed in with this thing where there was a bunch of informants. Then there [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3774.0s)]
*  was a bunch of folks that were paid. Super complicated. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3778.48s)]
*  Yeah, the informants stuff that you do. We'll have to wait for that to come out because that's [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3781.2799999999997s)]
*  in conspiracy for now. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3784.56s)]
*  My point is I just went and I collected that as a way to try to explain to you how we- [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3785.76s)]
*  Well, I appreciate you understanding my passion on it and wanting to bring it up. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3789.6800000000003s)]
*  How we got here. I think it's sort of like- [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3792.88s)]
*  I'm well aware of it, yeah. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3794.88s)]
*  I think we got to put a pin in this and say both sides should now have enough experience to say, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3796.08s)]
*  we're going to apply the law equally to everybody going forward from this moment out. Let's just go [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3803.6800000000003s)]
*  forward and not look back. I think that's the best thing that we can all do. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3807.6s)]
*  Let's hope. I'll just leave you with this. The Proud Boy leader, Enrique [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3811.2799999999997s)]
*  Tarrio, this is his quote on getting out. I'm happy the president's focusing not on retribution [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3816.3199999999997s)]
*  and focusing on success, but I will tell you that I'm not going to play by those rules. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3821.8399999999997s)]
*  They need to pay for what they did. These are some seriously bad hombres, the Proud Boys and [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3826.3999999999996s)]
*  the Oath Keepers. Don't be surprised if they do something worse. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3831.3599999999997s)]
*  I also want to talk about the citizenship thing, and I just want to just provide a little color [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3835.44s)]
*  for people. I'm sure that there's a lot of folks that are listening who have [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3841.52s)]
*  people that work for them that maybe- [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3845.2000000000003s)]
*  The birthright thing. If you came here illegally and had a child, you get to be a citizen, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3848.56s)]
*  just to be clear. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3853.12s)]
*  This is going to the Supreme Court. Just to put a little bit of color on it, in the 14th Amendment, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3854.08s)]
*  there's this very important part that says birthright citizenship is applied to people who are [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3858.48s)]
*  subject to the jurisdiction of America. For a long time, that phrase was not really considered [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3863.68s)]
*  in how the Supreme Court administered the 14th Amendment. I think what this EO did and the [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3871.7599999999998s)]
*  lawsuits that happened almost instantaneously as a result will now send this back to the Supreme [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3877.9199999999996s)]
*  Court very quickly, and people will opine on what that means. If it means nothing, it means that if [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3883.9199999999996s)]
*  you are here, however you're here, and if you have a child, they're going to be a citizen of America. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3891.12s)]
*  If that qualifier is now part of the administration and the interpretation of the 14th Amendment, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3896.96s)]
*  I think what President Trump has written is what will happen, which is if you are here illegally, [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3904.48s)]
*  it doesn't apply. If you are here under a visa that necessarily means you're still subject to [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3909.6s)]
*  the jurisdiction of somebody else, it may not apply. But I think the Supreme Court is going [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3915.44s)]
*  to get to decide this in pretty short order. Okay. A couple more issues I want to get to [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3919.6s)]
*  on the docket. Sorry. Let me just make a quick comment on the- Oh, sure, Dave. Go ahead. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3923.52s)]
*  The January 6th. I just generally don't like this power of pardon. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3928.4s)]
*  Agreed. We saw what Biden did. He gave, I mean, how many thousands, Nick? You can pull the number [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3934.88s)]
*  up, but 8,000 pardons. I feel like the original intention of the power of pardon, which is in the [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3941.28s)]
*  Constitution, was meant to protect the Union, the civility in the Union at times of we need to come [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3951.0400000000004s)]
*  back together and realign ourselves. It has been so far abused beyond that original intention. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3960.6400000000003s)]
*  It almost feels like an extraordinary injustice. It almost gives the president the ability [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3968.8799999999997s)]
*  to rewrite the law that many of the actions from the executive branch can simply supersede the [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3974.7999999999997s)]
*  actions of the judicial branch, which is really meant to protect and execute the laws of the [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3981.2799999999997s)]
*  nation. I think it's gone too far. It feels like there's a necessary amendment to address this, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3985.8399999999997s)]
*  that these presidents can come out and preemptively pardon people for things that might be found in [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3993.2799999999997s)]
*  the future because they're close with them. It has nothing to do with the original intention. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=3997.76s)]
*  If you go back to the arguments for the pardon being in the Constitution, [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4002.7200000000003s)]
*  you can see that Alexander Hamilton wrote deeply about it in Federalist paper number 74. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4008.0s)]
*  In that paper, he talked a lot about and emphasized that the justice system, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4014.5600000000004s)]
*  which is designed to be fair, may occasionally result in overly harsh or unjust outcomes. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4018.2400000000002s)]
*  And the pardon allows for acts of mercy to correct these situations. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4023.4399999999996s)]
*  A lot of these sorts of actions that we saw happen with Biden do not fit the bill for that [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4028.3999999999996s)]
*  definition. I will tell you there's a quote from Federalist paper 74 from Hamilton. It goes as [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4033.52s)]
*  follows, in seasons of insurrection or rebellion, there are often critical moments when a well-timed [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4039.3599999999997s)]
*  offer of pardon to the insurgents or rebels may restore the tranquility of the commonwealth. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4045.52s)]
*  So to counter my point, Hamilton's argument is that when the nation is divided, the act of the [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4052.32s)]
*  pardon may actually help bring the nation back together, as may have been the case with respect [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4058.8s)]
*  to the January 6th. But it may not necessarily be about justice. And it may not necessarily be [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4063.6s)]
*  about justice, but it's much more about restoring tranquility of the union and allowing the nation [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4069.92s)]
*  to move forward, even though it may not seem just, it may be the right thing for the nation. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4074.4s)]
*  So I'm not trying to defend the action or defend the pardon. I really don't like the act of pardoning [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4078.96s)]
*  as a kind of tool that's being used in a hundred different ways. And it certainly seems like it [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4084.16s)]
*  requires change. So yeah. And just programming note here, research note, 6,500 people of those 8,000 [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4088.48s)]
*  seem to be convicted of marijuana possession, possession, or distribution. And they were [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4096.32s)]
*  pardoned. Then the law should have been changed and the courts should have overturned all of [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4102.08s)]
*  those convictions. It does not necessarily need to fall and it shouldn't fall on the executive [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4107.04s)]
*  branch to take that action. The courts need to do their job and the legislators need to do their job. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4111.44s)]
*  . I don't disagree, but I think there is some compassion in the pardon concept [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4115.68s)]
*  for how long do they have to wait for that. Yeah. I mean, how long do you have to wait for that? [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4122.88s)]
*  And then like the people who were convicted of selling dime bags or having an ounce of weed on [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4126.8s)]
*  them were black and brown. And then all my white friends who started weed companies are now taking [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4131.84s)]
*  them public in Canada. So shout out Trudeau. All right. Let's keep moving here. I think we've, [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4137.28s)]
*  we did some good job here on the reconciliation on the pod. Where do we want to go next? Stargate [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4142.4800000000005s)]
*  project. Stargate. Stargate. Stargate and energy. Yeah. Stargate and energy. Stargate. Stargate. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4147.12s)]
*  So here we go. And I'm going to go to our guest here, Thomas. Thomas, anything on January 6 or [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4153.6s)]
*  controversial topics like smoking weed that you want to jump in on there? No. Okay. Great. Sure. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4159.6s)]
*  Your LPs just breathe. Hey, you're coming on the all in podcast. When his LPs, they're going to be [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4164.64s)]
*  so happy. But then when they hear the J six, they're just going to be clenched waiting for the [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4171.6s)]
*  Oh, wait, hold on. My mic went out. Oh, nevermind. I missed it. Okay. All right. I was well said, [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4178.08s)]
*  honestly. I don't have anything to add you guys. You guys, something to that. Anything on Lawrence [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4183.52s)]
*  Sanchez's outfit. Okay, let's continue. Another big story from week one, we are literally not even [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4187.2s)]
*  three or four days into this. It's going to be a crazy four years. According to open AI, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4197.36s)]
*  AI's press release, the Stargate project is a new company, which intends to invest 500 billion over [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4201.76s)]
*  the next four years, building new AI infrastructure for open AI in the United States. Freebird, we [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4208.4s)]
*  got to find out what's going on here with the Stargate movie and TV series. If they got IP [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4214.16s)]
*  permission to do this, soft bank and open AI are the questions. I mean, I'm just thinking out loud, [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4218.24s)]
*  and we have to talk about where this ranks on your list of great side and top 40, top 40, [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4224.8s)]
*  sci fi. Okay, that's right up there with the Star Trek original series and the next generation. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4231.76s)]
*  Soft bank and open AI are the lead partners with Oracle and MJX also participating Oracle, [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4238.08s)]
*  Nvidia and open AI will build and operate the infrastructure. Microsoft is sort of involved, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4242.72s)]
*  although we'll see about that. Mosh's Yoshi-san was at the announcement. He's going to be the [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4247.6s)]
*  chairman. However, Gavin Baker and Elon both called cap on X saying they don't actually have [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4251.92s)]
*  the money. Gavin did some back of the envelope math. And of course, as always, Sam and Elon have [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4258.4800000000005s)]
*  been spicy in the replies. Sam is hurt. Elon is dunking. It's just their relationship is so fluid. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4264.8s)]
*  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella jumped into my thread with Elon saying he was good for the 80 bill, [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4273.360000000001s)]
*  and then he was ready to build other products and services. And that was what was important. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4280.4800000000005s)]
*  What do you think here, Thomas? Is this a, are you an investor in open AI? I guess let's get that out [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4286.56s)]
*  there or in X AI, just so we know where you're coming from here. If you're talking your book, [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4290.88s)]
*  but, uh, I am an investor in open AI and, uh, okay. So there's three points I want to make here. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4296.320000000001s)]
*  Go point number one, going back to the origins of the pot of this podcast and, you know, sitting, [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4302.08s)]
*  watching both public market investors and venture investors. You know, one notable difference is, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4308.24s)]
*  you know, I think venture investors tend to be very tribal. So if you're in one tribe, you are [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4313.76s)]
*  by definition, not in another. And, you know, I think there's a lot of kind of domain specific [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4319.2s)]
*  reasons for that. You know, for me, as my legacy, as a public market investor, I'm very comfortable [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4324.16s)]
*  being both, you know, pro open AI and pro Tesla and pro X. And so I just kind of caveat that kind [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4329.44s)]
*  of, you know, as a first point, my second point is, can we do a slight detour on masa for one minute? [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4336.48s)]
*  And I'm curious to get your guys' opinion, but is masa the goat? Because when I started in the [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4343.12s)]
*  growth business, I met with your email, Nerni said, Thomas, you get in the hall of fame. If you can [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4349.04s)]
*  have one deal that gives you a billion dollar return, I E you know, whatever you invest, plus [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4353.36s)]
*  what you take out is a billion dollars or more. And he actually kept a tracker in his mind of who [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4357.92s)]
*  had made those deals and what share he had and et cetera. So let's go to masa for one minute. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4362.96s)]
*  Masa is the hundred billion dollar club. Yeah. Okay. And not only that he's actually done it twice. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4368.4800000000005s)]
*  He did it the first time with SoftBank and Alibaba, which at its peak was a 200 billion dollar win. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4374.72s)]
*  And I think he ultimately netted like 80 plus billion out of it. So that's one. He did it again [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4380.4800000000005s)]
*  with arm that he bought for 30 and now is sitting on a gain of a hundred, I think 35 billion. And [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4385.68s)]
*  he could have done it a third time with Nvidia, if he hadn't sold. I mean, guys, [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4394.240000000001s)]
*  there's nobody like him. There's incredible, incredible. So a hundred percent. Right. You [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4399.76s)]
*  got to give the man his flowers. He is. So I'll tell you what, Chamath, I am never betting against [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4404.320000000001s)]
*  masa ever because you got to give the man credit for what he's done. And so now let's go to kind of [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4408.88s)]
*  open AI. You guys mentioned we do own some open AI. I am bullish on open AI, which I guess is now a [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4416.8s)]
*  counter against the grain kind of view. But guys, my point of view on opening on the reason I'm so [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4423.04s)]
*  bullish is really kind of chat GPT. And I do think when opening, I guess, you know, we do, it does [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4429.6s)]
*  have different businesses, right? It's got the model business. It has the API business. And then [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4435.36s)]
*  it has the chat GPT business. Right. And if you look at the downloads, maybe Nick, bring up the [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4439.679999999999s)]
*  charts, but it is really interesting to watch the market share of chat GPT versus Google, Gemini and [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4444.4s)]
*  Grok. This is both in the U S and international. It really is a dominant kind of franchise, right? [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4450.88s)]
*  It is maintaining 80% plus market share. You know, J Cal, if this was ride sharing, right, [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4459.36s)]
*  we would say, wow, this, this company is the winner. Right. So to me, I think that the quality [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4464.88s)]
*  of the chat GPT franchise, right, I think they disclosed a 300 million weekly actives over a [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4471.04s)]
*  million enterprise users. It has become a core part of my own workflow. You know, I have it on [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4476.719999999999s)]
*  my phone. I have it on my desktop. I use it all the time. I can't even quantify the value that [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4484.8s)]
*  it brings. It's so important for what it does for me. So and I do think that it just keeps [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4490.96s)]
*  getting smarter. Every query that I ask, it learns more about me. It learns more about our system. So [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4496.4800000000005s)]
*  I do think the chat GPT franchise inside of open AI is one of the great, [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4503.04s)]
*  most successful, fastest growing kind of stories. So that's kind of the underpinning of my kind of [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4509.12s)]
*  opening eye thesis, you know, on Stargate specifically. Look, I think the real question [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4514.64s)]
*  to me isn't whether they have the 500 billion, right? Because we know that the 500 billion could [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4520.88s)]
*  come from equity. It could come from masa. If you look at Gavin's tweet, by the way, he does caveat [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4525.76s)]
*  it, right? Saying that assumes that masa doesn't want to sell arm and soft bank, right? So I'm not [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4530.88s)]
*  sure. Just lever it up and use debt. Correct. So you have debt. I think to me, the real question, [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4537.200000000001s)]
*  guys, is, do we ultimately believe that you can get an ROI on that 500 billion? Because if you can, [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4542.16s)]
*  there will be people that will want to fund it, right? You can do a data center by data center, [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4550.24s)]
*  you can do it actually at the GPU level, right? So the financing is there. To me, the 500 billion [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4556.4s)]
*  doesn't scare me from an absolute number. I think the question we really have to ask ourselves is, [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4563.5199999999995s)]
*  do we believe that the market is big enough, that the opportunity is big enough, [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4568.64s)]
*  that investors can get a return on the 500 billion? I think that's the real question. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4572.400000000001s)]
*  I think you framed it perfectly. And since you bring up ride sharing and the 80% there, [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4578.56s)]
*  I really think that's an important thing to take a moment to settle on. Because in that case, [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4582.64s)]
*  you didn't have Uber being challenged by Google, Microsoft, and Elon Musk, at the same time, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4591.04s)]
*  in a digital product as opposed to a real world product. And so when I use Gemini or XAI and [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4600.16s)]
*  ChatGPT and I use them all daily and Claude, the difference between the products right now [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4606.88s)]
*  is really narrow. And I think if the equivalent would be somebody who had 100 million cars [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4612.72s)]
*  on the road already competing against Uber, which doesn't exist or didn't exist at the time. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4620.96s)]
*  So that, I think, is the way I look at this as a slightly different type of race. I do believe the [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4627.84s)]
*  ChatGPT franchise is worth something, but I think enterprise folks, when I talk to them, want the [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4632.96s)]
*  open source product most of all. So anyway, I think it's still anybody's game right now. And I don't [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4639.36s)]
*  know how you get a return on 500 billion invested in this. That's the other thing. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4646.64s)]
*  And I don't know if that's the real number. Friberg, what do you think? [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4651.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't know. This is out here in some crazy- [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4656.08s)]
*  Well, I think, guys, the way these things happen is you don't fund it all equity up front. I think [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4661.360000000001s)]
*  these things get funded facility by facility, data center by data center across four years. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4666.160000000001s)]
*  And to Chamath's point, it's not just equity, it's site level debt, and et cetera. It's a complex [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4672.64s)]
*  capital structure to these things. But look, we live also in a world where I was just looking at [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4678.16s)]
*  this chart, the cloud capex chart. And we know that in total, 2025 capex for the top five players [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4683.84s)]
*  in the US is going to be 312 billion. So that's this year, that's in one year. So we can also [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4693.52s)]
*  frame this and say, hey, does that number make any sense versus what others are spending? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4700.48s)]
*  It's at least in the order of magnitude when you think about it's over four years. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4705.12s)]
*  By the way, another really interesting corollary on this point is the US internet companies spend [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4710.5599999999995s)]
*  20x what the Chinese companies spend on capex. Really interesting is we think about our [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4716.639999999999s)]
*  competitiveness. Dave, to your point, it's not just power, it's also compute. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4722.16s)]
*  I mean, pretty powerful that you're spending 20x what your competitor is on these kind of advanced [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4727.360000000001s)]
*  technologies. Chamath, how do you look at this? I think that value and money are correlated in [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4732.56s)]
*  some industries, like real estate or heavy industry, but I don't think that it's very [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4740.400000000001s)]
*  correlated in tech. And I tried to say this in my tweet, I don't know, Nick, can you find this tweet [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4745.4400000000005s)]
*  where I was just talking about the DeepSeq model? So what did we see last week? We saw a model that [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4751.360000000001s)]
*  got released by the Chinese under, by the way, a totally open source MIT license that you can [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4758.56s)]
*  run on a laptop. And it turned out to be as good as OpenAI's 01 model, so a couple of versions old. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4765.120000000001s)]
*  But the point is that this model cost millions of dollars and was able to compete with a model that [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4771.200000000001s)]
*  took billions of dollars to train. So my takeaway from that was that these costs are falling [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4779.12s)]
*  really precipitously. So that's sort of my one observation is spending more money [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4786.24s)]
*  doesn't necessarily get you further along if the goal is progress. And I think that that's very [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4791.76s)]
*  true in what we're learning about AI, because we're learning as we go along. So then I think it just [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4797.44s)]
*  brings up this question of what is the point of saying all these grandiose numbers? And [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4802.4s)]
*  this is where if you look at a different industry, like if you if an oil company [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4808.4800000000005s)]
*  came into the oval and said they were about to spend 500 billion, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4812.88s)]
*  you kind of know that it's real. Because you know what these things cost, and you know what the [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4817.120000000001s)]
*  entire infrastructure will be and you know, we've seen land so we know we know what goes on. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4822.64s)]
*  Yeah, so the deeper the oil is in the ground, and the harder the rock is that you got a breakthrough [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4827.92s)]
*  to get there, the more you have to spend. So those numbers become very grounded in reality. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4832.160000000001s)]
*  If you were a rocket company, and you wanted to build a rocket and send it to Mars, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4837.28s)]
*  you can also be very detailed in what the costs are. And you can assume some amount of reductions [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4841.44s)]
*  of scale, somebody said you'd have to spend 500 billion. The thing is that when in this world, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4846.4s)]
*  it seems that there are these advances that are happening that allow you to do things cheaper and [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4851.92s)]
*  cheaper almost overnight by spending one one thousandth of what you spent even six months ago. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4856.5599999999995s)]
*  I think the spending money part to be honest is more of a gimmick than it is a technical commitment. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4862.72s)]
*  So I guess if they want to spend the money go ahead, but it doesn't actually tie to whether [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4866.8s)]
*  they're going to be able to make custom vaccines, whether they're going to cure cancer. So I kind of [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4871.76s)]
*  thought that these things were just joined. And so my takeaway was entirely different. It was not a [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4876.56s)]
*  commentary on Mosa or Larry or Sam. I think all of those three companies are frankly, very good. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4881.76s)]
*  It was more a comment that you have to be very careful to protect the president's legacy, [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4889.92s)]
*  if I were them, to make sure that the things that get announced are actually further down the [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4897.759999999999s)]
*  technical spectrum and are actually going to be real. Because if they achieve these things, [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4902.88s)]
*  but it costs you a billion dollars and you only hire 50 people, there's going to be a little bit [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4908.08s)]
*  of egg on the face. And so that was sort of my own takeaway. I think that the things were decoupled. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4914.24s)]
*  It just seemed more marketing and sizzle and kind of hastily put together. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4918.8s)]
*  Aaron Powell It was definitely, yeah, put together with haste. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4923.6s)]
*  Yeah, you got that sense. But- [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4926.72s)]
*  Aaron Powell I think it would be great if OpenAI builds [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4928.08s)]
*  in another incredible model, whatever comes after 03, 04, 05. But it's not clear that you have to [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4930.4800000000005s)]
*  spend 500 billion to do it. Aaron Powell [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4935.360000000001s)]
*  You know, I think people are playing to what Trump likes, which is a big number, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4938.08s)]
*  and which is his influence on growing the number. So there was specific details where Mosa said, [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4942.72s)]
*  you know, I told you 100 billion, you challenged me to get two, I came back with five. Right? And [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4948.32s)]
*  so this is the sort of Trump ethos is, hey, we're going to swing for the fences. In a way, you know, [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4955.04s)]
*  you could be critical of it and be like, well, Trump's a BS artist or whatever. Or if you're [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4960.32s)]
*  from Silicon Valley, you can say, hey, listen, he's moonshotting it. He's going to just shoot for the [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4965.28s)]
*  stars and get the moon. So if these guys wind up spending 50 billion or 100 billion, it makes us [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4969.599999999999s)]
*  more competitive, more power to them. Aaron Powell [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4974.639999999999s)]
*  The question I had was, you know, was, did Elon have any insight that this was happening? [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4975.76s)]
*  Probably not from the reaction on X. Aaron Powell [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4983.12s)]
*  I bet he did. You know, I think you're, I have no insight either. But I do think if you were going [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4986.0s)]
*  to be critical of Trump, that he was putting his thumb on the scale for any one company or individual, [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4991.92s)]
*  this shows that he's not. It's an open platform. The Trump administration is an open platform, [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=4997.52s)]
*  highest bidder gets to come to the White House. Whoever spends the most, whoever buys the most [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5003.76s)]
*  military, you know, buys the most ammunition from us, you're going to get your time in the White [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5008.24s)]
*  House. It's a, this is a capitalist country and this is the greatest one in the world. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5013.5199999999995s)]
*  Equal opportunity. Anybody can make a bet. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5018.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, one of the obvious, the obvious consequence of this data center and chip [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5020.32s)]
*  infrastructure effort, which is obviously going to happen with or without government involvement [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5026.64s)]
*  is an increase in electricity demand. Thomas, I know you've got some slides. Do you want to pull [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5032.0s)]
*  those up and show them? Because I think they're something I've talked a lot about on the show, [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5036.719999999999s)]
*  which is the difference in electricity production capacity in the U.S. versus China, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5043.04s)]
*  historically, and then prospectively going forward. Ultimately, as I've talked about in the [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5049.28s)]
*  past, right, the U.S. today is paying roughly, you know, call it one and a half to three X, [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5055.28s)]
*  the price per kilowatt hour for electricity in the United States over what China's paying. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5060.48s)]
*  We have, I believe, half of the electricity production capacity of China. They're adding [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5064.88s)]
*  more. The cost to add is one-tenth of what our cost to add is. Call it one-tenth to one-half [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5071.12s)]
*  our cost to add per new gigawatt of production capacity. Everything is in the wrong direction. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5076.4s)]
*  Ultimately, if AI and automation are the critical factors for economic growth going forward and [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5081.92s)]
*  electricity is the critical input to that, we are hugely disadvantaged and aren't going to catch up. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5088.64s)]
*  It seems like you've pulled this analysis together, which kind of indicates the same, [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5094.0s)]
*  if you think it makes sense to walk through this now. Yeah, yeah, I'd be happy to. I mean, [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5098.24s)]
*  Dave, you're 100% right. If you think of the GPU as the atomic unit of the future, [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5102.64s)]
*  right, and the key competitive advantage and the key kind of ingredient, you can't power a GPU [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5108.719999999999s)]
*  without a data center and you can't use a data center without power. So I do think at the end [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5116.96s)]
*  of the day, it really comes down to the grid and it comes down to power. So I think that's kind of [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5122.639999999999s)]
*  constraint number one. The other thing, Dave, that I think is really important is in an inflationary [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5128.08s)]
*  era, you do not want to increase or have this industry be perceived to be increasing electricity [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5135.6s)]
*  prices for the consumer. Right. So somehow we need to add capacity. We need to make it so the [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5141.76s)]
*  consumer kind of doesn't go bonkers by having their bills go higher. And we can, Nick, run [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5147.52s)]
*  through a couple of the slides, but the data shows exactly kind of your point, Dave, right, which is [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5154.64s)]
*  we basically did not invest for a very long period of time, right, in our grid and China did. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5159.92s)]
*  And if you keep going, we can kind of run through these a couple of times, but [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5167.36s)]
*  that wasn't always the case. You know, during kind of like the post-World War II boom era, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5171.68s)]
*  during the information age, you know, we did invest and we did a lot of it. And then suddenly [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5177.68s)]
*  in 2000, we just kind of stopped. And this is globalization you're saying is why we stopped. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5184.0s)]
*  Exactly. Right. We start to outsource. Is there an interpretation of that, that we didn't have [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5189.360000000001s)]
*  factories? We didn't have factories, so we didn't need as much power. What's the reason we didn't [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5193.280000000001s)]
*  invest or we didn't need to? I think we just outsourced a lot of our hardcore manufacturing. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5197.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I guess. Correct. That's kind of off-shoring. So no factories equals no need for [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5202.96s)]
*  additional electricity. Now the new factories are H100 factories. We need them back. Exactly. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5208.72s)]
*  RAI factories, right. And by the way, the way to think about it is almost like a subscription [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5214.48s)]
*  business on a net ad basis, right? So this makes it even more stark, right? Because this is kind of [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5220.96s)]
*  net additions and it just kind of speaks for itself, right? Just read the numbers out so [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5227.2s)]
*  the audience that's listening can get a sense here. Yeah. I mean, you can see, I mean, since 1985, [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5232.719999999999s)]
*  the Delta roughly between China and the US is almost, what's the quick math? It's almost 7X, [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5238.719999999999s)]
*  right? In 2000, the US and China were both roughly a thousand terawatt hours. Today, the US is 1600 [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5246.5599999999995s)]
*  terawatt hours and China is 9,000 terawatt hours. Yeah. And this is just an extraordinary ramp up [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5252.799999999999s)]
*  relative to correct US emissions. On the AI side, there was a Biden EO last week. I spoke about this [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5260.32s)]
*  on Tucker because it happened the day I went on Tucker, but the EO basically said, we will allow [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5267.76s)]
*  the permitting of power plants on federal lands to power these AI data centers, which started off [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5274.16s)]
*  like a very intelligent EO, but right in the second paragraph started to talk about DEI and [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5282.24s)]
*  all this other stuff and how you had to have a certain percentage of it from certain sources. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5287.6s)]
*  But just today, it looked like President Trump overturned it and now it's full seam ahead. If [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5292.08s)]
*  you have it permitted, then it's all about just get the power, however you need the power, [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5296.56s)]
*  which I think is the smart decision. Back to your earlier point, like we are in a race here. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5300.72s)]
*  In your analysis, Thomas, can we do this without nuclear? [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5305.4400000000005s)]
*  No. Can we catch up without nuclear? Okay. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5307.92s)]
*  In fact, we can't and- Why we buy uranium? [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5310.240000000001s)]
*  I think you can speak to that better. One of the really interesting parts, [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5312.96s)]
*  you can see by the way, just the percentage of nuclear, it needs to go higher. I don't know if [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5318.56s)]
*  you guys have been following this stock in the public market guys called Constellation Energy. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5328.56s)]
*  Oh yeah. It's a really interesting idea. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5332.8s)]
*  What's interesting of what Amazon and Microsoft is they're actually signing deals directly with [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5337.68s)]
*  these companies to do what's called back behind the meter types of deal. They have direct energy [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5343.6s)]
*  access. To your point, Shamath, on the Biden administration, at the end of last year, [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5350.88s)]
*  a deal got announced, publicly announced, that federal agencies were also contracting directly [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5357.120000000001s)]
*  now with CEG to power some of their facilities. Even though in total the number was small, [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5363.68s)]
*  we took it and I think the market took it as a clear indication [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5372.32s)]
*  that the government, even under Biden, was acknowledging that nuclear is the best path [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5376.879999999999s)]
*  forward. We expect and we think just the trend generally towards nuclear energy is going to [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5382.16s)]
*  continue. It's been proven in China. It's been proven in Europe. I think it will show to be a [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5389.599999999999s)]
*  key part of the AI arms race over the next 10, 20 years. This is to me the story in one slide, [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5395.12s)]
*  which is if you look at basically the nuclear capacity in the US, it's basically been flat for [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5404.16s)]
*  25 plus years. Ridiculous. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5411.28s)]
*  When Scott Besson was asked, are we in a green energy arms race with China, he was thinking about [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5416.24s)]
*  chart number on the right, which basically shows how much nuclear China has added over that time [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5425.5199999999995s)]
*  period. I think it's pretty clear what the answer is. I think China is leading the way in that [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5432.64s)]
*  measure and I think we need to follow. I think what's really important to note is over that [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5438.88s)]
*  same period of time, Thomas, we're in a different era on nuclear than we were when we had Three [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5445.92s)]
*  Mile Island and prior to that Chernobyl. We have new Gen 4 technologies that are meltdown proof, [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5452.16s)]
*  that have a totally different architecture where there isn't a setup where you have runaway heat [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5461.5199999999995s)]
*  and ultimately a collapse of the reactor and a release of radioactive material, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5466.88s)]
*  which is what happened at Chernobyl. These new systems, which we highlighted on the show a [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5473.28s)]
*  couple of months ago, like the Pebble Bed reactor that's been in production making electricity in [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5477.36s)]
*  China, are incredible new technology architectures and they're here and they're running. China's [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5481.679999999999s)]
*  rolling out dozens or hundreds of these and the United States is rolling out zero and that needs [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5488.0s)]
*  to change. I think we only have a couple of months to get the engine stood up that will allow us to [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5493.839999999999s)]
*  make the material, that will allow us to make the production technology needed to actually deploy [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5500.799999999999s)]
*  these stations to try and have a shot at catching up. If we don't, we're going to be hugely [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5505.92s)]
*  disadvantaged on an energy cost basis. We're going to be hugely disadvantaged on an ability [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5510.24s)]
*  to actually deploy AI technology competitively. That's key. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5513.52s)]
*  By the way, you also can look at France, my home country, not known as a technology leader, but [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5517.28s)]
*  70% of its energy, of its electricity comes from nuclear. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5523.68s)]
*  France held the line when Europe tried to really deprecate its use of nuclear, Germany did, but [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5527.92s)]
*  France held the line. Yeah, it's too important, Jamal. It's 70% plus. So I think there's examples, [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5532.88s)]
*  it's doable and I think now with AI, it's a matter of national security. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5539.12s)]
*  National security. We got to get it done. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5542.96s)]
*  By the way, that'll dovetail into fabs, which is obviously another key component, [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5546.96s)]
*  which is a short term for semiconductor manufacturing facilities, which is another, [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5552.32s)]
*  in my opinion, key strategic area that we need to ramp up in the US. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5558.16s)]
*  The thing that I noticed about that chart is the trend line. I mean, look at how fast they're [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5562.48s)]
*  building these. And this is where, you know, I don't know what government incentive we need to [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5568.0s)]
*  create or what red tape has to be moved here. But if we can't build, you know, multifamily [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5572.5599999999995s)]
*  housing in some states, like this nuclear is going to really need to, we're going to have to [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5578.719999999999s)]
*  figure out a way to change that trend line, Freiburg. Yeah. I mean, what would it take to [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5585.679999999999s)]
*  build these nuclear power plants at an accelerated rate? I will tell you that there is a lot of [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5592.08s)]
*  capital and we mentioned this last time, a lot of intellectual capital in the United States that's [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5596.4s)]
*  eager, hungry and ready to get moving on build out. The only thing that's challenged and the [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5601.12s)]
*  only thing that's holding it back is regulatory challenges, regulatory roadblocks. And if those [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5606.4s)]
*  get removed through emergency action, I view this to be more of a national security threat, frankly, [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5612.48s)]
*  than the border. I think we need to get energy increased in this country in an accelerated way [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5617.84s)]
*  for the United States to even be in a position to be able to challenge China with respect to [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5622.88s)]
*  manufacturing and AI in the decades ahead. And the United States needs to consider this an emergency. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5628.32s)]
*  Emergency declarations may be needed to drop the regulatory roadblocks that are keeping the [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5634.8s)]
*  proliferation of electricity production in the United States at bay. I think it's time for that [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5639.6s)]
*  sort of action. So I think that's the only thing that's getting in the way. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5645.44s)]
*  So we have the tech, we have the physics, we have the will, we have the talent, [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5648.24s)]
*  we have a blocker and the blocker is regulation and that regulatory blocker needs to have [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5653.5199999999995s)]
*  leadership in government to remove it. Am I summarizing correctly here? [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5659.36s)]
*  That's right. And look, you have an energy czar that I think is very aligned with that intention [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5664.879999999999s)]
*  and in Doug Burgum, obviously we have this big AI arms race that's underway. We have an automation [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5668.5599999999995s)]
*  and manufacturing demand, which will massively increase energy demand in this country. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5674.96s)]
*  And we have, I think, a deregulatory administration. The stars are aligned and I think that this is a [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5679.68s)]
*  moment where this could happen. Chamath or Thomas, what's the downside [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5686.08s)]
*  to removing the regulation and going for it and building this extra capacity? Can we define [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5691.6s)]
*  any possible downside? Yeah, the downside is the amount of time it takes to adequately build these [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5697.12s)]
*  things properly. The thing that China has had, it's as Thomas's chart shows, is decades of [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5703.68s)]
*  practice in building things safely and quickly. We can build things, but we haven't had the practice [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5709.4400000000005s)]
*  to build them either safely or quickly because we haven't built any. So that's a complicated [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5715.92s)]
*  thing to just acknowledge. That's a valid concern. If there is any resistance to this, Thomas, [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5720.96s)]
*  what would be on the top of that list? Just theoretically, how could anybody want to block [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5727.12s)]
*  this? What would be the resistance? One other element, guys, I think you know that we are [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5732.4s)]
*  blocking the ability of China to get access to the latest GPUs, right? And the whole point is we [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5737.599999999999s)]
*  don't want them to use to develop systems that could be used against us. But if China, if one [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5742.719999999999s)]
*  day China has 10 XR power capacity, it won't even matter, right? Because they'll just have so many [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5748.24s)]
*  more, whether they're not quite the same advanced GPUs or not, they'll just have so many more of [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5754.799999999999s)]
*  them. Their industrial AI capacity will be so much larger that even if we have the best H100s [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5758.88s)]
*  and the latest technology that Jensen and others can provide, it won't matter. So in order to make [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5766.08s)]
*  our strategy effective, we need to be able to build this power base. I think it's a very astute [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5771.4400000000005s)]
*  point. Hey, Chamath, I don't know if you've been watching Netflix, but I am a shareholder and I am [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5779.04s)]
*  delighted. I don't know what's going on over there, but they seem to be getting their subs right. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5785.76s)]
*  And that disgrace of a fight seems to have somehow driven the stock price up and there's some [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5790.0s)]
*  strategy that's working over there. Maybe you could just riff on it for a moment. I have the [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5795.92s)]
*  opposite take. Okay. Yeah, I mean, it's obviously a very good company. I think it's been incredibly [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5800.88s)]
*  performant, but I think it has like a little bit of a dark commentary on [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5808.88s)]
*  American society and productivity. So I asked Nick to just put up these three charts. I'll show you [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5815.68s)]
*  the first one. So this is the Netflix stock price from 2010 to 2020 and it's only gotten up since [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5822.24s)]
*  2024. Okay. The only reason I did it at 2020 was because the other data, I went to the CDC and I [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5829.4400000000005s)]
*  said, well, show me the percentage of people, Americans taking SSRIs over that same period. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5837.28s)]
*  For depression, anxiety, et cetera. And what you see that it's also gone up. And then the last chart, [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5843.12s)]
*  I went to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and I said, what has happened to the labor [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5849.5199999999995s)]
*  participation rate over the same period? So I'm not blaming Netflix, but I think that this is a [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5853.2s)]
*  bit of a commentary on sort of what's happening in society. It's a little bit of a leading indicator [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5860.72s)]
*  where as the company does better and better, the reality is that that company wins by being a sink [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5869.12s)]
*  for people's time. It's where you go to Netflix and chill. It's a phrase that we all understand, [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5876.56s)]
*  but the dark underbelly of it is that there's just a lot of people that are a little bit more [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5883.04s)]
*  dejected. There's a lot of people that just opt out and just don't decide to work. I think you could [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5888.0s)]
*  graph the fertility rate and it's gone down rateably as well. So it's all of this soup [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5895.2s)]
*  that is about people living in a life that unfortunately just doesn't exist. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5902.64s)]
*  So, I mean, it's a well-run business and I wish them all the best at some level, [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5909.2s)]
*  but at some other level, I think it's a commentary that as this company does better and better, [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5913.44s)]
*  there are more and more people that are living a shell of what their life could be. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5918.24s)]
*  So causing correlation aside- So obviously correlated. This is not causal. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5923.44s)]
*  Yes. Netflix is not causing depression, but- It's just the thing. And there's other things [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5928.32s)]
*  that obviously you can put on this plate. Sure. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5933.679999999999s)]
*  But that was my reaction is I just think that the more time people are sort of detaching and [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5936.4800000000005s)]
*  plugging out, the more that you're going to see these companies that provide ways of distracting [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5946.16s)]
*  yourself do well. I'm not sure that society benefits. What do you think, Thomas, [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5952.8s)]
*  Opioid for the masses or just the golden era of television? [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5957.360000000001s)]
*  What I'm curious, Chamath, is how much of it is a substitutive effect away from traditional media? [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5960.88s)]
*  I've kind of looked at it as different ways that at least the way it's measured, [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5971.84s)]
*  time spent watching television has not really increased over 20 years. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5976.72s)]
*  To me, it's more a reflection of I could overlay the stock chart of Fox and Comcast and CBS and [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5982.400000000001s)]
*  all of those have imploded. I think people have been kind of substituting away. I think the [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5991.68s)]
*  question then that you have to ask is, is there a reason that maybe the Netflix product is [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=5998.56s)]
*  fundamentally more unsafe or detrimental to someone's health than the prior broadcast? [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6002.56s)]
*  The one thing that I would say is, and this is not a Netflix commentary, but a general commentary, [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6009.92s)]
*  which is online products versus linear products have the power and the benefit of this algorithmic [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6014.0s)]
*  targeting and personalization. And I think that what Netflix has successfully figured out [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6021.84s)]
*  and a bunch of other products have successfully figured out is that you can hyper tune to what [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6027.68s)]
*  people think they want. But what people think they want is not necessarily what they need. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6032.88s)]
*  I think when you had linear television, you kind of had to take what was given. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6039.28s)]
*  You didn't love Cheers, but you watched Cheers. You didn't love saying elsewhere, but you watched it. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6042.88s)]
*  Now it's that you can go into a place where the thing really feeds you and it gives you a very [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6048.4s)]
*  visceral feedback loop and you can stay there binge watching something for an entire weekend. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6056.719999999999s)]
*  And what didn't, I think the question is what didn't you do? Necessarily didn't work out, [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6062.719999999999s)]
*  necessarily didn't eat well. Didn't spend time with friends. And by the way, I'm not saying that I [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6068.0s)]
*  don't do it. I've done it as well. Like our group chat, one of the interesting things when Jason [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6074.0s)]
*  he's very good about television and stuff. He says, this series is amazing. Our other friend, [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6078.96s)]
*  Rob Goldberg does the same thing. It's hard for me to start it and then not end it. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6083.12s)]
*  It's addicting. Yeah. But I have to really check myself because then for those two days, [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6089.12s)]
*  I'll be tempted to not leave my bedroom. My kids are like, where's my father? And so I think it [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6095.2s)]
*  happens to all of us. It's just a thing that, again, I'm not trying to pick on Netflix. I'm [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6102.16s)]
*  just trying to say societally. I think we want people that are vigorous and engaged in the real [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6106.88s)]
*  world. And there needs to be a balance. Yeah. I wholeheartedly agree. And I think you have [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6112.08s)]
*  to schedule these things. You have to make it a permanent part of your life. Playing poker on a [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6120.56s)]
*  certain night of the week, doing certain things on the weekends with your kids, having certain [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6124.88s)]
*  rituals. The real damage to our kids is not that the screens are damaging them, it's that it's [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6128.88s)]
*  replacing time. I think what you were alluding to there, Thomas, this anxious generation, [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6134.8s)]
*  as Jonathan Haidt, and we had a great interview with him, myself and Freberg in the All In Interview [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6139.92s)]
*  series. That is what's happening. Kids are substituting, whether it's TikTok or Netflix [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6144.24s)]
*  or YouTube time for time with their friends, time doing physical activities. So you really just have [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6150.320000000001s)]
*  to limit the screen time so that those other things and the boredom can emerge. And we will [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6155.92s)]
*  be having a talk in the coming years about dopamine. It is something that these algorithms [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6160.16s)]
*  have gotten really good at doing, which is firing your dopamine. Every time you swipe that TikTok, [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6168.08s)]
*  every time you get to the cliffhanger in a series or a Mr. Beast video, not singling anybody out, [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6173.04s)]
*  he's just a master of it as well. They're just all really good at giving you that hook, [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6178.72s)]
*  that amazing moment. And musicians are doing this now too with the hooks and then the hooks go on [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6183.2s)]
*  TikTok. The dopamine addiction, when you get burnt out late at night, getting those dopamine [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6188.24s)]
*  hits, the next day you feel depressed. Then you go to a doctor and the doctor said, oh, well, [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6194.16s)]
*  you have depression. So here's your well-beauten or here's whatever the, I don't know what the [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6198.8s)]
*  things are of the moment. I'll just tell you what I focus on and what I focus on with my family. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6204.719999999999s)]
*  Sleep hygiene, diet, exercise, meditation. Do these four things and you will reverse these trends. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6209.76s)]
*  You don't need it. Listen, I don't want to tell you what to do. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6219.12s)]
*  Meditation is hard for kids, but I get the first three. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6221.28s)]
*  You know what? Try it. Get the, and listen, I'm not talking about a book here. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6224.32s)]
*  By the way, you know what's crazy? [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6227.44s)]
*  Get the Calm app. It has a bunch of stuff for kids. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6227.92s)]
*  When I was growing up, I grew up Buddhist. My father would make us sit there at nine o'clock [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6231.44s)]
*  every night and my sisters and I would have to say this Buddhist prayer and then he would make [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6236.72s)]
*  us close our eyes for 15 minutes. And he said, meditate. And I was like, I don't know what [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6242.16s)]
*  meditation is, but I was forced to just keep my eyes shut. And I would just daydream. But I suspect [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6245.92s)]
*  that there was like some reasonably grounding value in that. So I get what you're saying. I just [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6251.6s)]
*  have such a negative connotation from it. I've never been able to come back to it because of [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6256.8s)]
*  that experience, but I would just daydream. And by the way, what I daydreamed was getting out of that [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6260.4800000000005s)]
*  house. I got to be successful. So you got a vision. A vision came to you. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6264.32s)]
*  I got to manifest some success here because this sucks. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6268.88s)]
*  Hey Thomas, thanks for coming on the show. Great first appearance here as the best. We'd love to [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6271.36s)]
*  have you back. Unless the king returns at some point, you're the best. You should come back [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6275.2s)]
*  and you should also come back to the All-in Summit. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6281.44s)]
*  Come back. Yeah, we'll be great. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6285.04s)]
*  I know we saw some great topics like Hoktan and others that I want to get to someday. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6286.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, that's actually when you come back, which we will do at some point in the next few months, [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6291.84s)]
*  I would love for us to double click into Hoktan. So for folks that are listening, [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6295.599999999999s)]
*  we were going back and forth. Hoktan is the CEO of Broadcom. And the reason when Thomas brought [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6300.64s)]
*  this up, hey guys, let's double click into Broadcom and the CEO, the reason why I was excited is that [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6306.48s)]
*  it is the only trillion dollar company that nobody talks about. Everybody knows Nvidia. Everybody [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6313.2s)]
*  knows Amazon Meta. But Broadcom is a $1.12 trillion business and it started basically through a whole [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6319.44s)]
*  series of roll ups. Anyways, we'll double click into this with you because I think it's so fascinating. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6328.639999999999s)]
*  No, this is not the Broadcom we're all thinking of from the telecom era, is it? [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6332.16s)]
*  It is. Yeah, Henry Samuoli. Yeah. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6336.0s)]
*  Correct. And in fact, I will leave you guys with a teaser to tease the next episode when we talk [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6338.16s)]
*  about it. And I'll tell you the story that when Hawk bought Broadcom, J Cal, to your point, [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6345.6s)]
*  Broadcom is the pride of Orange County founded by Henry Nicholas and Henry Samuoli, kind of legends [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6351.76s)]
*  and semiconductors, a legendary name. So it meant a lot to them that the combined company, Avago, [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6357.04s)]
*  was buying Broadcom, keep the name Broadcom. And so Hawk, being who he is, got a little bit of a [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6362.56s)]
*  price discount to name the company Broadcom to him. That was a great deal. That's who Hawk is. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6368.64s)]
*  He's a great businessman. But what is the ticker of this particular company? [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6373.92s)]
*  Avgo. And so I said, Hawk, why is the ticker still Avgo? And you know what he said to me, [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6378.16s)]
*  turning to me, he said, Thomas, they forgot to negotiate for the ticker. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6383.52s)]
*  Oh, never forget the ticker. Interesting. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6387.6s)]
*  I mean, when he started, what was the market cap? [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6392.24s)]
*  3.5 billion, Chamath. Not only was it an orphan because it was a spin out of HP, [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6395.76s)]
*  it was a spin out of HP. It was a double orphan. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6403.04s)]
*  300x. Look at this. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6408.56s)]
*  In the last five years, the market cap's grown by 8x. Nvidia's grown by 20x. But, you know, [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6412.64s)]
*  Intel over the last five years is what? Down 70%. So, you know, I think there's a big divergence. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6420.0s)]
*  Thomas, do you think this is a function of, [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6426.8s)]
*  well, I don't know if it's directionally investing in the right things or is it about [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6429.44s)]
*  like making long-term investments and thinking down the road? I mean, obviously the compounding [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6434.4800000000005s)]
*  advantages. He's an M&A master. This is less about, [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6439.36s)]
*  there was a product that won and more of a portfolio approach and a portfolio construction. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6443.12s)]
*  But did he buy well ahead of the curve? Did he buy over the horizon, Thomas? Like, [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6446.88s)]
*  you know, is that where Intel really missed? I think Intel really missed. It's a complete [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6451.52s)]
*  abdication of corporate governance at the board level and the CEO level. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6456.5599999999995s)]
*  Hey guys, breaking news story coming across my feet. I don't know if you can pull this up, [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6460.799999999999s)]
*  Nick, but there's a video trending on the internet. Apparently, an executive order has just [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6464.4s)]
*  gone across the president's desk and it was delivered by none other than a gentleman named [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6468.799999999999s)]
*  David Sachs. Now there's a name I haven't heard in a long time. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6475.04s)]
*  Is that a crypto EO? We're going to be forming an internal working group to make [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6478.24s)]
*  America the world capital and crypto under your leadership. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6482.5599999999995s)]
*  Which is really going up, right? Absolutely. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6485.76s)]
*  Here we go. Whoa. Look at this. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6490.08s)]
*  What? He's using a Sharpie there to sign these executive orders. Oh, Sachs gets to keep the pen. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6496.8s)]
*  There it is. An executive order. I love how he holds them up. It's so great. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6502.72s)]
*  I wonder if Sachs gets to keep that. They might not be excited, but we're [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6507.52s)]
*  going to make a lot of money for the country. Thank you, sir. And so is David. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6510.88s)]
*  Oh, your reaction, Chema. I think this is great. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6518.16s)]
*  So we're going to make crypto great again. I'll be a little bit more specific. So I think that [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6523.6s)]
*  there are a handful of ideas that if we can implement them correctly, are really revolutionary. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6527.52s)]
*  I think that gets good to have a stockpile of crypto. I have less of an opinion on that. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6535.360000000001s)]
*  I think a set of stablecoin rails that makes payments instantaneous and costless [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6541.28s)]
*  is an enormous acceleration to GDP. It would cut fraud. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6550.64s)]
*  And I think that David's going to go and figure that out. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6558.16s)]
*  You're talking about stablecoins specifically? [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6561.4400000000005s)]
*  Stablecoins. I mean, I talked about this at the beginning of the year as one of my predictions, [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6563.360000000001s)]
*  but I do think that the United States stablecoin rails will be hugely disruptive and value added. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6567.68s)]
*  He's going to have help from the head of the SEC and the head of treasury to do it. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6575.68s)]
*  I just think it's great. I think Sachs is already off to a hugely fast start. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6580.240000000001s)]
*  The entire country knows that we need to win the AI race. The numbers are the numbers. You put up [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6584.16s)]
*  a chart like that, Thomas, and there's only one way for us to win, and that's to build more nuclear [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6591.6s)]
*  power plants. And so I think he's just got to hammer this through and let's see who tries to [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6596.24s)]
*  stop it. I don't know if AOC or Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas, Bernie Sanders, who wants to jump in [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6601.679999999999s)]
*  front of this Trump train right now, but I think you'll get slaughtered. If only there was somebody [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6606.5599999999995s)]
*  who could comment on this executive order. That's what I need. You know, Chamath, if I had the bat [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6611.36s)]
*  phone, if I could call somebody, you know, phone a friend? Who would you call? I don't know. You know, [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6616.639999999999s)]
*  I had my saxi pool was always on speed dial. We used to hang in between, have these great [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6622.64s)]
*  battles here on the pod. Then we go play chess together. We go have some drinks at the battery, [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6627.6s)]
*  but you know, that was a different era. And you know, I don't got my boy anymore. He's busy. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6632.64s)]
*  Oh, do we got everybody? Thanks for tuning into the all in podcast. I'm your host, [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6638.240000000001s)]
*  Jason Calacanis. We will see you next time. Bye. Sorry. What? What? There he is. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6643.76s)]
*  He's back. Back to reclaim his seat. It's yours. We miss you, buddy. You look so handsome. I'm gonna [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6650.8s)]
*  cry. 61 days without my bestie. We miss you. Were you just in the Oval Office? I was just in the Oval [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6658.08s)]
*  Office. First time in the Oval Office. Let me ask you a question. Was that your first time in the Oval? [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6665.84s)]
*  Well, technically it was my second, but. How was it, Sucks? How's it been so far? It was pretty [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6672.16s)]
*  incredible. Yeah, it's really been pretty incredible. Well, tell us what are the vibes [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6678.32s)]
*  and what's it like to go in to the Oval Office and to have that executive order sign tickets? [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6684.0s)]
*  Tell us what the moment was like and then tell us what's in the executive order. Well, we actually, [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6691.44s)]
*  we did three executive orders today. So we did one on crypto, one on AI, and then one on PCAST, [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6695.759999999999s)]
*  which is the President's Council of Advisors for Science and Technology. The one on crypto, [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6701.92s)]
*  I guess we can start there. The main thing it does is it forms an internal working group [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6706.8s)]
*  with the goal of making the US the world leader in crypto. So it's not one specific action. It's [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6712.4800000000005s)]
*  basically authorizing and creating a working group with the goal of achieving that objective. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6717.84s)]
*  And the members of this working group are gonna be, there's me, there's the head of the SEC, [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6725.2s)]
*  the Secretary of the Treasury, and all the agencies and departments that have an interest [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6730.64s)]
*  in crypto. So we formed this working group. I'm actually chairing it, or I will be. And again, [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6734.72s)]
*  the goal here is to identify and make recommendations that the departments would then take back and they [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6741.2s)]
*  could execute. And just again, with the goal of making America the world capital of crypto, [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6749.360000000001s)]
*  as the President said at Davos today. And then the other two, Sachs? [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6754.64s)]
*  Yeah, so that's crypto. Next one's AI. So the number one thing that that EO does is rescind [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6757.76s)]
*  the Biden EO, which we talked about on this podcast, I don't know how many episodes ago, [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6764.4s)]
*  but remember, it was this 100 page monstrosity of burdensome regulation. And the President had [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6769.28s)]
*  promised on the campaign trail to repeal that and he did. So it got rescinded. Actually, [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6774.879999999999s)]
*  there was a master EO on Monday that contained dozens of Biden era EOs that got mass rescinded. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6780.799999999999s)]
*  This one provided a little more detail on it. Basically said that that EO wasn't necessarily [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6788.32s)]
*  burdensome. It said that we want to be the world leader in AI. In fact, it uses the word [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6793.28s)]
*  dominate. We want to basically have global dominance in AI. And similar to what we're [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6799.679999999999s)]
*  doing on the crypto side, it directs the creation of an AI action plan. And that study will be led [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6804.48s)]
*  by three people, the National Security Advisor, who is Mike Waltz, the director of the Office of [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6810.88s)]
*  Science and Technology Policy, who will be Michael Kratzios as soon as he's sent and confirmed. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6816.0s)]
*  And then the third person is me. So the three of us are going to work together on this AI action [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6822.0s)]
*  plan. And the idea is to figure out what is it that the industry actually needs to make us, [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6825.76s)]
*  number one, globally in AI. So it's putting a little bit more substance behind like what this [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6830.4s)]
*  our role means. And the last one is to build a science council. I don't know if everybody's [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6836.88s)]
*  familiar with that. So maybe you could just describe what that is generally for the audience. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6842.0s)]
*  Well, PCAST has been around for a long time. I mean, I think it's been around for decades. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6845.84s)]
*  And the goal of PCAST is to assemble a group of top science and technology minds to provide the [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6851.36s)]
*  president with advice. So this was already announced, but basically, me and Michael Kratzios, [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6856.4s)]
*  who I mentioned before, is going to be the director of OSTP. We're going to be co-chairing that. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6863.2s)]
*  And this is an EO that provides the authorizing language to set that up. And then it provides [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6867.679999999999s)]
*  some direction around what PCAST is going to do. I think some of the language that Freeberg may like [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6872.4s)]
*  is just it talks about the need to return to kind of truth telling in science and kind of getting [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6877.68s)]
*  away from woke science. The AI order discusses this as well. We don't want AI models to be [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6885.04s)]
*  ideologically biased, have an agenda. I don't know if it uses the word woke AI, but that's basically [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6890.96s)]
*  what it's talking about. We want AI models to be as politically unbiased as possible. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6895.6s)]
*  Well, if you need a recommendation for somebody for the council, I know somebody who is extremely [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6899.52s)]
*  well versed on science. He's got a broad array of science knowledge. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6904.32s)]
*  Hear, hear. Yeah, I have an idea. Then we could have two besties in and around the White House. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6908.5599999999995s)]
*  Hey, well, thanks for including us in so many aspects of the weekend. And the audience really [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6914.4s)]
*  wants to know what are the chances we get SACS back on the pod now and again in 2025. And we [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6920.08s)]
*  do appreciate it. We're doing it right now, right? [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6928.32s)]
*  Sacrifice. We're doing it right now, but audience is not going to just accept this little drop in [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6930.16s)]
*  here. They want to know what's the long-term plan for David SACS and the pod. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6936.16s)]
*  And what's happened with media overall in the administration now that confirmation hearings [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6940.48s)]
*  are underway SACS and closing out. Does that mean folks are going to be able to get back [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6944.8s)]
*  on social and things that they were kind of restricted by over the last couple of weeks? [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6948.88s)]
*  Sure. But I think that if you're working for the White House, there kind of needs to be a reason [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6954.64s)]
*  for you to be out there because you don't want to be making news that you're not supposed to. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6958.96s)]
*  So in the case here today, the president signed these executive orders on crypto and AI, [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6963.6s)]
*  and they want me explaining them. So it makes sense for me to go out there. I've got a [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6970.8s)]
*  appearance on Fox business in about an hour to talk about the EOs as well. So that might come out [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6975.12s)]
*  before this podcast comes out, but you guys are the first ones I'm actually talking to. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6981.52s)]
*  But so there's a reason for me to come out and do it. And I think that there probably will need [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6985.52s)]
*  to be a good reason for me to come on the pod, but I'm going to try and come on the pod every [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6990.56s)]
*  chance I get. All right. Well, this is our appeal to DJ T to let you come on [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6994.64s)]
*  and just chew the fat and maybe there are some upside to it for him. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=6999.76s)]
*  Do you miss being on the pod, SACS? Oh, yeah, sure. Of course. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7003.4400000000005s)]
*  We miss you so much. Look, I'll be back. Don't worry. At some point. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7007.84s)]
*  Are you a little emotional right now, SACS? What are your favorite memories from [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7014.96s)]
*  the inauguration weekend? Well, the inauguration ceremony itself was really pretty spectacular. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7020.96s)]
*  You were there in the Capitol, Chamath. Yeah. It's funny. Jack and I kind of took our seats [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7025.92s)]
*  in the rotunda, like kind of in the back in the peanut gallery. And I thought that's where I was [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7030.88s)]
*  going to be sitting. And then somebody comes up to me and says, Mr. SACS, we have a seat for you up [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7034.4800000000005s)]
*  front. And so they put me on the dais. You were with the big boys. Yeah. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7040.16s)]
*  It was like the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Treasury, and then me, [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7043.6s)]
*  you know, and then we were just, we were behind the Trump family. You may not see me because [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7047.68s)]
*  those Trump kids are pretty tall, but that whole family is very tall. So I kind of disappeared a [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7052.32s)]
*  little bit. But in any event, they put me on the dais, which was really pretty crazy. I wasn't [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7059.2s)]
*  expecting that. Wow. I didn't realize that. Yeah. It was a huge honor. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7063.52s)]
*  There was a shot where David and Jacqueline were in the front. They looked amazing and they were [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7066.72s)]
*  kind of looking around for where to sit. And I was like, this can't be right because he must have had [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7071.76s)]
*  like a name. So it's good that it all got sorted out. But what was the vantage point from your side? [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7077.6s)]
*  Basically, you're looking out. Yeah. I mean, I was looking out and, you know, I could see the faces of [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7082.400000000001s)]
*  the Democrats as the president came out, you know, President Biden and Kamala Harris. They [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7089.76s)]
*  didn't look too happy. No, I wish they had a fixed camera on them the whole time. I wanted to see [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7093.76s)]
*  the reaction shots. I've seen some of the reaction shots, you know. Hey, Sacks, just- [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7099.12s)]
*  I mean, that was really unique to have. I mean, I thought that that speech was really incredible [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7104.88s)]
*  because, well, first of all, it was completely consistent with everything the president had said [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7110.16s)]
*  during the campaign. And so you really felt like he has a mandate here because this is everything [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7115.360000000001s)]
*  he said during the campaign. It reminded me a lot of there's that famous quote by Abraham Lincoln, [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7122.32s)]
*  that public sentiment is everything. With it, you can accomplish anything without it. You can't do [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7127.28s)]
*  anything. And it really felt like that inauguration speech was full of substance, but it was substance [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7132.32s)]
*  that the president had delivered on the campaign trail. And so when he won this victory where [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7137.679999999999s)]
*  he only won the presidency, he won the popular vote, he won seven out of seven swing states, [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7145.12s)]
*  he won the House, he won the Senate, it really feels like he has a mandate. And I think he [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7150.0s)]
*  reiterated that mandate in his speech. And then, of course, just the cherry on top is just that, [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7154.08s)]
*  you know, the losers just have to sit there and listen to it. Well, kudos to them for coming out [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7160.0s)]
*  and keeping the tradition. Yeah. Well, yeah. And when he's talking about the corrupt establishment [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7166.16s)]
*  that tried to put him in prison through this lawfare, I mean, he's talking about some of [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7171.6s)]
*  those people who are sitting behind him. I just thought it was remarkable, a remarkable moment. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7175.2s)]
*  That was a crazy visual. Do you want to take us back, Zach, on how you, because you haven't [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7179.04s)]
*  talked about this publicly, but how did you end up, I guess, getting the offer for the role, [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7183.12s)]
*  deciding to take the role, anything you want to share anecdotally on the path to get here? [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7187.36s)]
*  I don't know that there's that much to report, you know. I was helping with the transition, [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7192.8s)]
*  I got offered the role and decided to do it. So I mean, look, it's not something [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7197.2s)]
*  I was expecting or planning, as you guys know. I didn't even know there was going to be such a role, [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7201.5199999999995s)]
*  but when they decided to create it and they offered it to me and so I decided to do it. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7205.28s)]
*  You know, just one thing I should clarify just to make clear is there's still some things I can't [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7210.32s)]
*  do yet in the role because there's a whole government ethics process that you have to go [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7214.4s)]
*  through. And I'm in the midst of that process. So we've signed these EOs, it's given me [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7218.96s)]
*  certain responsibilities and authorized me to do certain things. And that process is going to begin [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7224.32s)]
*  as soon as I complete this, I guess you'd call it onboarding. So just to be clear about that, [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7228.96s)]
*  there's things I can do, there's things I can't do. I can kind of be in listening mode, I can't be [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7235.28s)]
*  necessarily shaping policy yet. So that's all going to be worked through over the next couple [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7239.599999999999s)]
*  of weeks. All right, Sax, I got to ask. First time in the Oval, what's going through your mind? [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7243.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, great question. My head was on a swivel, you know, one of those moments you're like, [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7250.639999999999s)]
*  you can't really believe that you're there. It does feel a little bit like you're on a movie set. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7254.24s)]
*  I mean, it's so famous, obviously, to be in that office. Is it bigger in person or is it smaller [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7259.28s)]
*  in person? What is it? I thought it seemed about the right size. I know that's that one of the [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7263.68s)]
*  things people say about it is that it's smaller than you expect. I didn't feel like it was smaller, [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7268.08s)]
*  but it also didn't feel bigger. It felt like, you know, the Oval Office that you've always seen. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7271.4400000000005s)]
*  The other people who are in there have been in there, the staffers who've been in there [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7275.68s)]
*  100 or 1000 times, it's obviously it wears off and it's like just where they do their work. But yeah, [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7278.8s)]
*  I've got to admit the first time you go in there, you're pretty awestruck. There was a post that JD [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7283.84s)]
*  Vance, now the vice president, had where he actually, do you guys see this? Mike Johnson. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7290.08s)]
*  I saw the video. Yeah, it's pretty crazy. He's walking in and he's in shock. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7294.96s)]
*  Because he had never been in there. I guess, you know, I guess he became a senator a few years ago [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7299.04s)]
*  and we've had a Democrat president, so he never had been to the Oval Office before. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7303.5199999999995s)]
*  And he said that he was honored and humbled to be there. I mean, that's the way I felt as well. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7307.68s)]
*  Those comments by the vice president resonated with me. I think probably every American would [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7313.12s)]
*  feel this way the first time you're in the Oval Office. It is pretty incredible. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7319.2s)]
*  You want me to repeat the words that the president said about you? [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7322.639999999999s)]
*  There's nobody like this guy. They said, how did you get David Sacks? How did you do that? [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7326.16s)]
*  He's doing it for the country more than anything else. We appreciate it, David. Thank you very much. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7331.28s)]
*  He's been really nice to me. That's really incredible. He's been just incredible to me. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7336.16s)]
*  And he gave me the pen from the signing, which is pretty cool. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7340.48s)]
*  Can we see the pen? What is the brand of the pen? [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7346.4s)]
*  Well, it's not branded. Basically, it says the White House on one side and it's got his signature [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7348.88s)]
*  on another. And so, look, I wasn't expecting any of that. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7353.4400000000005s)]
*  Is it like a Sharpie? What is that? Is it a Sharpie? [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7357.92s)]
*  It is a Sharpie. You've seen him sign, right? So I assume it's what he likes. So he gave me the pen, [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7360.4800000000005s)]
*  which is pretty incredible. Have you guys seen that there's all these [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7368.32s)]
*  ASMR videos of the president signing where you can just hear the pen on the paper? [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7371.68s)]
*  Exactly. There's like all these ASMRs of that. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7380.08s)]
*  Well, Freeberg wants to know if you could assign his new Tesla. He wants you to sign it with that [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7382.4s)]
*  pen. He wants you to autograph it. So when you get back to the valley, you can start doing [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7388.72s)]
*  autographs with that all around. Oh, no. I think only the president's allowed to use this pen. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7393.2s)]
*  Only the president's allowed to use it. Okay. Well, put it somewhere safe. Okay. Don't lose [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7399.12s)]
*  the pen. You've got to put it in a glass box or something. And, Sax, there's thousands of commenters [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7402.88s)]
*  who are just begging for you to come back. Do you have a message to your legions of commenters? [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7409.04s)]
*  Well, I thank them and I'm back right now. I know maybe it's not enough, but- [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7415.76s)]
*  Soak it in. It would help if you guys could just do [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7420.32s)]
*  a better job on the pod so they weren't complaining all the time. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7422.08s)]
*  We'll do the best we can without you. All right. Get back to work. Get back to work. Come on. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7425.44s)]
*  You're on the tax payer clock here. Go back to work here and save America. Make America great. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7430.24s)]
*  Listen, we wish you great success. We miss you greatly and we thank you for the service to the [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7437.04s)]
*  country. We wish you all the best as you go handle two of the most important issues for our country, [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7442.799999999999s)]
*  AI, and help advise our president on cryptocurrency as well. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7449.919999999999s)]
*  Love you, Sax. And PCAST. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7454.719999999999s)]
*  Congrats. And PCAST, yes, of course. And PCAST as well. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7456.08s)]
*  Boys, love you very, very much. David, love you. Hopefully, we'll see you on Tuesday. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7458.639999999999s)]
*  Yes. And Thomas, thanks for coming in. And we will see you all next time. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7463.2s)]
*  Thomas, thank you very much. You were great. Thank you. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7467.04s)]
*  Thank you, Thomas. Bye-bye. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7468.879999999999s)]
*  Love you, boys. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7471.04s)]
*  Love you, guys. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7471.599999999999s)]
*  Love you, Eskis. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7484.48s)]
*  You're a B. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7514.959999999999s)]
*  We need to get merch. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1pTCSFrkbk&t=7517.839999999999s)]
