**All In Podcast:** [August 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE)
*  Sultan of science, what's going on? Are you still riding high [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=0.0s)]
*  after your big NASA zoom interview? Your space station [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2.68s)]
*  zoom interview? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5.68s)]
*  That was really fun. Shout out to Woody Hoburg from the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6.4s)]
*  International Space Station astronaut Cal alumni. Woody [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=9.6s)]
*  listens to the pod on the ISS while he works out the astronauts [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=14.68s)]
*  workout. He said two hours and 15 minutes every day to you [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=18.68s)]
*  know, obviously your body can after if you got to work out a [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=22.28s)]
*  lot. He's like when he's working out, he listens to old episodes [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=24.32s)]
*  of the all in pod. A buddy of his put him onto it. He's become [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=26.36s)]
*  a big fan. Right on. Shout out to Woody. Yeah, I got a DM from [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=29.16s)]
*  NASA astronauts. I thought it was like some sort of scam or [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=32.84s)]
*  something. I clicked on it because I follow NASA astronauts [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=35.28s)]
*  they DM me and I'm like, obviously this astronaut wants [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=38.64s)]
*  to chat. That's so crazy. I looked the guy up seems legit. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=41.36s)]
*  He's following me on Twitter. So we did a zoom call yesterday [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=44.96s)]
*  and I put it on Twitter. The call I did with him is really [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=49.6s)]
*  fun. Honestly, like a thrill for me. An amazing individual. This [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=52.28s)]
*  guy got his PhD at Cal in computer science, did a thesis [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=57.0s)]
*  on convex optimization applied to aerospace engineering became a [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=62.52s)]
*  professor at MIT for three years and applied to the astronaut [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=65.68s)]
*  program and got in. Fast forward 2023 in March, he is the pilot [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=69.04s)]
*  of the cruise six mission, the SpaceX cruise six mission to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=75.16s)]
*  the ISS. And he's been on the ISS since March. And he's coming [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=77.76s)]
*  back in a couple of days, an incredible individual amazing [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=81.6s)]
*  story. It was super fun to chat with him. I don't think I've [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=84.76s)]
*  ever seen you smile or be more excited about anything. You [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=87.48s)]
*  look absolutely ecstatic. Oh, it was amazing. Did he have any [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=91.92s)]
*  comments on Uranus? Any thoughts on Uranus? Or no? We didn't get [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=96.36s)]
*  there. You didn't get to your ass. You blew that. Let's try [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=101.56s)]
*  that. Okay. Let me take a shot this freeburg. So did he talk [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  about going to the moon? Yeah, he's actually on the Artemis [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=108.84s)]
*  mission. And what about Uranus? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=111.08s)]
*  We didn't get that far. We didn't get that far. It was the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=115.64s)]
*  first day. It was only 20 minutes. Oh, it was the first [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=118.92s)]
*  day in 20 minutes. Did he go for Uranus? Hey, hey, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=121.56s)]
*  I hear that we're trying to actually land on the south side [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=125.8s)]
*  of the moon. The dark side of the moon. Yeah, so he's [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=130.04s)]
*  actually on it. What do you have an opinion on the dark side of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=132.28s)]
*  the moon? Or I don't know the dark side of Uranus. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=135.2s)]
*  Three for three. Three for three. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=141.08s)]
*  I just want to explain somebody was like, Why are you bullying [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=165.08s)]
*  Jake out? Why are you bullying freeburg? Tramont's bullying [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  this person. He loves the attention. Our love language is [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=170.24s)]
*  breaking chops. That's it. We like to laugh and take the piss [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=173.16s)]
*  out because everybody takes themselves too seriously. And [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=176.72s)]
*  then what's going on with the tequila? Are you guys serious [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  about this? Because I'm getting about that right now. I'm getting [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=181.68s)]
*  50 emails a day with people. All right. Let's talk about it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=183.84s)]
*  We'll talk about it. Yeah, I did run a poll asking people if [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=188.24s)]
*  they're trying all in tequila and the poll had nearly won. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  Okay, and then I ran a poll asking what the most they'd ever [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  spent on a bottle was. If you price it around 200 bucks, you [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=197.36s)]
*  can you can really maximize the man I think the demand [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  maximizing function is probably around $180 $190. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=204.04000000000002s)]
*  Right? You do not need a majority of people to want to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=207.68s)]
*  buy your tequila. You just need enough that are willing to pay [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=211.0s)]
*  the right price. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=212.88000000000002s)]
*  No, I agree. I was just trying to see how much interest to be [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  out there. And in this poll, I think it was 41% said they would [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=217.24s)]
*  try it 40% said they wouldn't. And then the remainder was this [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=222.08s)]
*  kind of, you know, show me the answer. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=225.44s)]
*  I think if we don't have advertising ever, but we have a [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=227.0s)]
*  nice sipping tequila, because you know, I don't drink a lot, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=230.64s)]
*  but I do like when sacks [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=233.2s)]
*  so nice, you look at this, guys 32,000 votes. So if you look at [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=234.96s)]
*  18.8%, so it's 79% is 200 or less. That's the sum of both of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=239.16s)]
*  those two cohorts. So like, if you price it at call it 189, you [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=245.6s)]
*  probably can get 15%. And so you know, you could probably sell [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=251.0s)]
*  several hundred thousand bottles a year. I mean, that's like a [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=255.88s)]
*  pretty real business. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=258.48s)]
*  Okay, but I need something smooth. And I like it a little [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=259.92s)]
*  sweet. Is that a problem? Can I just give you my opinion? I think [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=262.92s)]
*  that is the thing that people get wrong, just as a consumer. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=266.76s)]
*  And I think like, I'm a pretty discerning consumer. The thing [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=271.88s)]
*  that I don't like is that people focus on all this window [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=275.96s)]
*  dressing. And they don't focus on the core. And the core is [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=278.84s)]
*  that, for example, in wine, there's seven or eight rating [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=283.96s)]
*  systems. And over time, if you buy enough wine and taste enough [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=290.2s)]
*  wine, you can really figure out who's good at what. And there's [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=294.64s)]
*  just nothing that replaces a highly rated wine, it's [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=297.79999999999995s)]
*  exceptional. And that kind of discernment is now moving itself [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  into tequila. And so I would just encourage us if we're going [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=305.64s)]
*  to make a bottle, just make it an exceptionally good tasting [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=308.76s)]
*  bottle. And one of the things that I saw in the comments was [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=312.92s)]
*  that people said, Oh, you can't differentiate. But then I see [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=315.24s)]
*  some other articles like commas, which is the one that I tasted [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=318.44s)]
*  at the one and only mandarina. That was the first hundred point [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=322.2s)]
*  tequila that had ever been given out. And so there are people that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=325.64s)]
*  are starting to rate it and create these rankings. And if we [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  were going to put out a product, I would err on extreme product [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=332.8s)]
*  quality versus price point. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=336.08s)]
*  I invested in a tequila company. I showed this with you guys [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=338.28s)]
*  called 21 seeds. It was started by my friends, Nicole, Kat, and [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  Sarika. And they spent a lot of time in Mexico, finding the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=346.0s)]
*  right producer and they put fresh fruit. It's a it's a female [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=351.68s)]
*  niche tequila. So the goal is to create a tequila that will [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=355.12s)]
*  appeal to the female demographic. And they spent quite [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=358.03999999999996s)]
*  a lot of time trying to figure out how to actually get the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=361.15999999999997s)]
*  flavor of fresh fruit without using artificial flavoring into [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=363.88s)]
*  the tequila. And so there was this big investment in trying to [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=367.08s)]
*  get this thing to work. This thing worked. It took off and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=369.24s)]
*  Diageo bought the company. But it was because they spent so [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=372.0s)]
*  much time on the quality of the product that I think they were [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=375.0s)]
*  successful. And that's everyone else puts their name and label [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=377.32s)]
*  on a on a bottle of tequila and says, Hey, this is my tequila. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=380.36s)]
*  But if you don't get the quality right, Chamath is totally right. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=383.71999999999997s)]
*  People don't buy a second time, you got to get it right. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=385.91999999999996s)]
*  If you look at what Rob the Rock did, the rock went in a [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=387.68s)]
*  different direction, which is I think he has a very accessible [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=390.36s)]
*  and affordable tequila, which I think makes sense as well. It's [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=392.96s)]
*  just a different strategy. And that also works for the rock [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=396.84s)]
*  because he has almost 400 million followers. And so he can [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=399.28s)]
*  really play a volume game. But I don't think that that's what we [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=403.2s)]
*  should ever do. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=406.4s)]
*  We should stand for exceptional quality, exceptional quality. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=407.2s)]
*  And this speaks to something else, which is one of the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=409.76s)]
*  biggest points of feedback that I get. So for example, I took [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=411.96s)]
*  three days, not a night or three days, we took a little bit of a [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=414.67999999999995s)]
*  our own little honeymoon away from all the kids. And we went [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=417.91999999999996s)]
*  to Villa d'Este, just to kind of hang out in Lake Como, because I [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=420.12s)]
*  was flying out of Milan and ran into a few people there. And the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=422.84s)]
*  consistent feedback that I get from those folks is like, they [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=429.23999999999995s)]
*  love hearing about these different places, whether it's [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  different brands, different kinds of wine, all of these [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=436.88s)]
*  things, because all these folks are a little bit left out in the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=440.79999999999995s)]
*  cold now, they don't have like, how to live life well. And if [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=444.44s)]
*  you work really hard, and you're lucky enough to then also have [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=448.55999999999995s)]
*  some amount of success, why should you feel ashamed about [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=452.16s)]
*  it? Why shouldn't you be allowed to enjoy that and actually like [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=455.16s)]
*  pamper yourself and celebrate yourself and I say go for it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=458.64000000000004s)]
*  So if we can find high quality products, like this is the thing, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=462.0s)]
*  for example, like I think there's different ways of [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=466.04s)]
*  expressing success. When I was poor, I was poor in wallet. And I [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=468.92s)]
*  was also poor in mine. And then somewhere along the way, I [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=474.96000000000004s)]
*  actually became rich in wallet, but I was still poor in mind. And [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=479.4s)]
*  so I would wear these clothes that were gaudy and had huge [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=482.84s)]
*  labels. terrible, deor and Balenciaga, all this crap. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=486.2s)]
*  And the haircut looked like Friedberg's. It was disgusting. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=492.0s)]
*  Then I learned how to be rich in wallet and rich in mind, which [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=495.28s)]
*  is then you go totally brand off and you can actually find things [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=498.67999999999995s)]
*  that are just like, really well tailored, well made, they can be [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=502.12s)]
*  almost generational pieces of clothing or whatever. And I [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=505.48s)]
*  think that it's great that you can find these things and tell [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=509.6s)]
*  other people because you find that there's a latent so many [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=512.6s)]
*  number of people that want that. So at Villa d'Este as an [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=515.5600000000001s)]
*  example, that is probably the Harvard of hospitality. I've [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=517.6800000000001s)]
*  never been to a hotel that is more on point anywhere in the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=521.0s)]
*  world than that one place. Incredible, incredible ways in [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=525.04s)]
*  which say the name of the later one more time Villa d'Este Villa [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=529.16s)]
*  d'Este on Lake Coles. I'll give you one simple example Matt and [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=532.8s)]
*  I were like, talking about this one kind of olive oil and the [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=537.12s)]
*  waiter at the other table heard he went to the kitchen brought [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=541.68s)]
*  back and he said here I heard I just overheard I apologize but [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=545.8399999999999s)]
*  and I thought this is incredible you feel so pampered and loved [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=548.9599999999999s)]
*  and taken care of the level of service and quality there was [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=552.3599999999999s)]
*  incredible and I think that there are so many examples of [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=555.5999999999999s)]
*  this where if you can have elements of life, you should do [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=558.76s)]
*  it. By the way, there's a very high chance that this is where I [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=563.56s)]
*  hear all of you guys for the all in summit 2025. Okay, I'm still [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=566.4s)]
*  figuring out all the details. I'm picking 2020. But my point [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=570.52s)]
*  is whether it's Laura Piana, which is, in my opinion, the top [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=573.52s)]
*  of the top in terms of brand off really high quality clothes. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=577.0s)]
*  Look at that place. The point is like there's all these brands [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=581.6s)]
*  that exist that take enormous amounts of time to exemplify [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=584.04s)]
*  craftsmanship and care. And I think that it's appropriate for [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=588.28s)]
*  people who can participate in those experiences to be able to [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=591.88s)]
*  have them and not feel ashamed and actually like enjoy it and [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=595.12s)]
*  celebrate themselves and do it. So let's go high quality stuff, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=598.12s)]
*  not shitty big label tacky crap. Okay, Nvidia has smashed their [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=602.04s)]
*  earnings massive interest coming into this earnings report, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=605.56s)]
*  obviously, because we've been talking about Nvidia, they've [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=608.4399999999999s)]
*  had a massive run up. Everybody is trying to buy capacity to run [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=610.56s)]
*  language models, etc. self driving, yada yada. And it's not [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=615.4s)]
*  just the Googles and Amazons of the world, you have startups [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=619.24s)]
*  trying to buy H 100s, a 100s and buy this infrastructure, you [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=623.24s)]
*  also have sovereign wealth funds and countries buying these in [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=627.04s)]
*  the Middle East and Europe. And you have traditional [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=630.64s)]
*  corporations buying them. This is the blowout of world [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=632.6s)]
*  blowouts. In terms of performance, Q2 revenue 13.5 [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=634.72s)]
*  billion, up 101% year over year, that's extraordinary on that [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=639.16s)]
*  large of a number, but up 88% quarter over quarter, high [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=643.04s)]
*  growth in stocks is 2030% year over year. So this is just very [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=646.68s)]
*  uncommon, obviously, Q2 net income, $6 billion up 843% year [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=650.92s)]
*  over year, Nvidia is now worth 1.2 trillion. It's closing in on [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=657.48s)]
*  Amazon 1.4 trillion, and Google at $1.7 trillion in terms of [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=660.4s)]
*  market cap. And here's the kicker. They're printing up so [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=664.76s)]
*  much money, and so much profits rather, that the Nvidia board is [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=667.48s)]
*  approving a $25 billion share buyback. That's a very large [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=671.8s)]
*  number. In terms of share buybacks, that's six times [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=676.12s)]
*  higher than what they were currently allotted. Yeah, I [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=678.76s)]
*  guess Chamath, when you see this kind of extraordinary run up, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=681.28s)]
*  what is the ramification going to be in terms of for the [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=686.7199999999999s)]
*  industry competition, and then just trading this name? Is this [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=690.3199999999999s)]
*  peak Nvidia? Or is the peak yet to come? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=695.24s)]
*  Well, I think it's peak in one way, but this is less about a [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=697.56s)]
*  commentary on Nvidia, because they're clearly firing on all [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=700.04s)]
*  cylinders. But, you know, it's a pretty well established rule in [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=703.0799999999999s)]
*  capitalism, which is when the market observes that there's a [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=706.28s)]
*  company just printing enormous revenues and profits, they want [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=709.64s)]
*  to compete with them naturally to get their share of those [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=713.8s)]
*  revenues and profits. And that typically happens in all markets, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=716.1999999999999s)]
*  then the result of that are just decaying margins in the in the [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=720.0799999999999s)]
*  absence of a monopoly, this is what you should expect. And so, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=722.8399999999999s)]
*  because in this market, there's nothing really monopolistic [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=726.0s)]
*  about what they do, what they do is exceptional and good. But [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=728.32s)]
*  there are other ways and other systems and other companies that [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=730.9200000000001s)]
*  are developing chipsets and capabilities here to compete [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=735.24s)]
*  with Nvidia. So it probably just motivates them even more and [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=737.48s)]
*  accelerates the path where you see competition. I tweeted this [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=742.1600000000001s)]
*  out yesterday, but one of the most interesting things that [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=745.32s)]
*  could happen is somebody like Tesla decides to either open [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=747.6400000000001s)]
*  source their chip or actually starts to sell their platform [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=750.24s)]
*  because if FSD gets to a reasonable level of scale, that [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=752.5600000000001s)]
*  entire platform system is a learning and inference system [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=755.64s)]
*  for the physical world. And I think that has tremendous [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=759.12s)]
*  applications, you have something called risk V, which is an open [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=761.88s)]
*  architecture spec to essentially compete and create different [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=764.84s)]
*  versions of different chips that has implications more, I think, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=768.64s)]
*  to arm you have companies like Google that, you know, frankly, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=771.36s)]
*  spun their own silicon a long time ago, TPU, you have Amazon [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=774.0s)]
*  now talking about doing the same thing. Microsoft has invested a [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=777.4399999999999s)]
*  lot of money in FPGA technology. So it's just yet another [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=780.36s)]
*  accelerant in this trend to create many forms of AI enabled [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=785.04s)]
*  silicon. And so I think that that sort of it pulls that [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=791.12s)]
*  reality forward. And I think we're gonna have to figure out [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=795.1999999999999s)]
*  when the market prices that in because I think that that [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=797.7199999999999s)]
*  probably decays the Nvidia margin and upside over time. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=801.3199999999999s)]
*  Again, that is not a commentary on them. That's just a market [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=805.52s)]
*  reality. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=807.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, margins get competed away. For folks who don't know, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=808.76s)]
*  Tesla is making something called dojo. It's their own [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=811.7199999999999s)]
*  supercomputer. Here's a picture of it. They showed that at Tesla [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=814.2s)]
*  AI day last year. And you have arms, open source competitor is [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=817.0s)]
*  the risk five chip you're talking about, it's an open [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=822.5200000000001s)]
*  source architecture for doing large jobs. And so I guess my [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=824.88s)]
*  question to you, Friedberg is, if you look at all this [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=829.0400000000001s)]
*  capacity coming online, do you think we're going to be in a [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=831.4000000000001s)]
*  situation where the amount of capacity compute being put [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=834.5600000000001s)]
*  online is going to outstrip the need for that compute, because [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=838.2s)]
*  software is getting so much better. And then maybe, you know, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=842.28s)]
*  people are running hugging face jobs and various LMS on the new [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=845.6s)]
*  silicon from Apple, and they're running it on their m two's. And [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=849.72s)]
*  so do we need this much capacity? Are there enough [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=853.4399999999999s)]
*  interesting jobs in the world to for all this capacity? And then [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=856.1999999999999s)]
*  might that also be a headwind against Nvidia when people say, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=859.68s)]
*  you know what, I got enough, I got enough capacity here. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=863.3199999999999s)]
*  I think the rational way to think about this is to try and [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=865.36s)]
*  calculate the efficient frontier on compute use. So the more [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=869.72s)]
*  compute you use, the more it costs you. The question then is, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=876.0s)]
*  if you double the amount of compute you're using for a [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=881.28s)]
*  particular application, do you get twice the return on the [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=883.52s)]
*  investment? If you triple it, does your ROI on a percentage [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=887.48s)]
*  basis, you know, go up or go down. So at some point, you [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=892.48s)]
*  reach an efficient frontier, which is you start to see a [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=896.44s)]
*  declining or negative rate of return on the investment in the [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=899.56s)]
*  compute that you're using for a particular application. And this [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=903.0799999999999s)]
*  is certainly going to be application and market specific, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=906.1999999999999s)]
*  it's going to be largely driven by the data that is available in [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=908.4799999999999s)]
*  that market to do training to do tuning, the market's appetite to [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=911.4399999999999s)]
*  spend money for that particular set of applications that emerges [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=915.3199999999999s)]
*  from that compute that's being used. And so we don't know today [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=919.3199999999999s)]
*  where the efficient frontier is across each of these different [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=924.16s)]
*  markets and sets of applications. And the market is [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=927.8s)]
*  finding that out. In the process of finding that out, everyone is [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=930.52s)]
*  spending a shit ton of money on compute. And they are trying to [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=934.3199999999999s)]
*  get as many server racks as they can. They're trying to get as [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=937.64s)]
*  many chipsets as they can, they're trying to get as much [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=940.92s)]
*  server time as they can. And everyone's got this idea that the [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=944.3199999999999s)]
*  more compute I can throw it a problem. The return is going to [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=947.4399999999999s)]
*  scale linearly. And it turns out that like with most most things, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=951.9599999999999s)]
*  the answer is likely not. So we're at this point right now, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=954.56s)]
*  and I would argue a bit of a cycle that the there looks to be [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=959.64s)]
*  a bubble. And what I mean by that is that there's a lot of [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=964.76s)]
*  inefficient spending going on, as the efficient frontiers are [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=967.16s)]
*  discovered across all these different application sets. And [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=970.88s)]
*  so my intuition without a lot of actual data to back this up, is [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=973.92s)]
*  that based just anecdotally on what I'm hearing people doing in [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=979.0s)]
*  the market, what companies are doing, what startups are doing, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=981.92s)]
*  etc. Everyone is throwing everything they can compute, and [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=984.0s)]
*  they're going to realize that they're going to need to [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=987.92s)]
*  rationalize those expenses at some time at some point. So I [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=989.12s)]
*  would I would envision Nvidia is probably writing a writing a [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=992.16s)]
*  little bit of a discovery of the efficient frontier wave right [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=995.24s)]
*  now. And that this probably is not necessarily steady state. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=998.36s)]
*  Sax, we experienced this before. As you remember from the dot com [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1002.28s)]
*  era, there was a massive investment very similar to this [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1006.76s)]
*  in fiber, and the overspending of building the fiber [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1010.24s)]
*  infrastructure so everybody could get broadband, and they [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1013.76s)]
*  could stream movies, etc. happened in that 97 to 2002 time [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1016.64s)]
*  period. A lot of those companies went out of business, a lot of [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1022.0s)]
*  that fiber never got used. People were working on [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1024.56s)]
*  compression algorithms while they were building on massive [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1027.08s)]
*  fiber. And a lot of that fiber got sold. I think Google bought [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1029.4s)]
*  up a lot of it, other people bought it up. And it was just a [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1031.82s)]
*  massive overspend. So is this like the dark fiber of this era [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1034.76s)]
*  where we're just going to build so much capacity, that there's [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1039.08s)]
*  just going to be not enough jobs to run on it in your mind? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1042.48s)]
*  Well, I think it's a little different than fiber in the [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1045.44s)]
*  sense that every year, there's gonna be a new generation of [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1047.24s)]
*  chips. And so these cloud providers who are providing GPU [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1049.6s)]
*  compute, they're going to want to keep upgrading the chips to be [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1056.02s)]
*  able to address the next generation of applications. So I [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1058.94s)]
*  don't think it's quite as static as fiber where you kind of build [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1061.84s)]
*  it once. And you're right that there was kind of a glut of [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1064.72s)]
*  capacity was created. Eventually, though, the internet [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1067.84s)]
*  usage grew into that capacity. But I think this is a little [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1070.66s)]
*  different because again, you're going to need to upgrade the [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1073.78s)]
*  chips every year or two. I think Freeburg is right that this is [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1075.7s)]
*  clearly a spike in demand that may not be sustainable. I mean, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1078.94s)]
*  recall what happened here is that chat GPT launched on [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1083.66s)]
*  November 30 last year, and really caught everyone by [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1086.98s)]
*  surprise, it kind of took the world by storm. And over the [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1090.38s)]
*  next few months, you had hundreds of millions of users [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1093.22s)]
*  discover AI, I think it surprised even the open AI team. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1095.5400000000002s)]
*  I think when they launched chat GPT, they thought it'd be more [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1099.5s)]
*  of a proof of concept. But it ended up being a lot more than [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1101.9s)]
*  that. And so everyone has scrambled all of a sudden, in [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1105.54s)]
*  the last nine months or so to develop their own AI strategy. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1108.98s)]
*  And so, again, it was this giant platform shift that happened [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1113.38s)]
*  overnight. So there is a tremendous GPU shortage right [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1116.94s)]
*  now. And that's also what's leading to these almost [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1121.18s)]
*  software like profit margins by Nvidia, because when everyone's [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1125.54s)]
*  clamoring to get a limited supply of these chips, and there [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1129.46s)]
*  just aren't enough Nvidia can almost charge whatever they [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1133.26s)]
*  want. And so I think even more than the demand, the profit [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1135.82s)]
*  margins might not be sustainable. But I think the [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1139.34s)]
*  reality is, we just don't know what the steady state of demand [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1143.02s)]
*  in this market is going to be. I think we can say that it can't [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1146.22s)]
*  continue at these growth rates. But probably there will be some [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1150.62s)]
*  steady state of demand that's, you know, probably is at least [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1154.5s)]
*  where we are today. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1157.82s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think it's perfectly analogous Chamath. But [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1159.18s)]
*  just to, to bring up some historical context, check out [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1161.78s)]
*  this article I was reading the other day, the dimensions of the [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1165.26s)]
*  collapse of the telecommunications industry. This [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1167.82s)]
*  is August 2002. And it says, the dimension of the collapse in the [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1169.54s)]
*  telecommunications industry during the past two years has [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1174.78s)]
*  have been staggering half a million people have lost their [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1176.7s)]
*  jobs. And that time the Dow Jones communication technology [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1178.86s)]
*  index has dropped 86% the wireless communication index 89% [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1181.06s)]
*  these are declines in value worthy of comparison to the great [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1185.26s)]
*  crash of 1929 out of the 7 trillion decline in the stock [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1187.7s)]
*  market since its peak about 2 trillion have disappeared in the [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1191.26s)]
*  capitalization of telecom companies 23 telecom companies [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1194.26s)]
*  have gone bankrupt in a wave capped off by the July 21 collapse [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1197.26s)]
*  of worldcom the single largest bankruptcy in American history. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1200.8999999999999s)]
*  So just a little history there of this, it's not perfectly [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1203.8999999999999s)]
*  analogous. Obviously, when Nvidia is not going bankrupt or [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1206.74s)]
*  anything like that, but this over capacity issue is definitely [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1210.18s)]
*  going to be something but you had mentioned that in one of your [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1212.78s)]
*  tweet storms in the past couple of weeks, or these long form [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1216.46s)]
*  that you're doing on x, previously known as Twitter, you [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1218.8600000000001s)]
*  mentioned that what are the jobs that could be pushed to this [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1222.66s)]
*  compute? And what if one of them works? I think you were doing a [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1226.02s)]
*  speaking gig that somebody tweeted out a little clip of. So [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1229.26s)]
*  let's unpack that. What do you think are some jobs that people [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1232.6200000000001s)]
*  might push here that we don't anticipate that could solve [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1235.22s)]
*  something miraculous in the world? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1238.06s)]
*  Well, they had the framing is really like if you if you go [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1240.18s)]
*  back to like the the gold rush of the 1800s in San Francisco, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1243.54s)]
*  the people that made the money were the platform enablers, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1247.66s)]
*  right? They were the ones that sold the picks, the shovels, the [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1250.06s)]
*  pans and the jeans. Right. And that's where that's really by [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1252.34s)]
*  Strauss was born the the equivalent analogy. The [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1255.54s)]
*  equivalence in that analogy today is Nvidia, because they [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1258.86s)]
*  are the dominant pick and shovel provider. So the question is, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1263.26s)]
*  well, what are we going to use these picks and shovels to [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1267.3s)]
*  create? Are we going to find gold? And I think the question [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1269.98s)]
*  is unclear. And where will that gold be found? Will it be found [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1272.46s)]
*  inside of a big tech company? Or will it be found inside of a [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1275.7s)]
*  startup? If you look inside of where these resources are being [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1278.4199999999998s)]
*  used inside of big tech, it is to completely scorch the earth [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1281.78s)]
*  on the economic value of large models. And I think that that's [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1286.62s)]
*  very, very good for all of the startups that come after it. So [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1290.54s)]
*  what do I mean by this? You know, we were also wrapped [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1294.54s)]
*  around the axle around chat GPT, and then GPT in general. And now, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1297.54s)]
*  you know, if you look at the quality of llama, llama to [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1303.94s)]
*  basically these big companies have decided, no, we're just [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1307.98s)]
*  going to make all these models extremely good, extremely useful [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1310.74s)]
*  and very, very free. And so a lot of the resources are going [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1315.3s)]
*  there to subsidize economically subsidized and by implication, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1319.1s)]
*  economically destroy the value of that category, that's going [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1323.34s)]
*  to be good for startups. And so the question is, what will you [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1327.5s)]
*  then build on top of these quasi free, almost free tools? And so [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1331.4599999999998s)]
*  one area that I have been looking at for a while is in [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1337.74s)]
*  computational biology, I think that that clip that you're [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1340.3s)]
*  talking about was just me talking with orange Eve, just [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1342.3799999999999s)]
*  around the ability to compute large complex spaces with very [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1346.4199999999998s)]

*  But tomorrow in an AI model that you can train, you can literally [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1355.1799999999998s)]
*  characterize every single molecular permutation you can [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1358.78s)]
*  imagine. You combine it with something like alpha fold, and [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1361.3s)]
*  you can understand protein folding, and all of a sudden, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1364.4199999999998s)]
*  you can sequentially start to put tools together that could [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1366.3s)]
*  theoretically give you much higher probability guessing for [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1368.86s)]
*  specific compounds that could actually cure disease. A [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1374.4199999999998s)]
*  different version of that is a company that myself and a few [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1378.34s)]
*  other people started, I tweeted that out, which is more in the [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1381.42s)]
*  material science space. And we've had some pretty important [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1384.1000000000001s)]
*  breakthroughs there, which is really about trying to invent [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1386.8200000000002s)]
*  next generation battery materials. And we have one [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1389.9s)]
*  candidate that could be pretty revolutionary, if it turns out to [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1393.22s)]
*  work, we don't know yet some positive signs. So there are [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1397.42s)]
*  there are some of these green shoots. So my perspective is [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1401.5800000000002s)]
*  that a lot of the money that Nvidia makes today is going to [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1404.14s)]
*  be money well spent, because it'll be going to the big guys, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1407.18s)]
*  big tech plus Tesla, they are then going to create some really [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1410.9s)]
*  foundational platform technologies with it, whether [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1416.22s)]
*  it's dojo, whether it's FSD, whether it's the full platform [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1419.8600000000001s)]
*  inside of Tesla, that is the cameras plus the inference plus [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1423.5400000000002s)]
*  the training for all forms of physical world interaction, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1426.46s)]
*  whether it's llama two, and all of that stuff will be given away [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1429.5800000000002s)]
*  essentially, I think, open source quasi free to the [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1432.94s)]
*  ecosystem over the next few years. And I think that will be [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1436.5800000000002s)]
*  a really important moment, which will create hundreds of [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1439.98s)]
*  new companies doing really clever, cool things. So we [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1444.26s)]
*  haven't yet seen the big breakout company yet. And so I [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1447.8600000000001s)]
*  think that right now most of this capex is going to the big [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1451.74s)]
*  guys. But the dividends of all the work that these big guys are [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1454.1s)]
*  doing will be seen over the next few years in the startups that [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1459.42s)]
*  get started in the next four or five years. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1463.42s)]
*  I love the California analogy. Ultimately, what all that [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1465.6200000000001s)]
*  prospecting for gold did was create the state of California, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1468.38s)]
*  putting aside the Levi's and the jeans. And if you know anything [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1471.98s)]
*  about California's GDP, it would be Yeah, I think these statistics [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1475.38s)]
*  are always talked about fifth, 10th, eighth largest as a bigger [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1481.34s)]
*  GDP California than some of the largest countries in the world. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1485.1000000000001s)]
*  So this is a 2015 chart. It's hard to find the updated [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1488.9s)]
*  information on this. But ultimately, that was the product [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1492.34s)]
*  of the gold rush is this incredible state. Any other [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1494.66s)]
*  thoughts on Nvidia before we move on to arm? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1496.86s)]
*  I think open AI had a potentially significant product [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1499.54s)]
*  announcement that's related to this. So they just launched [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1502.9399999999998s)]
*  fine tuning for chat GPT actually version 3.5 turbo says [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1507.1399999999999s)]
*  here fine tuning lets you train the model and your company's [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1513.06s)]
*  data run at scale early tests have shown that fine tune GPT [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1515.22s)]
*  3.5 can match or exceed GPT four on narrow tasks. So you can do [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1519.4199999999998s)]
*  things like fine tune the formatting of the output, you [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1523.7s)]
*  can fine tune the tone, fine tuning also allows businesses [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1529.14s)]
*  to make the model follow instructions better. So I think [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1532.78s)]
*  the point of this is that we're still at such an early stage of [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1536.6200000000001s)]
*  this. And there are so many applications that are going to [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1539.9s)]
*  be developed, and they're making the models more and more useful. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1543.18s)]
*  So Jason, to your analogy about fiber, what happened with fiber [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1546.98s)]
*  is there was a big build out of over capacity, but then the [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1550.6599999999999s)]
*  number of applications kept growing until that capacity got [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1554.9799999999998s)]
*  used. And I think we're probably going to see something like that [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1558.1399999999999s)]
*  here where there is a big build out going on of capacity, but [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1560.7399999999998s)]
*  and capabilities, and that's going to lead to the next [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1564.4199999999998s)]
*  generation of applications. And I just think we don't know yet [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1566.62s)]
*  what the steady state of either demand or supply for these chips [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1570.7399999999998s)]
*  is going to be. Obviously, the market got taken by surprise [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1574.3s)]
*  over the last year, so you've seen, again, this huge spike in [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1578.18s)]
*  demand, the supply cannot react fast enough. That's led to [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1581.54s)]
*  gigantic profits for Nvidia. But it's hard to know exactly again, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1584.78s)]
*  what is the steady state going to be? Is it going to be like [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1588.7s)]
*  this? Or is this a one time spike? And we also don't know [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1590.66s)]
*  what the supply will be once the manufacturers all adjust, because [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1593.9s)]
*  now they know that the demand is there. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1597.46s)]
*  And to your point, like the the big use cases are pushing us [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1599.0600000000002s)]
*  well passed chips to really be more like entire systems, and [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1603.34s)]
*  these racks. And so if you look like at Grace Hopper, which is [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1608.1s)]
*  their next gen design, it's like a bunch of chiplets plus memory [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1610.74s)]
*  on a huge board. It's not a chip, you're talking about [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1614.8999999999999s)]
*  system level manufacturing at this point. And that will also [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1618.6599999999999s)]
*  create different kinds of use cases. Because for example, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1621.9399999999998s)]
*  today, right now, when you look at simple things like probabilistic [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1625.1s)]
*  tasks, I think chat GPT and all these GPTs are, are pretty [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1627.6999999999998s)]
*  marvelous and pretty inspirational. But deterministic [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1631.34s)]
*  tasks, they're shit, like, you know, they hallucinate on simple [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1634.34s)]
*  things like multiplication. Why? Because you infer multiplication [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1637.3799999999999s)]
*  and you try to calculate it probabilistically, and you get [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1640.4199999999998s)]
*  these simple math functions wrong. And so these are all [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1643.02s)]
*  these things where the software has to become more and more [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1646.1s)]
*  sophisticated, and actually be able to path and tunnel code into [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1648.78s)]
*  different ways of getting it executed, and then bringing it [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1652.6599999999999s)]
*  back and stitching it together. All of these things don't exist. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1654.86s)]
*  Those are very rudimentary things that were solved in V1 of [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1658.26s)]
*  compute. So I think that to your point, David, like, we don't [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1661.22s)]
*  know where this goes. We're probably going to go to a place [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1664.74s)]
*  that it's not just about chips, but it's about systems. But [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1668.58s)]
*  that's going to create this weird balkanization almost. And [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1672.26s)]
*  I think that's where a lot of the profit margins will get [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1676.9s)]
*  eroded away, because that will make it a much more competitive [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1679.6200000000001s)]
*  industry. And there just isn't a lot of margin to capture when [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1684.14s)]
*  you actually stitch all these things together. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1687.9s)]
*  Yeah. And if you think about what were the massive wins for [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1689.7s)]
*  all that extra fiber, it was really two companies. The first [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1694.22s)]
*  was YouTube, which stopped charging people for transport on [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1697.6599999999999s)]
*  their videos before that if you had a video go viral, your server [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1700.94s)]
*  got shut down because you hit your $5,000 a month limit or [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1704.5s)]
*  whatever you had set with your ISP. And then Netflix, of [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1708.46s)]
*  course, right, Netflix couldn't exist and all that dark fiber [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1711.26s)]
*  built that so we'll see with all this extra GPU, what could [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1713.82s)]
*  happen? And to your point about the the breakthroughs there, you [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1716.1s)]
*  can now go into your chat GPT and you can put in custom [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1719.6999999999998s)]
*  instructions. And so it asks you what would you like chat GPT to [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1725.5s)]
*  know about you and provide better responses. And you know, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1728.54s)]
*  for example, I told it I'm a venture capitalist, I live in [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1732.82s)]
*  the Bay Area, I'm looking for concise business information. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1735.02s)]
*  And then it says, Well, how do you like how would you like chat [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1739.86s)]
*  GPT to respond? And I said, I like to see data in a table. I [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1742.34s)]
*  like to see data in those tables with hyperlinks. I like [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1745.62s)]
*  citations when possible. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1748.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, just to be clear, what you're describing with custom [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1749.3799999999999s)]
*  instructions, that was a feature I think they launched like a [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1751.54s)]
*  month or two ago. And what that is doing is prompt engineering. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1753.82s)]
*  Basically, it's pre saving, like all that preamble that you [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1757.54s)]
*  would have to put in every single one of your prompts. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1761.4199999999998s)]
*  Yep. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1763.86s)]
*  Whereas this fine tuning, as I understand it is more about [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1764.1399999999999s)]
*  fine tuning the model to your to improve the model for a certain [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1767.26s)]
*  kind of data or certain kind of output. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1770.6599999999999s)]
*  Right. So the example there would be if you had your email [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1772.26s)]
*  box, or you had your Google Docs, or you had a repository of [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1775.34s)]
*  all your slack messages or something in your company, you [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1778.3s)]
*  have your company handbooks, or, you know, all of Chemoc's [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1780.54s)]
*  letters he writes every year, you could have that uploaded to [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1783.78s)]
*  chat GPT. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1786.4599999999998s)]
*  It's potentially very powerful, I think for enterprises, I think [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1786.98s)]
*  the big enterprise use case, the most obvious one is that every [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1791.06s)]
*  enterprise wants its own internal chatbot, it wants its [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1794.62s)]
*  own internal chat GPT, where the employees can ask questions and [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1797.78s)]
*  the AI has access to all the company's information and it [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1803.5s)]
*  understands permissions and privacy. So it only reveals [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1806.3s)]
*  information to people who have the right to see it. That's kind [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1808.8999999999999s)]
*  of a tall order. But I think that's what the market wants. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1812.06s)]
*  Yeah, they want the chat GPT for the company intranet. Yes. And [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1814.3s)]
*  so I think there's a lot of people racing to provide that. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1818.1799999999998s)]
*  And there was an interesting tweet by Nathan Benach. Anyway, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1820.54s)]
*  he just said bye bye a bunch of startups. So I guess a lot of [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1824.6599999999999s)]
*  stars were working on this fine tuning problem that may be too [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1827.34s)]
*  glib. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1829.58s)]
*  Reaction, because I think there's just a lot of [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1830.74s)]
*  enterprises who do not want to share all their corporate [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1832.7s)]
*  information with open AI. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1835.34s)]
*  Of course, what if it's HR information, and you have people [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1836.9s)]
*  asking like, who are the most overpaid people in this company? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1839.26s)]
*  You know, what if it's like the badge information and how many [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1841.7s)]
*  hours people are working? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1844.1399999999999s)]
*  Or that's more about permissions, Jason, but even if [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1845.1399999999999s)]
*  open AI can nail the permissions problem. I think there's just a [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1847.34s)]
*  lot of enterprises who will not want to trust their data to [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1849.98s)]
*  open AI. They're gonna be afraid about where it goes. This is why [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1852.82s)]
*  I think open source is taking off in a big way is that I think [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1855.86s)]
*  big enterprises would much rather roll their own models and [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1859.34s)]
*  control it and do the fine tuning. And that's why they're [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1862.4599999999998s)]
*  using tools like mosaic and hugging faces, they want to have [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1864.4199999999998s)]
*  control over it themselves. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1867.82s)]
*  That's an excellent point. And that has implications as well [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1869.02s)]
*  into the hardware, which is also probably a good jumping off [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1871.8999999999999s)]
*  point for ARM, because this that what you said is exactly must [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1874.3799999999999s)]
*  happen for the integrity of an organization to want to use [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1877.6599999999999s)]
*  these things. And if that happens, then it just further [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1881.34s)]
*  further accelerates, I think, how the hardware will get [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1885.1799999999998s)]
*  abstracted, and frankly, quasi open sourced as well. All right, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1888.14s)]
*  let's talk Facebook did a great job of this. Because like, when [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1891.7800000000002s)]
*  Facebook was building data centers, they had to invent [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1894.26s)]
*  tremendous capabilities that didn't exist before. And the [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1898.26s)]
*  market was really fragmented, it was very expensive. And what [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1901.7800000000002s)]
*  they did was they basically created these reference designs [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1904.26s)]
*  for servers and blades and the whole nine yards and open source [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1907.14s)]
*  the whole thing. And it just, you know, in essence, destroyed a [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1910.0600000000002s)]
*  market, but it created a hyper efficient market that then [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1914.3400000000001s)]
*  everybody could use. And I think the question is that if [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1917.3s)]
*  it's happening at the software layer already now, just like it [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1921.3s)]
*  did in web two software, and then we see certain elements of [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1924.26s)]
*  web two hardware been open sourced, I think it makes [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1929.02s)]
*  pretty logical sense that you can expect the same things to [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1932.54s)]
*  happen in the AI world. The AI models and the AI platforms and [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1934.98s)]
*  the AI all of that stuff will first get open source because [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1939.02s)]
*  it's a data integrity security issue. And then the hardware [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1941.58s)]
*  will get open source as well, because you just want simple [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1945.42s)]
*  reference designs you can use and plug and play. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1947.98s)]
*  Yeah, if you want to look at that, it's called the open [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1950.9s)]
*  compute project open compute.org. Just a way to use [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1953.3000000000002s)]
*  open source to grind down the prices take out the margin, I [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1957.46s)]
*  guess is what you're saying, Chema, to make all these data [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1960.14s)]
*  centers scale, right? Well, so [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1963.8600000000001s)]
*  you know, so one related story here is this just happened in [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1966.8600000000001s)]
*  the last few weeks, there's a company called core weave, which [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1970.3000000000002s)]
*  provides cloud infrastructure for AI training, it's secured a [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1974.18s)]
*  $2.3 billion investment in the form of a loan. What core weave [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1977.1000000000001s)]
*  is trying to do, it's kind of like AWS, but for GPUs. So [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1981.14s)]
*  essentially, instead of having to buy your own GPUs, in order [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1986.38s)]
*  to, you know, set up your own infrastructure, you just [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1990.5s)]
*  basically rent compute from these guys. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1993.18s)]
*  But this is this is exactly why like none of these, none of these [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1996.64s)]
*  companies will really be allowed to exist in this exact way for [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=1999.26s)]
*  five years from now, because ultimately, what people want is [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2002.14s)]
*  massive throughput, right? tokens per second, give me as [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2004.8200000000002s)]
*  many tokens per second as possible. And they don't [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2007.38s)]
*  particularly care. Again, if you understand the model, do they [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2010.66s)]
*  really care what the underlying substrate hardware should be? It [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2014.22s)]
*  doesn't seem like they should, they should care what is the [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2017.14s)]
*  throughput? What do I pay for it? And by the way, that is exactly [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2019.8200000000002s)]
*  what happened when AWS really start to scale. Because if you [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2023.22s)]
*  guys remember, when we started for subtract code into AWS, what [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2025.8200000000002s)]
*  do we care about? How much did an EC two instance cost? How [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2029.14s)]
*  much did an S3 bucket cost? And that's all we cared about. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2031.8200000000002s)]
*  Because that abstraction allowed us to not care about the [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2034.8600000000001s)]
*  underlying hardware who was the vendor, what was the configuration, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2037.9s)]
*  it didn't matter. And so in an interesting way, we're going to [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2042.2s)]
*  go through that same evolution here, because it's just [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2045.0200000000002s)]
*  economically rational that that kind of market exists, you [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2047.22s)]
*  should only care tokens per second, I think. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2050.94s)]
*  All right, in other news, oh, by the way, there's something [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2053.6600000000003s)]
*  called common crawl, which is another interesting open source [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2056.46s)]
*  project that is getting a lot more attention today, because [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2059.42s)]
*  they have crawled the web and you can use this common crawl, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2062.9s)]
*  they release it monthly. And that's what a lot of people are [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2065.3s)]
*  training their data on. Now they don't have permission from all [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2068.26s)]
*  those people to do training data. But they do have the [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2071.68s)]
*  ability for you download an open crawl, essentially what Google [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2075.18s)]
*  has, and you have a an open source version of it. So [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2078.7s)]
*  common crawl was started and funded by Gil Elba's. Yeah, he's [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2082.1400000000003s)]
*  a he's a friend. Gil sold his company applied semantics to [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2086.6600000000003s)]
*  Google back in oh 203. And a big part of his effort with common [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2090.5800000000004s)]
*  crawl is to [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2098.02s)]
*  is it adsense for adsense. So basically applied semantics [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2100.94s)]
*  could read a web page, and then create the keywords associated [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2106.54s)]
*  with the content on that web page. And then those keywords [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2111.02s)]
*  would trigger AdWords ads on the on the web page, they called it [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2113.22s)]
*  adsense. So adsense started, and the whole publisher network at [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2115.58s)]
*  Google was born from the applied semantics acquisition. And Gil [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2118.46s)]
*  was obviously a pretty significant shareholder of [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2122.98s)]
*  Google. He's even in the S1 as one of the major shareholders. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2125.34s)]
*  He's a really great human being. And his intention with this [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2129.1s)]
*  common crawl project was, you know, to make the crawling of [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2132.66s)]
*  the web the index, and the caching available for all these [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2135.9s)]
*  different projects that might exist. And he didn't at the time [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2139.98s)]
*  anticipate the the open AI application becoming you know, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2142.86s)]
*  the big breakthrough. But when GPT three was published, I think [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2147.98s)]
*  they said that 80 plus percent of the waiting came from the [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2151.3s)]
*  content out of common crawl. And so it's really been this a this [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2156.18s)]
*  amazing project completely nonprofit, all funded mostly [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2159.3s)]
*  funded by Gil, and has really unlocked this opportunity for a [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2163.22s)]
*  lot of the open source alternatives to now try and [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2167.38s)]
*  provide solutions that can exist and coexist with open AI and [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2170.34s)]
*  others in the commercial options in the world. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2174.46s)]
*  A small piece of trivia. We were one of the first adsense [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2176.86s)]
*  publishers. And so here's a story from October of 2005. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2180.46s)]
*  Weblogs Inc, which didn't gadget the blogging company I started [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2184.9s)]
*  hit $3,000 a day in adsense, thanks to Gil and the team over [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2188.02s)]
*  there. And we wound up selling it to us. And this is the story [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2191.42s)]
*  about it. And and we were in the S one, they had two examples [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2195.1s)]
*  of publishers, one was New York Times. And then one was Weblogs [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2199.42s)]
*  Inc, they show like an upstart and this one has a lot of history [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2202.98s)]
*  here. And it's fun to go back down to and we were we were in [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2206.7s)]
*  the s one for the way Google [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2209.66s)]
*  Gil was going to be at the summit. So [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2210.98s)]
*  I'm gonna give him a hug and take a picture. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2213.66s)]

*  grandson to Google me and notice that I did some things and then [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2227.02s)]
*  we can talk about it. Yeah, and Jay, Jay, I had this thought for [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2230.8199999999997s)]

*  that you're a part of. Yeah, hopefully your your grandkids [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2238.42s)]

*  tweeted an episode with Gary Tan from 2009 that I recorded at [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2247.98s)]
*  Sequoia's office. And I just put it on the this week in [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2252.86s)]
*  startups quarter accounts pretty funny to have babyface Gary Tan [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2255.82s)]
*  from posterous on there. All right arm officially filed it's [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2258.6600000000003s)]
*  f1. It's kind of like an s one for a foreign company. And they [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2261.1800000000003s)]
*  plan to go public next month arms revenue last quarter 675 [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2264.34s)]
*  million down 2% year over year up 7% quarter over quarter [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2268.5s)]
*  fiscal full year 2023 2.7 billion ish down 1% year over [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2272.58s)]
*  year. Farms major business just so you know is smartphones 99% [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2277.78s)]
*  of smartphones are built with arms chip architecture embedded [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2282.74s)]
*  systems they have embedded systems systems. Yeah, we'll get [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2286.3799999999997s)]
*  into it. The problem is the market is totally moving when [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2289.06s)]
*  when softbank bought arm. It was probably like the last year [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2291.1s)]
*  where you know, there was so much focus on the hardware and [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2294.3799999999997s)]
*  platform technologies inside of mobile and tablets and all that [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2298.58s)]
*  stuff. But in these last few years, think of what's happened. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2301.9399999999996s)]
*  We've had a massive shift to AI. Right. And so that's pushing a [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2305.2599999999998s)]
*  lot more pressure on GPUs and whatever comes after that. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2309.3799999999997s)]
*  We have had a reemergence of the popularity of risk V, which is [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2312.8999999999996s)]
*  an open source competitor to arm. We have had Apple in [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2317.18s)]
*  source, a whole bunch of their own architectural decisions in [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2320.74s)]
*  silicon design because they don't want the dependency. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2323.8999999999996s)]
*  They have a tiny philosophy. Yeah, well, also, they also care [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2326.4199999999996s)]
*  about different things like they care about battery life. So [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2329.4199999999996s)]
*  that's why that's the focus of their chip architecture. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2331.66s)]
*  And so all of this just means that that market embedded [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2334.4599999999996s)]
*  systems becomes more and more constrained and commoditized [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2337.8199999999997s)]
*  over time, which again, as we said, in capitalism means that [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2342.74s)]
*  future profits will be less than historical profits. And so I [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2346.4599999999996s)]
*  think this is a very tough valuation to get right. And [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2350.2599999999998s)]
*  trying to stretch to a 60 or $70 billion print I think is really [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2355.7799999999997s)]
*  tough. This is a honestly a 15 to $20 billion company. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2359.66s)]
*  Ouch. So question for you, I'll open it up to to the Davids. Why [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2364.2999999999997s)]
*  would SoftBank I know the answer, but I'm asking you so [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2370.02s)]
*  you can explain to the audience. Why would SoftBank take a [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2373.1s)]
*  company public with these headwinds with no growth being [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2376.74s)]
*  flat? Why are they taking the public now? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2380.46s)]
*  Well, SoftBank has the D lever, right? They have a they have a [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2383.42s)]
*  very big problem, which is that they have this forget SoftBank [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2386.78s)]
*  Vision Fund for a second, but SoftBank itself is a telco [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2391.02s)]
*  operator that has ginormous piles of debt that they've used [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2394.9s)]
*  to finance the building of their business. And so when you have [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2398.86s)]
*  contraction in your core business, you become more and [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2402.82s)]
*  more at risk of breaching the covenants of all that debt and [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2406.94s)]
*  or you just like run out of free cash flow, like all of these [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2409.6600000000003s)]
*  things really hurt your future ability to invest. And so SoftBank [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2412.5s)]
*  is under a lot of pressure to just clean up the balance sheet [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2416.7000000000003s)]
*  and D lever. And so when you have an asset like this sitting [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2419.46s)]
*  there, if you can sell, you know, 20 or $30 billion of that, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2422.98s)]
*  call it to somebody, and then replenish your balance sheet, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2428.38s)]
*  that provides tremendous liquidity and relief. And they [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2433.6600000000003s)]
*  did that as well. A few months ago with Alibaba, they've [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2436.82s)]
*  started to, I think now they may have sold out of the overwhelming [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2439.98s)]
*  majority of the position in Alibaba, again, because they have [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2443.7400000000002s)]
*  massive liquidity needs because they have so much debt. So this [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2446.38s)]
*  is just part and parcel of them D levering the balance sheet. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2451.62s)]
*  So they're forced to get it out is I guess what you're saying. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2454.1800000000003s)]
*  And then we've talked sacks a little bit about other companies [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2456.42s)]
*  that are going to be forced. They're on the what do they call [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2460.62s)]
*  it when you're on a pirate ship, they make you walk the plank. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2463.7400000000002s)]
*  I'd say this is like the walking of the plank to an IPO, you got [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2466.42s)]
*  other companies that have issues where they just have to get [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2469.38s)]
*  public at some point. So maybe the public markets are going to [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2472.58s)]
*  open up. And in some cases, it's going to be because people are [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2476.2200000000003s)]
*  walking the plank or the cases, it's going to be opportunistic. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2480.38s)]
*  So maybe you could talk a little bit about your thoughts on that. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2482.46s)]
*  I think it's hard to walk the plank into the public markets. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2484.22s)]
*  I'm not sure exactly what you mean by that, because the public [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2486.46s)]
*  markets have to want to buy your issuance. So if it's not a good [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2488.46s)]
*  company, then you know, in this environment, they're not gonna [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2492.22s)]
*  be able to IPO. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2494.7s)]
*  Well, they're gonna be able to API. I think the question is the [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2495.94s)]
*  price. They have no choice but to get so yeah, there may be a [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2497.62s)]
*  lot of down rounds into an IPO from the last private round, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2500.74s)]
*  which was two or three times what the IPO price is going to [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2504.2599999999998s)]
*  be. Maybe what you mean by walk the plank is that will you tell [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2506.54s)]
*  me but there are a lot of companies which have built up [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2511.26s)]
*  huge pref stacks because they raise too much money at the peak [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2514.46s)]
*  at valuations are too high. And going public does allow you to [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2517.98s)]
*  reset your whole pref stack because all the preferred with [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2522.0200000000004s)]
*  all the rights and preferences converts to common. So post IPO [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2525.26s)]
*  you just have common. And so it is a way to like clear out all [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2528.86s)]
*  the structure and all the mess that has built up in a company [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2534.0600000000004s)]
*  and you can get to a real valuation that reflects basically [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2536.94s)]
*  the truth of what the company is worth. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2541.42s)]
*  Another analogy might be the house is on fire, you got it, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2542.9s)]
*  you're on the balcony, you got to jump, or you got to stay in [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2545.14s)]
*  the burning building. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2547.42s)]
*  Yeah, but you know, listen, if your company's on fire, I don't [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2548.1s)]
*  think you're gonna be able to IPO. I mean, it's it's gonna be [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2550.2200000000003s)]
*  a tough scrutinizing public market for new offerings. I [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2552.78s)]
*  think that the scenario in which you can IPO is if the company is [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2557.58s)]
*  fundamentally good, it will be able to IPO at some valuation [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2562.3s)]
*  and that valuation may be a significant down round from [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2566.3s)]
*  their last private round, those will be able to get out. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2568.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and that's right. I guess. Now, are you seeing? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2572.26s)]
*  It could be Stripe. Yeah. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2575.02s)]
*  Are you seeing David, the M&A activity starting to bubble up [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2576.3s)]
*  in your portfolio or in you know, the back channels, because [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2580.26s)]
*  I'm starting to see that a bit. founders are packing it in, in [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2582.82s)]
*  some instances and saying, you know what, we want to try for [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2586.54s)]
*  M&A. Or, you know, some companies are getting a little [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2588.5800000000004s)]
*  bit frisky and saying, hey, what's available in the market [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2592.7000000000003s)]
*  on the small side? So you're seeing an M&A action? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2594.94s)]
*  Not a ton yet. But there's definitely a growing number of [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2597.7000000000003s)]
*  startups who are realizing that what they're doing is not [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2601.3s)]
*  working. And they're not going to raise another round. And so [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2603.54s)]
*  therefore, figuring out a graceful exit, whether it's an [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2606.34s)]
*  aqua hire or some other type of landing. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2609.7400000000002s)]
*  Got it. Those are those might be the accurate walking the planks. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2612.98s)]
*  Yes, those are the walking the planks, you're gonna start seeing [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2615.9s)]
*  a lot more of that for sure. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2617.94s)]
*  Freeberg, your thoughts on the on the public markets here in [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2619.1s)]
*  relation to privates, and people walk in the plank. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2622.34s)]
*  I don't think there is a public market right now. There's no IPO [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2626.7400000000002s)]
*  window. This arm thing is, you know, pretty forced. It seems [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2629.3s)]
*  it's not like there's a ton of pent up public demand to buy [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2635.38s)]
*  these arm shares. At least that's what it seems. So you [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2638.7000000000003s)]
*  know, they're gonna go shop it, they're gonna find out what the [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2641.86s)]
*  market tells them it's worth. And, and then we'll see. Nvidia [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2643.9s)]
*  is going to help buoy it, I'm sure. There'll be an argument [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2647.7000000000003s)]
*  that, you know, all boats will rise, and arm will be a [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2650.46s)]
*  beneficiary. But I don't know if that necessarily leads into the [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2654.5s)]
*  IPO window being open again, I think we've all heard the [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2657.7400000000002s)]
*  commentary from Morgan Stanley that they don't think the windows [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2660.5s)]
*  opening until q2 q3 of next year, maybe I can't remember the [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2663.18s)]
*  exact commentary. But as we all know, a lot of LPs in venture [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2667.98s)]
*  funds and private equity funds are waiting for the IPO window [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2675.14s)]
*  to reopen before they're going to start reallocating capital [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2679.1s)]
*  back into the private venture funds. Because they need to get [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2681.74s)]
*  liquid in order to be able to recycle capital back into the [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2686.18s)]
*  next class of funds. So this glut right now, this inability [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2688.7s)]
*  to kind of get companies public is certainly weighing on folks, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2693.66s)]
*  you know, you effectively have three options when you're running [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2696.5s)]
*  a private company. You got to keep raising money, which means [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2699.98s)]
*  either raise private capital or go public. And we've talked [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2705.98s)]
*  about the challenges of late raising late stage private [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2708.54s)]
*  capital, if you've had a high private valuation in your prior [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2710.9s)]
*  round, going public is very difficult right now, because a [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2714.02s)]
*  lot of folks are still digesting and having indigestion from the [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2716.94s)]
*  last couple of years, or you got to sell the company or you got [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2720.66s)]
*  to get profitable. Now on the sell the company side, many of [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2723.02s)]
*  the acquisitions that we're seeing with a few exceptions are [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2726.02s)]
*  generally more bolt on and less like, hey, I'm going to pay some [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2728.58s)]
*  big strategic premium for some big strategic game changing [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2731.1s)]
*  company right now, because all the buyers are dealing with [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2734.34s)]
*  their own shareholder issues and their own public stock [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2737.58s)]
*  issues right now. And the you know, can you get profitable? [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2739.66s)]
*  It's really as you guys know, where a lot of folks are going, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2742.2599999999998s)]
*  which is totally restructure your ambition, restructure your [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2744.54s)]
*  plans, and build a business where customers are willing to [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2747.5s)]
*  pay you money. And where you can then take that profit and only [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2751.62s)]
*  reinvest that profit and not invest more than that profit. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2755.58s)]
*  And if you can get to that steady state, you know, you can [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2758.54s)]
*  live to see another another day, another year, another decade. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2762.06s)]
*  And those businesses, by the way, that we saw in the dot com [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2765.94s)]
*  boom and the global financial crisis that that we're able to [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2769.14s)]
*  do that during the doldrum Death Valley March that everyone's [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2771.74s)]
*  going through right now, they emerged victorious, they learned [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2775.7s)]
*  how to be frugal, they learned how to be nimble, they learned [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2778.94s)]
*  how to really focus on customer experience, because they had to [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2782.14s)]
*  increase retention, and they had to increase the prices they were [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2784.86s)]
*  charging, they learned how to be efficient with allocating [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2787.2999999999997s)]
*  resources. And so profitability became a core part of their DNA. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2789.9s)]
*  And their ability to succeed. So I think this is really a trial [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2795.1s)]
*  era. And you know, on the other side of this trial era, a number [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2800.2599999999998s)]
*  of very high quality companies will emerge. But in the interim, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2804.1s)]
*  I don't think that there's a an IPO path that a lot of folks can [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2806.7799999999997s)]
*  just check the box and say, let's go ahead and go public, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2809.58s)]
*  even if the valuation is not great. Remember, an IPO process, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2811.8199999999997s)]
*  you got to over sell your book or the bankers won't underwrite [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2814.94s)]
*  it. So if they're, you know, you can't just say, Hey, the price [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2817.5s)]
*  is now five bucks and expect anchors are there. If a company [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2820.38s)]
*  is burning money, the big concern with going public right [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2823.3s)]
*  now is that there is no pipe market, there is no ability to [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2826.26s)]
*  do secondary to do follow on offerings. So the company can't [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2829.38s)]
*  raise capital after it's public. So unless you're actually [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2832.6600000000003s)]
*  profitable, your option of going public right now really isn't [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2835.94s)]
*  there because shareholders don't want to buy shares in a company [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2839.94s)]
*  that may run out of money. Yeah. And to your point, if you take [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2842.6200000000003s)]
*  this third option, and you become really resilient, and you [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2847.38s)]
*  have profits, Jamof, that seems to me to be the setup for the [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2850.34s)]
*  next boom that we could experience in the coming years, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2854.26s)]
*  hopefully, which is, we don't have companies that are burning, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2857.2200000000003s)]
*  you know, mountains of cash, people are getting to profitable, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2860.82s)]
*  these businesses look great. And then if the big companies are [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2863.7000000000003s)]
*  now, you know, having their stock prices recover, and [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2866.58s)]
*  they've laid off 20,000 employees, and they got people [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2869.86s)]
*  returning to the office, and they're fit, and they're strong, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2872.1800000000003s)]
*  hey, that's a setup for strong companies buying strong [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2875.38s)]
*  companies or those strong companies that are private, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2877.94s)]
*  the M&A market is dead as a doornail, it's more dead than [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2880.58s)]
*  the IPO market. So two days ago, the European Commission and the [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2883.38s)]
*  CMA in the UK said that they're probing Adobe Figma, because [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2887.54s)]
*  they have some concerns that it's going to limit competition [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2891.82s)]
*  in the market. It looks like Microsoft will have to give a [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2894.82s)]
*  15 year license to video game streaming to Ubisoft in order [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2899.34s)]
*  to get the UK folks to agree to Activision to their Activision [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2903.54s)]
*  acquisition. So you're talking about the first case of $20 [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2907.18s)]
*  billion merger that may not happen. Because the CMA, they [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2910.18s)]
*  found their footing. They clearly had a win in the [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2915.06s)]
*  Microsoft Activision thing, and now they're probably going to [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2921.06s)]
*  find issue with the Adobe Figma thing. And the Europeans don't [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2924.8999999999996s)]
*  want to be left out in the action. So they're jumping in. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2928.18s)]
*  So I think the M&A market is effectively dead. What it leaves [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2930.4199999999996s)]
*  is an IPO market. But that is very tenuous, because you don't [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2934.78s)]
*  have a leading candidate that can really catalyze something. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2939.1400000000003s)]
*  And I made this prediction earlier, but I think the only [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2941.7000000000003s)]
*  company that can really catalyze things would be if people were [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2944.02s)]
*  ready to do Starlink. I mean, it's the most obvious, natural, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2946.6200000000003s)]
*  logical thing that would just get everybody excited and off [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2949.98s)]
*  the sidelines and into the arena. But that may take another [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2953.78s)]
*  year may not, but it may. In the meantime, I don't think there's [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2958.46s)]
*  any company like Instacart, I don't think people are going to [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2962.66s)]
*  be jumping off the sidelines arm, it'll be tough. Even Stripe [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2964.98s)]
*  now is like a very complicated valuation trade. And I think [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2970.02s)]
*  that that's a really technical thing to be involved in an IPO [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2973.8199999999997s)]
*  like that. A technical valuation. And so companies have [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2977.98s)]
*  no choice, except to get profitable and get to default [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2981.8599999999997s)]
*  alive to use the famous Paul Graham quote, that's the only [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2985.5s)]
*  path. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2988.74s)]
*  That's it. Yeah, I mean, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2989.58s)]
*  only path, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2990.74s)]
*  you either have to be default alive, which means profitable or [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2991.98s)]
*  default investable, which means that you're capable of producing [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2995.06s)]
*  metrics that a VC will fund. But really, that starts with 100% [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=2999.02s)]
*  year over year growth. There's a lot of companies that aren't [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3003.06s)]
*  growing very fast or growing 20 3040 5060% growth. That's not [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3005.58s)]
*  their final year or their flat even worse summer shrinking. So [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3009.8199999999997s)]
*  those cases, they got to think more like a PE model than a [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3014.54s)]
*  venture model. Yeah, and PE companies are cash flow [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3017.98s)]
*  positive. They don't burn cash. Welcome to the new world. I put [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3021.58s)]
*  out this video a few months ago, called VC or P what's the right [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3025.62s)]
*  framework for thinking about your startup. This was a [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3029.2200000000003s)]
*  craft ventures YouTube, this was a talk that I gave to our [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3032.86s)]
*  portfolio companies, we recorded it and then published it. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3036.7400000000002s)]
*  Really, it should have gotten more attention. But this was [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3039.78s)]
*  basically recommending to all those slower growing companies [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3043.26s)]
*  or portfolios stop thinking that VC funding is always going [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3046.86s)]
*  to be available and start thinking more like a PE funded [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3051.1400000000003s)]
*  private equity company, which is to say you need to cut your [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3054.46s)]
*  burn to get cash flow positive, you will then be able to control [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3057.9s)]
*  your own destiny. So yeah, this slide here, if you're not VC [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3062.3s)]
*  eligible, act realistically. So we provided some guidance on [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3064.78s)]
*  what makes a company eligible for VC funding. And you can see [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3068.82s)]
*  there's a good column, there's a great column. Good starts at 2x [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3072.58s)]
*  growth, greatest 3x gross margins, good starts at 50%, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3075.5s)]
*  great is 80%. Net dollar retention, good starts 100%, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3079.58s)]
*  great 120%. CAC payback, good is 12 to 18 months, great is six to [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3083.38s)]
*  12 months, burn multiple, good is one and a half, great is one or [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3088.54s)]
*  less. And then there's some danger zones as well. This was [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3093.42s)]
*  to provide them with some realistic guidance in terms of [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3096.5s)]
*  whether they'll be able to raise another VC round or not. And I [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3099.62s)]
*  can tell you like most startups in startup world right now are [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3102.78s)]
*  in the danger zone. It's a really tough environment. And [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3106.5400000000004s)]
*  so, you know, listen, if you're a startup with sub 1 million of [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3110.34s)]
*  ARR, and you're in the danger zone, you're probably going to [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3114.34s)]
*  pack it in or maybe you package yourself up for an aqua hire. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3116.42s)]
*  But if you're a startup that has 50 million of ARR, but you're in [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3118.82s)]
*  the danger zone, just cut your burn, you could basically make [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3124.5800000000004s)]
*  yourself cash flow positive. And you could engineer an outcome [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3127.46s)]
*  for yourself a pretty good outcome. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3131.0600000000004s)]
*  My anecdotal experience is one of our larger investments. We [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3132.46s)]
*  brought in a private equity firm where they came in. And my god, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3138.54s)]
*  it's been an incredible experience. Because the [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3142.86s)]
*  combination of how like a VC looks at a business and how a PE [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3147.06s)]
*  firm looks at a business in a moment like this is hyper [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3150.62s)]
*  additive, because it's super clarifying. It's very [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3153.7400000000002s)]
*  straightforward. And it gives a CEO an extremely clear mandate [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3156.42s)]
*  from which to operate and then they become very measurable. And [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3160.06s)]
*  I found it to be a really, really healthy thing. Now, PE [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3164.1s)]
*  guys can only get involved in companies of a certain size. So [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3168.1s)]
*  it limits [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3171.34s)]
*  50 million and above in revenue 100 million. Yeah, in our case, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3172.2599999999998s)]
*  it was a 400 million, 380 300, more than 300 million revenue. So [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3175.2999999999997s)]
*  it's a big it's a big company. But my point is just just more [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3179.7s)]
*  that we were moving along a trajectory to getting to default [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3182.86s)]
*  alive. But by adding that PE [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3186.34s)]
*  discipline to our board, boom, I think we were able to [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3189.46s)]
*  focus on it, probably a year to 18 months faster and with [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3194.34s)]
*  specific precision because they have a very different toolkit and [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3199.06s)]
*  a reaction to miss execution. And that's extremely healthy. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3202.26s)]
*  Yeah, we had this happen, you know, meeting with just from the [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3206.82s)]
*  front lines, we, we meet with we have 20,000 people apply for [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3210.1000000000004s)]
*  funding from our firm. In large part, I would say we doubled the [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3215.14s)]
*  number of applications after all in started. So shout out to my [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3218.06s)]
*  besties here, really helped our deal flow. And we find companies [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3220.74s)]
*  and we found a company that was obsessed with all in and the two [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3224.3399999999997s)]
*  founders were quants and they made this company called stone [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3227.54s)]
*  algo. We meet this company, they've got very little money. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3229.74s)]
*  It's a bootstrap company and they got to a half million [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3233.42s)]
*  dollars in revenue. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3236.3399999999997s)]
*  You know, just on sweat equity. And we find this company, it's [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3238.66s)]
*  not part of the Silicon Valley, you know, accelerator system. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3241.7s)]
*  It's basically kayak for diamonds. Shout out to the team [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3245.62s)]
*  over there. And we were able to place a nice bet on this company [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3248.1s)]
*  that was break even. And, you know, put in, you know, a couple [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3250.7s)]
*  of hundred thousand dollars to start start them down this road [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3254.4199999999996s)]

*  here. We got a lot more on the docket. I think we just maybe [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3328.78s)]
*  I'm going to jump the fence here. And we just go right to [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3333.6600000000003s)]
*  the Republican primary. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3336.7000000000003s)]
*  The funniest thing last night was that poker. We watched it. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3337.78s)]
*  You watched it during poker. Were you able to focus? [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3341.82s)]
*  You have to hear Kevin Hart react. When all these guys are [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3344.5400000000004s)]
*  doing it's one of the funniest things I've ever heard. And the [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3348.46s)]
*  worst part of the poker was [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3351.2200000000003s)]
*  the magician here we go. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3354.14s)]
*  Szechuan How can you both be playing poker here but also on [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3360.46s)]
*  the debate stage? [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3363.9s)]
*  Which I thought, which I thought was a really funny joke. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3367.98s)]
*  It was very funny. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3375.98s)]
*  Alright, listen, I know everybody's I just want to go [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3377.06s)]
*  around the horn here. Friedberg. Did you watch the debate? [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3379.3s)]
*  Who won the debate who had the largest gain? Net gain in terms [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3383.9s)]
*  of their profile in your mind after watching debate number one [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3390.2200000000003s)]
*  of the GOP David Friedberg biggest gain. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3394.34s)]
*  I watched the debate. I kind of think about these guys on three [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3397.58s)]
*  dimensions, which is the content, how dynamic they are and [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3401.26s)]
*  their personality. I think those are the three dimensions that [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3405.06s)]
*  people are going to be kind of assessing them on. I think Nikki [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3407.78s)]
*  Haley did a tremendous job gaining interest with respect to [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3411.78s)]
*  her personality and her content. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3417.1000000000004s)]
*  Bergham, Hutchinson, I don't think had a chance to move the [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3422.5400000000004s)]
*  needle on any of them. I think Vivek was by far the winner on [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3426.9s)]
*  dynamic. He had the hardest hitting biggest comeback with a [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3431.82s)]
*  very close second being Chris Christie. But I do think that [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3436.3s)]
*  Vivek got taken apart when it comes to content and I have real [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3439.7s)]
*  concerns about his personality. There's a lot of people that are [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3443.9399999999996s)]
*  just turned off by him, that he seems a little too eager that he [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3446.4199999999996s)]
*  seems a little too smart for his own good. The commentary about [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3450.06s)]
*  him being so junior and doesn't have experience, I think standing [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3455.46s)]
*  next to those guys on stage really showed to be honest, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3458.58s)]
*  Nikki Haley tearing him apart on his point of view on Russia. And [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3463.14s)]
*  we can debate the point or not. But I think she did a masterful. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3468.98s)]
*  I don't think she tore him apart. I think that biggest dunk line of [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3472.42s)]
*  the evening was when he congratulated her on her future [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3475.7000000000003s)]
*  appointments to the boards of Raytheon and Lockheed. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3479.46s)]
*  Yeah, that was brilliant. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3482.98s)]
*  I just think he's the most dynamic character. And I think [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3484.46s)]
*  people do in a democracy vote on that. They vote on how dynamic [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3486.5s)]
*  someone is. They vote on their personality and whether they can [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3489.98s)]
*  trust the person. I think Nikki Haley shines there. She seems [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3493.3s)]
*  extremely trustworthy and personable. Chris Christie came [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3496.3s)]
*  across as very personable. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3499.2200000000003s)]
*  So your big winners? [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3500.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, Mike Pence, I would say, under underwhelmed and Ron [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3502.1800000000003s)]
*  DeSantis, man, it's like he didn't show up. So I would say [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3505.78s)]
*  Haley, Chris Christie, Vivek and Kim Scott are probably like, you [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3511.34s)]
*  know, across those dimensions, like, you know, the four runners [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3516.82s)]
*  and everyone else is probably off. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3520.7000000000003s)]
*  Now let me get you mobbing and Saks, you get to comment on both [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3522.42s)]
*  of them. So I want to go to you last because you have the most [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3525.5s)]
*  passion here. Chamath, who are your big winners coming out of [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3527.78s)]
*  it? In other words, who gained the most last night? [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3532.02s)]
*  What can Brown do for you? What can Brown do for you? I think [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3534.62s)]
*  that [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3537.62s)]
*  Okay, UPS settlement, great. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3537.74s)]
*  I thought that I thought that Nikki Haley did an incredible [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3540.02s)]
*  job. And I do think that Vivek did a very good job. And I think [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3542.94s)]
*  what's interesting is that I'm fascinated to see what the [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3548.22s)]
*  Republican reaction over the next few weeks will be to Vivek. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3550.9s)]
*  And specifically, what I'm interested in seeing is, do the [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3556.3s)]
*  Trump loyalists start to where they incepted with an idea [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3560.78s)]
*  yesterday, which is that this guy can give us a lot of the [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3565.98s)]
*  talking points we want without some of the heartburn and agita [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3570.42s)]
*  that we don't want. And if he is able to thread that needle, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3575.06s)]
*  which is what I think his effective strategy has been. He [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3580.7799999999997s)]
*  could really build momentum going into the fall. So that was [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3586.38s)]
*  my that was my real takeaway is that he is refining a playbook. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3591.8599999999997s)]
*  Look, the guy is a clearly a really brilliant person. Well [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3595.7799999999997s)]
*  studied, well prepared, and dynamic. As David said, so he [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3600.3399999999997s)]
*  can, you know, clap back at people, which I think is [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3606.9s)]
*  important. But the most important thing that he's done [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3609.1s)]
*  is he has defined a very precise strategy to thread this needle [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3611.7799999999997s)]
*  of being close enough to Trump to frankly, eventually go after [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3619.38s)]
*  him. But do it in a way where he slowly building credibility [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3626.54s)]
*  among Trump loyalists. And I think if you look at where other [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3630.7s)]
*  people made huge gaps, unnecessary gaps, was they took [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3634.86s)]
*  their beliefs, and they confuse them with the strategy of [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3640.6600000000003s)]
*  winning. And that doesn't work in the Republican Party. So when [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3644.5s)]
*  the candidates were asked about Trump and the ones that drew a [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3648.58s)]
*  hard line and said that this guy's going to go to jail, what [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3650.82s)]
*  happened? They got booed. And it just ended their ability to be [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3653.02s)]
*  credible for what they said afterwards. I'm not saying that [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3658.1400000000003s)]
*  that's right or wrong. It's just an observation. So I think the [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3661.42s)]
*  fact is doing the smartest job of understanding the rules on [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3664.38s)]
*  the field. And he's in the arena to win. Okay, so that gives him [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3667.3s)]
*  a lot. That gives him a lot of change. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3672.58s)]
*  Now we go to SACS. SACS, you heard Nikki Vivek, Kristi from [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3673.78s)]
*  Freeberg. Nikki and Tim Scott. So Vivek, clearly, the buzz and [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3677.34s)]
*  the search terms and everything seems to be favoring Vivek as [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3683.98s)]
*  the big lift here. Do you think Vivek is the Trump change agent [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3686.9s)]
*  without the indictments without the baggage without the Trump [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3691.82s)]
*  derangement syndrome insanity? Is Chamath correct here that [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3696.46s)]
*  he's a more palatable version of the change agent that is Trump? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3700.1800000000003s)]
*  I think he's positioning himself as the backup plan to Trump. So [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3703.6200000000003s)]
*  he's not criticizing Trump. He is cultivating support within [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3707.7400000000002s)]
*  Trump's base. Again, not to supersede him, but I think to [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3711.6600000000003s)]
*  perhaps be a backup plan. I think it is a smart strategy. But [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3715.46s)]
*  let me back up a little bit here. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3718.46s)]
*  Who won for you? Well, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3720.58s)]
*  before you make your points, everybody else played the game. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3724.1s)]
*  Biggest game. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3727.3799999999997s)]
*  Clearly, the biggest game was Vivek that's reflected in the [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3727.9399999999996s)]
*  polling. There's a poll on Drudge Report in which 33%, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3731.62s)]
*  which was the highest number said that he won the debate. 22% [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3735.4199999999996s)]
*  for Haley, 18% for DeSantis. Kristi got 16%. The rest were just [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3738.8199999999997s)]
*  non-factors. So not scientific, but pretty scientific. But this [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3742.74s)]
*  is corroborated by Nate Silver had a sub stack this morning, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3747.18s)]
*  basically saying that based on the buzz on social media and the [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3750.4199999999996s)]
*  sentiment, and Google Trends, Google Trends, he predicted that [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3754.14s)]
*  Vivek would, we keep saying Vivek, Vivek, it's it is, it's [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3759.8199999999997s)]
*  Vivek. He's gonna have the biggest bounce out of the [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3764.46s)]
*  debate. Partly, that's a function of the fact that he [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3768.2999999999997s)]
*  was the least well known candidate. Okay, so this gave [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3771.58s)]
*  him a lot of exposure. And he is a good orator. I mean, just [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3774.54s)]
*  the way he talks, the energy, the timber of his voice, he [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3777.9s)]
*  projects well. And he had a clear point of view in this [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3781.98s)]
*  debate. You may not agree with everything he said, but he had [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3785.38s)]
*  a very clear point of view. And I expect that both the number of [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3788.22s)]
*  people who like him and the number of people who dislike him [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3791.42s)]
*  will go up as a result of this. But I think the net effect of [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3794.3s)]
*  that will be positive. Now, let me back up, just give you a [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3797.02s)]
*  couple more thoughts on the debate. First of all, in terms [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3800.02s)]
*  of winners, I think the Republican Party in a way [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3802.18s)]
*  demonstrated that it is the party of ideas where there [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3805.7s)]
*  actually are debates happening. Because you saw here, I think, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3809.4199999999996s)]
*  real differences between the candidates, and I could break [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3813.1s)]
*  them up into really three categories, if you like, there's [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3816.62s)]
*  this neocon wing of sort of hardline foreign policy hawks. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3819.22s)]
*  And you saw Nikki Haley's part of that and Chris Christie and [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3825.18s)]
*  Pence, and Tim Scott, then you had this religious right [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3827.62s)]
*  faction where you've got Pence and Scott. And then you've kind [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3832.06s)]
*  of got the MAGA wing, which Vivek really took up the mantle [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3835.58s)]
*  of opposing Ukraine and defending Trump. So you have [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3839.02s)]
*  three very different groups within the party who are [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3843.02s)]
*  battling, I think, for mindshare within the party and to be the [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3845.5s)]
*  future of the party. So it's not just about candidates and [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3849.2599999999998s)]
*  personal style, but it really is about ideas. You compare that to [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3852.7s)]
*  the Democratic Party, they're not even having a debate, they're [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3855.9s)]
*  protecting Biden from a debate. There could be a real debate [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3858.1800000000003s)]
*  because R.F.K. Jr. has really different ideas. And he would [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3861.42s)]
*  like to take the party in a very different direction, the [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3865.82s)]
*  direction of his father and uncle, Bobby Kennedy and John F. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3868.2200000000003s)]
*  Kennedy, he's saying that we have moved away from where we [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3873.26s)]
*  should be as a party. But the people who control the Democratic [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3876.5s)]
*  Party do not want to have that debate, they have shut it down [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3880.02s)]
*  completely. There is no debate, they're just protecting Biden. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3882.62s)]
*  So that's number one is I think we should give the Republican [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3885.54s)]
*  Party some credit for being willing to discuss and debate [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3889.1s)]
*  ideas. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3892.02s)]
*  I agree with you on that. I love the fact that you had a [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3892.42s)]
*  vibrant debate, you had differences of opinions. Now it [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3895.46s)]
*  was a little like a UFC fight and you know, zingers and back [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3897.9s)]
*  and forth. But I did like the fact that you had people who in [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3901.9s)]
*  moderation was actually surprisingly good when they [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3907.2599999999998s)]
*  forced them to say like, would you give Trump a pardon? Or, you [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3909.58s)]
*  know, what would you do in terms of support for Ukraine? This was [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3913.18s)]
*  like really well done. And they had that 30 second thing where [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3916.42s)]
*  they stopped people, they say, hey, this is a 30 second one. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3918.98s)]
*  And they had to rein in Pence because he kept, you know, [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3921.06s)]
*  interrupting and they were kind of respectful. So I just want to [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3924.54s)]
*  shout out to Fox for good moderation. There were some [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3927.54s)]
*  crazy zingers in there as well. And it seems like we live in [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3930.8599999999997s)]
*  zinger culture. I think the the best zinger goes to the [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3934.2599999999998s)]
*  moderator who said, let's talk about the elephant that's not in [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3937.62s)]
*  the room. And then they brought up Trump. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3940.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, frankly, that's that one. But that was pretty hardcore. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3942.54s)]
*  Well, so let's talk about winner number two, which was Trump [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3945.9s)]
*  because Trump did not participate and he didn't pay [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3948.82s)]
*  any price whatsoever for that. He barely got mentioned or [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3951.06s)]
*  attacked on that stage. And then he did this interview with [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3954.54s)]
*  Tucker, which started five minutes before the debate, which [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3957.74s)]
*  was kind of brilliant because once again, Trump was able to [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3960.94s)]
*  suck up a lot of the oxygen, maybe not all of it, but a lot [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3963.46s)]
*  of oxygen without even participating in the debate. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3966.2599999999998s)]
*  It was a perfect bookend. I watched both. It was a perfect [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3968.34s)]
*  bookend. You got Trump over here saying, Chamath, I'm [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3971.26s)]
*  interested in your position. But he said, Listen, I don't need to [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3974.0200000000004s)]
*  be in there with these guys mudslinging and they have zero [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3976.1000000000004s)]
*  or 1%. And I think he got the sense that he's excited to [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3977.98s)]
*  debate them when there's two people left or something like [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3981.46s)]
*  that. What did you think of? Did you watch Trump's thing? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3984.1400000000003s)]
*  Freeburg or Chamath? [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3986.26s)]
*  No, I watched it. I watched the debate. I watched both the [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3988.2200000000003s)]
*  debate. And then I watched I do think Trump effectively won the [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3992.1400000000003s)]
*  debate night. Because you had all these guys going at each [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3995.86s)]
*  other. And then you had Trump playing the Trump card. I'm not [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=3999.18s)]
*  even going to show up. Because I don't have to. He literally made [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4004.14s)]
*  himself better than everyone else in the room. By saying I'm [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4007.46s)]
*  not even it's not even worth my time to show up to talk to you [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4010.58s)]
*  guys go ahead and fight with each other. I'll also just [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4013.7799999999997s)]
*  restate this this point about Vivek. I think it became [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4016.06s)]
*  abundantly clear that his strategy is his strategy is to [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4019.46s)]
*  pander to the Trump audience. That his commentary about you [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4023.8999999999996s)]
*  know, God is real. Climate change is a hoax. There's two [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4027.98s)]
*  genders. He knows through polling, through his [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4032.26s)]
*  understanding, and his intelligence, that this is what [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4035.9s)]
*  this audience that is the bulk of the voting members of the [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4039.78s)]
*  Republican Party want to hear. And he is telling them what they [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4043.82s)]
*  want to hear. And then is that a politician? Yeah, I mean, isn't [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4047.54s)]
*  that better than pandering to the military industrial complex [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4052.14s)]
*  like Nikki Haley did? There was a comment last night that I [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4054.7s)]
*  thought was really important, which is that leadership is not [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4056.86s)]
*  about consensus. And what he is doing is he is reflecting back [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4060.02s)]
*  the consensus view of the majority of people in that party [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4063.5s)]
*  in order to get himself elected, rather than leading with a [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4065.86s)]
*  different message that casts a different opportunity, the [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4068.46s)]
*  different light on the opportunity for this nation. And [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4070.86s)]
*  I think that's really where he and others on that stage, or he [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4073.82s)]
*  particularly falls short, is that he speaks too much to what [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4076.7400000000002s)]
*  people already believe and say, because he knows that that's [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4080.26s)]
*  what they're voting for Trump about. And then the bet is that [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4083.38s)]
*  there's some chance, not 100%, but some chance that Trump [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4086.46s)]
*  doesn't make it all the way guns up in jail, or people start to [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4090.18s)]
*  turn on him. And then he's the front runner. Because he's [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4093.2200000000003s)]
*  basically captivated that audience. Hold on, but free [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4096.34s)]
*  Berg, and I will let you address it here. Chamath just said, the [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4099.66s)]
*  brilliance of the vague in his positioning here is that he [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4102.78s)]
*  understands how to win. And he is playing this game. And you [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4106.06s)]
*  call it pandering. Sax is I think saying it's understanding [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4110.46s)]
*  the needs of that audience. The job of a politician, Sax is to [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4113.74s)]
*  win and to stay in office. So I don't believe the vakes [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4117.42s)]
*  positions on a lot of the stuff. I think he is pandering. I [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4120.9s)]
*  think he wouldn't do what Trump did. I think, you know, he's [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4123.94s)]
*  doing the pardon promise because he knows he gets some votes. So [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4127.46s)]
*  how do you reconcile this? Your job is to win, right? And you [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4130.7s)]
*  would rather see DeSantis maybe pick up on some of this action? [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4134.26s)]
*  No? As your preferred candidate? [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4137.34s)]
*  That's a good question. Free Berg, do you think that a [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4141.26s)]
*  politician's job, when you're running for President of the [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4144.58s)]
*  United States, is it to understand the conditions on the [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4147.9800000000005s)]
*  field and win or not? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4150.900000000001s)]
*  I think the politicians job or I don't want to say the job. I [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4153.780000000001s)]
*  think the opportunity to get elected in a democracy is to [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4157.820000000001s)]
*  provide leadership to cast a light on where you think the [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4161.34s)]
*  country or whatever constituency you're supposed to lead can go [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4165.14s)]
*  to provide a sense of opportunity to provide a sense [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4169.7s)]
*  of optimism, to provide a sense of what's not happening today [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4172.82s)]
*  that should be different, rather than reflecting back to those [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4176.22s)]
*  people exactly what they want. Now, the flip side of that is [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4179.62s)]
*  exactly what you're saying, Chamath, which is that I think [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4181.94s)]
*  what happens in a democracy is that people elect people that [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4184.02s)]
*  represent what they believe. And I think that's what's going to [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4186.3s)]
*  happen. And he's raising his hand and he's saying I believe [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4188.58s)]
*  these things, and he's going to get elected or he's going to put [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4192.06s)]
*  himself in a position to get elected if Trump drops out. I [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4194.58s)]
*  just think there's a lot of people who are very smart, who [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4197.9s)]
*  if they are too idealistic will achieve nothing in their lives. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4201.78s)]
*  And I don't think Vivek is one of those people. Idealism has a [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4204.78s)]
*  place in the world. It's not on the debate stage when you're [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4207.74s)]
*  running for president of the United States. Okay, Sax, you [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4210.099999999999s)]
*  wanted to get in here, go. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4211.78s)]
*  Okay, let's take the issue of Ukraine, because that was one of [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4212.62s)]
*  the main issues that Vivek differed from the rest of the [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4215.54s)]
*  people on that stage. There is polling by CNN that a majority [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4219.46s)]
*  of Americans have now turned against the idea of giving more [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4223.42s)]
*  aid to Ukraine. I'm sure that number is much higher in the [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4226.38s)]
*  Republican Party. If you remember, there was an event, [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4229.1s)]
*  Charlie Kirk, who is a conservative influencer, has an [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4233.26s)]
*  event called Turning Point USA. And they did polling of their [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4237.26s)]
*  conference attendees. The number one issue that everyone agreed on [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4240.58s)]
*  was Ukraine. 95% of the attendees opposed giving more aid [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4244.58s)]
*  to Ukraine. Donald Trump only got 85% popularity. So the base [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4249.86s)]
*  of the party is even more united against Joe Biden's policy in [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4254.9s)]
*  Ukraine than they are on loving Trump. Okay, that tells you [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4259.5s)]
*  something. And yet, Vivek is the only candidate on that stage that [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4262.46s)]
*  was willing to raise his hand, like aggressively, like [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4266.46s)]
*  full throatedly, not kind of a half hearted, to saying that he [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4269.7s)]
*  did not agree with Biden's policy on Ukraine. What is wrong [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4272.9s)]
*  with all these other people on the stage that they cannot [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4276.099999999999s)]
*  understand what is wrong with Biden's Ukraine policy, which, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4278.299999999999s)]
*  by the way, is the signature policy of his presidency? What [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4282.46s)]
*  is the point of Republicans nominating a candidate who's [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4287.18s)]
*  just going to agree with Joe Biden on providing aid to [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4290.18s)]
*  Ukraine as much as it takes for as long as it takes? [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4294.1s)]
*  Is this your position here at Freeberg? Is that, you know, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4296.58s)]
*  win at all costs, let's call it the Vivek, win at all costs, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4299.62s)]
*  play the game on the field, as Shematha is saying, and just win [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4302.62s)]
*  the game versus being principled? Because you did have [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4304.94s)]
*  a group of- [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4309.5s)]
*  No, I think that that framing is such a setup. Can I just say [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4309.9s)]
*  something? [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4312.74s)]
*  Okay, frame it how you want. You said playing the game on the [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4312.9s)]
*  field, and Freeberg said having a principle here and having like [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4314.86s)]
*  an actual vision for the country. So I'm taking both of [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4319.379999999999s)]
*  yours. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4321.74s)]
*  Look, I think the framing is not what is wrong with Vivek, but [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4322.379999999999s)]
*  what is wrong with candidates like Christie and Pence and [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4325.54s)]
*  Haley and Scott, where even though 95% of their party is [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4330.54s)]
*  opposed to Ukraine, they are adopting Joe Biden's policy. And [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4335.54s)]
*  their only criticism of Joe Biden is that he's not doing [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4339.74s)]
*  enough fast enough for that. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4342.58s)]
*  Okay, let's let Freeberg get in here. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4343.78s)]
*  They're completely out of step. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4345.219999999999s)]
*  We've got your point. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4346.099999999999s)]
*  With the Republican Party as it stands today. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4346.74s)]
*  We got your point. But is it not Freeberg, what you're saying is [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4348.62s)]
*  that there is this profile and courage to invoke that book, [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4351.26s)]
*  where you there's something that's unpopular that you have [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4354.9s)]
*  to do. And I think Nikki Haley, Pence, Christie, and the other [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4358.26s)]
*  ones who are pro defending Ukraine from Russia, their [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4361.74s)]
*  profile encourage Freeberg is that they will go against that [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4366.42s)]
*  95% polling and say it's the right thing to do. We should [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4369.78s)]
*  defend Taiwan, we should defend Israel, we should defend Ukraine [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4373.18s)]
*  against those are three different issues. I know it's [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4376.86s)]
*  three different issues, but they were all evoked by Vivek [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4378.9800000000005s)]
*  Vivek himself. So Freeberg, your chance. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4381.54s)]
*  I think the West Wing does a great job of exploring both sides [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4383.46s)]
*  of this, which is, when do you have to break the mold and break [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4387.5s)]
*  the expectation of the people to do the right principle thing? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4391.14s)]
*  And when do you have to do the thing that you don't think is [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4394.9400000000005s)]
*  right, but it's what the people want to have happen? And I think [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4397.42s)]
*  that that's a obviously a balance that needs to be struck [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4401.9400000000005s)]
*  when you're in this position of being an elected leader in a [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4405.14s)]
*  democracy. And so there's no there's no real answer. I wish [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4407.58s)]
*  that there was, like, I wish Mr. Beast had like a presidential [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4410.66s)]
*  process, like he saw his Olympics video that he did last [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4416.22s)]
*  week, where he brought people and he created this like, he's [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4419.18s)]
*  like five things. I wish that we had something like that to elect [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4422.1s)]
*  president, that it was more than just oration, because we elect [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4425.38s)]
*  the president today, based on their oratory skills, they go on [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4429.38s)]
*  stage and who has the best quickie comment, the person who [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4432.740000000001s)]
*  would be the most decisive under pressure doesn't necessarily [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4435.34s)]
*  win. The person who can inspire and attract and retain the best [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4438.5s)]
*  leadership, the person who can have the best foreign policy [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4442.54s)]
*  interactions with other leaders doesn't necessarily win. Those [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4444.9400000000005s)]
*  are skills that show up in other contexts. And when we put [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4448.3s)]
*  people on a stage, and we say, Okay, speak to the audience, the [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4452.74s)]
*  guy who speaks the best looks the best. It's not necessarily [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4456.54s)]
*  the guy who is best equipped to handle the challenge of the Bay [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4460.14s)]
*  of Pigs, or, you know, the decision on whether or not I [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4463.42s)]
*  think you're being very dismissive. I think you're [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4467.14s)]
*  being very distressed. You have the floor. Go, go. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4469.34s)]
*  Like, that's kind of like saying, why isn't it that it's [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4472.58s)]
*  the quarterback with the strongest arm that isn't the most [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4475.58s)]
*  successful? Why? Because that person is a fucking loser. And [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4478.82s)]
*  the person that's the winner is the one that can thread together [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4482.74s)]
*  a multifaceted set of skills to win the game. Tom Brady was [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4485.66s)]
*  drafted in the seventh round, not the first round. He wins the [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4489.94s)]
*  game, because he has the requisite skills, which is a [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4493.9s)]
*  basket of things, and a nuance of skills in different moments at [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4496.82s)]
*  different times. And so I think that you're being a little glib [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4500.62s)]
*  by saying the person isn't cool under pressure or this or that. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4503.94s)]
*  It's not true. The people that win these races have a preter [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4507.86s)]
*  natural ability to be a complete egoist, but not a narcissist. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4513.58s)]
*  That is an incredibly deft set of skills that a fair rare people [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4518.98s)]
*  have. It gives them this energy to be out there talking to [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4523.099999999999s)]
*  1000s and 1000s and 1000s and 1000s of people may be saying [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4527.58s)]
*  the same thing 1000s of times. But being able to stay focused, [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4531.42s)]
*  being able to be on point, having a sense of what they need [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4535.46s)]
*  to believe, know the details in a certain part, know the high [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4538.06s)]
*  level in another part, stay punchy, but stay affable, stay [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4540.9400000000005s)]
*  up. That's the game. There are a set of skills that it takes to [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4543.74s)]
*  become president. You test the oration skills of a person when [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4546.9s)]
*  you put them on a debate stage, you don't test the other complex [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4550.54s)]
*  skills that it takes to be president. And getting people to [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4553.78s)]
*  understand the complexity of the role and all the other aspects [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4556.92s)]
*  of someone's personality are lacking in these fucking debates. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4560.54s)]
*  But there are other these other skills are in play in many [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4563.82s)]
*  things other than just the debate. Like the campaign is a [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4566.46s)]
*  highly sophisticated orchestration of running a small [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4569.22s)]
*  little government. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4573.26s)]
*  Mario Cuomo famously said that you campaign in poetry and and [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4573.9s)]
*  govern in prose. And there is a difference between campaigning [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4579.0199999999995s)]
*  skills and governing skills. There is a gap there. I would [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4581.94s)]
*  update it to say that you govern in prose and campaign and [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4585.46s)]
*  tweets, you know, so the campaign definitely puts a huge [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4589.34s)]
*  emphasis on a candidate's communication skills. But that [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4592.9800000000005s)]
*  is not all just gloss or style. It also has to do with their [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4596.34s)]
*  policies and the nuances of their policies, and how they [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4603.08s)]
*  handle pressure, how good they are under pressure and how good [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4606.66s)]
*  they are when they're attacked. So you know, we put these [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4610.38s)]
*  candidates are pressure cooker and kind of learn who they [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4613.5s)]
*  really are. I'm not sure it's a horrible process. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4615.42s)]
*  So sex, let me ask you a question. Yeah, Pence has been [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4617.5s)]
*  in the situation room dealing with a foreign adversary. Vivek [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4620.34s)]
*  has no military or defense experience. He has no foreign [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4624.86s)]
*  state experience. How do you assess Vivek in his ability to [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4627.22s)]
*  address those critical issues that he's going to have to lead [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4631.54s)]
*  us through versus someone who's been there and done that? And [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4634.0s)]
*  how do you know, give a great question. Great question. Okay, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4637.1s)]
*  trust them. You trust the listen, Pence made that argument [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4639.46s)]
*  against a vague, apparently not realizing that the guy he was [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4642.5s)]
*  vice president for was in that exact same position in 2016. No [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4646.06s)]
*  previous political experience, right? No experience being in [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4649.700000000001s)]
*  the situation room. The only reason why Pence got to warm his [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4652.76s)]
*  ass on a chair in the situation room is because Donald Trump [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4656.700000000001s)]
*  picked him to be his VP. Oh, but he wasn't responsible for [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4659.860000000001s)]
*  making any important decisions. He was basically clocking time [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4662.660000000001s)]
*  as vice president, give me a break. And that's why he's at [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4666.34s)]
*  what is it one or 1%? No one gives a shit about Pence. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4669.38s)]
*  That's what they said about Obama as well. Obama had zero [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4672.820000000001s)]
*  experience. Obama barely could get elected before he became [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4675.9s)]
*  Senator and then president in a matter of four years. And for [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4679.0599999999995s)]
*  Bush, what happened to Bush? They said that exact argument as [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4682.139999999999s)]
*  well. And what do they do? They packed them with Rumsfeld and [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4684.98s)]
*  Cheney. How did that end? [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4687.12s)]
*  Yeah, I just want to also point out here, sometimes things get a [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4689.42s)]
*  little bit heated. And when we get heated, it's typically [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4692.179999999999s)]
*  because we're we're triangulating around something [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4694.299999999999s)]
*  very important. I think what we're trying triangulating [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4696.42s)]
*  around here is that we are moving from an era of incumbents, [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4698.54s)]
*  and insiders to an era of outsiders. If you to your point, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4703.7s)]
*  sacks, post Trump, we now have the two or three most [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4707.26s)]
*  fascinating candidates are people who do social media who [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4713.3s)]
*  do podcasts who do earned media, like we talked about, I think [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4717.9400000000005s)]
*  two or three weeks ago is really good insight. And the vague is [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4720.54s)]
*  has mastered it. And he is exactly like Trump. And he's [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4723.42s)]
*  exactly like Obama, to a certain extent, in that those people were [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4726.3s)]
*  incredibly personable. They knew how to talk on podcasts, they [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4728.820000000001s)]
*  knew how to engage people. And I think that, you know, this [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4731.38s)]
*  spiciness that we're having here on the pod and the spiciness that [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4735.7s)]
*  you're seeing with some of those candidates, is that we're moving [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4738.22s)]
*  from traditional media defining these candidates to direct to [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4741.9400000000005s)]
*  consumer direct through Twitter slash x direct through podcasts, [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4747.54s)]
*  this podcast included, making people like RFK and Vivek, you [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4751.74s)]
*  know, very palatable people and Ross Perot, I know, I'm gonna get [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4755.54s)]
*  laughed up for bringing this up, who got 19% of the vote, which [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4758.86s)]
*  is a serious number. He went direct as well. At that time, [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4762.94s)]
*  happening. No, he got 19% per Oh, because he actually went as an [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4767.86s)]
*  independent all the way. And what Ross Perot did was the [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4773.38s)]
*  equivalent of what Vivek and RFK are doing on pockets, he bought [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4776.219999999999s)]
*  television time, you don't know that or some people who want to [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4779.7s)]
*  spend out understand who Ross Perot even is, but look it up. He [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4782.299999999999s)]
*  bought television time, and he went direct to the country with [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4785.78s)]
*  our budget. I thought this is going to be the future of [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4789.219999999999s)]
*  politics. What we're witnessing right now is the transition from [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4793.3s)]
*  traditional media and the establishment, defining who the [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4796.38s)]
*  great candidates are to the public. And the people on [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4800.179999999999s)]
*  podcasts and social media who are the tip of the spear on the [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4803.58s)]
*  vanguard, they're going to pick the winners. And I think this [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4806.099999999999s)]
*  could be the tipping point election Trump was the first [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4809.179999999999s)]
*  Obama then Trump and now the vague and RFK. So I just like [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4812.1s)]
*  you all to maybe respond to that, especially you, sex and [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4816.54s)]
*  she brought this media issue up two weeks ago. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4818.900000000001s)]
*  Let me partially agree with Freeberg. In this sense, look, [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4821.22s)]
*  obviously track record is important. Obviously, the [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4824.620000000001s)]
*  ability to be an executive executive functioning is [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4827.740000000001s)]
*  important for the chief executive of our country. So [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4831.660000000001s)]
*  I'm not saying that we shouldn't look at that kind of record. And [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4834.740000000001s)]
*  this is why was one of the reasons why I support DeSantis. I [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4840.02s)]
*  think he's been a brilliant governor. He's done a superb [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4842.46s)]
*  job in the state of Florida. He did the best job of all the [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4844.580000000001s)]
*  governors during COVID. I think he did a better job than Trump [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4848.1s)]
*  did during COVID. So listen, I think those things are important [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4851.1s)]
*  where I disagree is just because Mike Pence has again warmed a [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4853.620000000001s)]
*  chair in the situation room. As Vice President, to me, that's [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4857.26s)]
*  not that relevant experience. I mean, the VP is kind of a [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4861.660000000001s)]
*  nothing job unless something terrible happens to the [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4866.18s)]
*  president and they get tapped on the shoulder. So I just [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4869.34s)]
*  disagree with what is relevant experience. Second, I think it's [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4872.38s)]
*  important to recognize that the reason why the vague has Elaine [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4876.900000000001s)]
*  here, and the reason why Trump had Elaine in 2016, is that the [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4880.860000000001s)]
*  establishment wing of the party is so completely out of touch [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4885.74s)]
*  with what the base wants. Look, the reason why Trump came out of [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4889.54s)]
*  nowhere in 2016 is he basically turned everything on its head. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4893.26s)]
*  He said, no more bushes, no more of these stupid forever wars in [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4896.74s)]
*  the Middle East. We need to build a wall, no more of this [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4899.62s)]
*  open border policy. And we need to reset our population with [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4902.62s)]
*  China. Those were three mega issues that no one else in the [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4906.54s)]
*  party was talking about. And the mega issue today is Ukraine, 95% [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4909.94s)]
*  of the base is against it. And they have left the vague this [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4915.74s)]
*  gigantic lane to exploit. Why? I don't know. I mean, they're [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4918.58s)]
*  trapped in legacy neocon thinking that the US is being [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4922.9s)]
*  sacked. Are he kept saying that? I think that was a great moment. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4927.0599999999995s)]
*  It's a combination of being trapped in legacy thinking where [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4931.74s)]
*  we have to be the policeman of the world, combined with all the [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4934.9s)]
*  big donors in the party, okay, many of whom are wrapped up with [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4937.3s)]
*  the military industrial complex want to contribute to that. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4939.78s)]
*  Can you just say it again? What you feel like I'm not hearing? [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4942.26s)]
*  No, I think that being president requires being better more than [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4945.82s)]
*  just an orator. And I think that the debates allow the best or [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4949.0599999999995s)]
*  rater to show off their skills and capabilities on the debate [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4952.58s)]
*  stage. I was saying I wish that there were other events, I would [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4955.22s)]
*  love to see some set of systems to expose the candidate success [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4958.900000000001s)]
*  or failings and how well equipped they are, rather than [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4964.34s)]
*  the person who can just give the best interview. We all know [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4967.62s)]
*  this when you interview a candidate, an engineer, the [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4970.14s)]
*  engineer that gives the best interview is not necessarily [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4973.18s)]
*  going to become the best engineer, you can look at their [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4975.42s)]
*  code to see if they're a great, great engineer, you can talk to [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4977.860000000001s)]
*  people that report it to them to see if they're a great manager, [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4981.18s)]
*  you can learn more about their success and skills through more [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4983.86s)]
*  than just their oration on the stage. And yes, there's data and [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4987.26s)]
*  fact that we can pull from these people. I was just speculating [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4989.78s)]
*  in kind of a pseudo silly way about the concept of can we do [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4993.46s)]
*  more than just put people on a debate? [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4997.58s)]
*  How do you hire a CEO for your companies? [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=4999.0599999999995s)]
*  So the board? Well, yeah, what I'll tell you we don't do is we [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5001.78s)]
*  don't have the employees elect the CEO through a vote by having [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5005.66s)]
*  that CEO go in front of you. I'm the best guy for the job. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5008.54s)]
*  I hear you, but you're part of it. But you do reference calls, [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5011.94s)]
*  right? We we talked about their strategy. And you know, through [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5016.0599999999995s)]
*  the interview through the reference calls, through looking [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5020.139999999999s)]
*  at the performance of other businesses they've built and run [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5022.66s)]
*  and, you know, that can have a fulsome understanding of his [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5025.0599999999995s)]
*  candidacy and his ability to be president. My point is, I think [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5029.54s)]
*  that there are certain things like with Trump, that had not [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5032.46s)]
*  been tested or tried that are going to come up in this role [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5035.179999999999s)]
*  that they'd never done before in the past. And I'm not saying [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5037.98s)]
*  look, by the way, I'm certainly not a big, you know, political [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5041.26s)]
*  career guys, you guys know, I think, you know, I hate that [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5044.06s)]
*  people build a career out of politics. I think it's the most [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5047.1s)]
*  inane, ridiculous thing. And if we could go back and rewrite the [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5049.3s)]
*  Constitution, that's probably the first thing I put in there. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5052.1s)]
*  The thing with this line of thinking, and maybe this is where [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5054.42s)]
*  I reacted, so I apologize if I personalized it, is that it [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5057.66s)]
*  creates the risk of exactly what you just said in this, what you [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5060.62s)]
*  just said right now, which is this blob class of people that [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5065.26s)]
*  use those arguments as the reason why change can't happen. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5069.98s)]
*  Yeah, why it must disagree with that. I don't disagree with that. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5073.58s)]
*  I think that is the huge red flag about this line of [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5076.7s)]
*  argumentation around why out of the box candidates can't be [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5079.339999999999s)]
*  evaluated by reasonably smart people of which there are 300 [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5083.339999999999s)]
*  million of us in America that have the ability to see it. And [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5087.86s)]
*  so I actually don't think it's as hard of a job as we make it [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5091.0199999999995s)]
*  out to be and that when you get 180 190 million different [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5094.86s)]
*  people voting, I do think you actually get a pretty good [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5099.34s)]
*  wisdom of the crowds and take away Trump's UI for a second. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5102.38s)]
*  What Sachs just said is so profound because like what Trump [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5108.9800000000005s)]
*  nailed was three ginormous lanes that turned out now we can all [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5111.78s)]
*  agree with. None of us wanted these wars. Everybody basically [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5116.22s)]
*  believes that the border needed to be closed. And everybody [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5120.14s)]
*  believes that China has taken advantage in a way that is [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5124.18s)]
*  really hollowed out the middle class in America. Those were [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5128.14s)]
*  three totems that nobody would have touched. And if we had [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5131.26s)]
*  allowed this whole thing of like, oh, Trump doesn't have [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5135.1s)]
*  this Trump doesn't have that he just gives cute nicknames to [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5137.900000000001s)]
*  his average series, we would have missed that he actually had [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5140.38s)]
*  enough executive function to nail the three biggest themes of [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5144.1s)]
*  our current lifetime. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5148.02s)]
*  Okay, I think that's fair. I guess my commentary can just be [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5150.22s)]
*  reduced down to the debate stage and saying who won and who should [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5152.9400000000005s)]
*  be is different than who should be president. Okay, necessarily. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5156.34s)]
*  I got it looking at the broader context. Good job. Good job. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5159.06s)]
*  But the presidential candidacy is much more than just as the [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5163.06s)]
*  base. Okay, yes. There's a lot of other things going on. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5166.78s)]
*  If we're judging people just based on how well they talk and [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5170.02s)]
*  how quick on their feet they are. Chris Christie is a great [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5173.02s)]
*  talker. He's a media trained talker. But guess what he got [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5175.46s)]
*  booed. That was the debate. The dole point of the debate for me [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5179.14s)]
*  was that he I thought took a kind of like a low key racist [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5183.3s)]
*  jab at Vivek when he was like, read it. He referred to person [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5188.02s)]
*  Yeah, the last person in one of these debates who stood in the [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5191.62s)]
*  middle of the stage and said, what's a skinny guy with an [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5193.9400000000005s)]
*  odd last name? doing up here was Barack Obama. I'm afraid we're [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5196.22s)]
*  dealing with the same type of amateur standing on the stage [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5199.74s)]
*  tonight. You felt was a little [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5202.58s)]
*  No, not that was when he called Vivek like chat GPT essentially [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5203.74s)]
*  saying already have a guy who sounds like chat GPT standing [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5207.46s)]
*  here's like this Indian tech worker and I thought, hey, man, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5210.06s)]
*  that's what you read into it. That's interesting. I thought he [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5212.94s)]
*  was just saying he sounded as a South Asian tech worker that [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5215.0199999999995s)]
*  sure that it's what I read. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5218.139999999999s)]
*  I read that he was that he was very like, robotic and formulaic [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5220.259999999999s)]
*  or something. But what did you how did you read it as a as the [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5225.98s)]
*  palace white guy on the panel, [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5229.099999999999s)]
*  there was something almost personal about the way that both [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5230.339999999999s)]
*  Christie and Pence seemed to react to a vague it was almost [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5233.7s)]
*  like, who are you you young whippersnapper to be on the [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5236.78s)]
*  stage with me, especially Pence, I've been the vice president, [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5239.94s)]
*  who are you, you know, [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5243.66s)]
*  and all this was dismissive. Here's what his quotes were [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5245.339999999999s)]
*  dismissive. And I think there was a resentment that even [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5247.54s)]
*  before this debate, the vague was rising in the polls and [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5250.139999999999s)]
*  those guys were going nowhere. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5253.179999999999s)]
*  Let me explain it to you. And again, it's not just oratorical [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5254.78s)]
*  skill. It's the substance. Yes, of the issues, and where he's [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5257.58s)]
*  willing to go that these other candidates are not here are the [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5261.46s)]
*  quotes to respond to let me explain it to you. Vivek. I'll [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5264.379999999999s)]
*  go slower this time. Now is not the time for on the job training. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5268.1s)]
*  And we don't need to bring in a rookie all this dismissive stuff [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5271.820000000001s)]
*  from Pence to the vague got some applause because you know, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5275.42s)]
*  conflict conflict and confrontation gets applause by [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5278.860000000001s)]
*  these lunatics in the audience. And like it was like a [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5281.3s)]
*  well, you also get an allocation of seats for your own team. So [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5284.26s)]
*  yes, it was the only reason why Pence was VP is because a rookie [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5287.34s)]
*  got elected president. Yeah, that's a very good. It's a good [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5292.620000000001s)]
*  insight. Yeah, that was very weird. I thought the thing that [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5294.740000000001s)]
*  was very interesting was not to make it all about Trump, but he [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5297.58s)]
*  was the quote unquote elephant that was not in the room was the [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5300.0199999999995s)]
*  undying support for Pence, you had everybody say Pence did the [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5304.18s)]
*  right thing on January six, what was your takeaway from that [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5308.22s)]
*  sacks because there was some there was a mix of booze and [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5311.28s)]
*  cheers for Christie when he kind of said like, we need somebody [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5315.18s)]
*  who doesn't behave this way. It's unbecoming of the [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5318.14s)]
*  presidency referring to Trump. So what was your take on is the [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5320.38s)]
*  Republican Party in this audience trying to move past [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5324.42s)]
*  Trump given all these indictments, I'm going to leave [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5328.9800000000005s)]
*  the Trump Stockholm syndrome and Trump derangement syndrome out [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5331.1s)]
*  of this just objectively. Yeah. Well, I thought I thought [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5334.18s)]
*  DeSantis had the best response, which is listen, if we spend our [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5338.86s)]
*  time relitigating January six and looking in the rearview [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5342.22s)]
*  mirror, we're gonna lose to Joe Biden. This is exactly the [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5345.26s)]
*  conversation and the debate that Democrats want us to be having. I [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5347.88s)]
*  think that's just factually true that if the Republican [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5351.78s)]
*  Party spends his time debating January six, that's playing into [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5354.62s)]
*  Biden's hands. So you don't think Trump can necessarily be [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5358.179999999999s)]
*  Biden that these other candidates have a better chance [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5362.099999999999s)]
*  of beating Biden? Is that what you didn't say that focusing [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5364.46s)]
*  focusing on relitigating? Okay, January six is not only is it a [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5368.099999999999s)]
*  waste of time, it's just a loser for Republicans. And by the way, [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5372.62s)]
*  it's Trump's worst quality to keep harkening back to the last [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5375.54s)]
*  election. Even I think his fans and supporters don't want to [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5379.06s)]
*  hear that. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5382.1s)]
*  Who has a better chance of winning some pairing of these [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5382.860000000001s)]
*  candidates, Sachs, or Trump and one of these candidates versus [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5386.02s)]
*  Biden heads up, you know, does something like DeSantis, Vivek or [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5390.22s)]
*  Halley and Vivek, you know, pick your combination here, have a [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5395.700000000001s)]
*  better chance versus Biden than Trump plus one of these. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5398.700000000001s)]
*  I think it's tough to say, but I do think that Trump has really [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5404.38s)]
*  high negatives. And in order for him to win the presidency, he's [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5408.98s)]
*  got to flip something like two or three out of five states, like [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5412.66s)]
*  swing states that voted against him last time. And I do think [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5417.219999999999s)]
*  that this is one of the stronger arguments that DeSantis makes is [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5421.339999999999s)]
*  that, you know, I could deliver those states, whereas Trump may [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5424.54s)]
*  not. So I think there is an electability argument for [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5428.379999999999s)]
*  DeSantis. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5432.9s)]
*  Okay. And so Friedberg, hearing all this, by the way, I'm not [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5433.94s)]
*  saying that that's what's going to happen. But I do think we [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5438.18s)]
*  know that Trump does have very high negatives. And yeah, he's [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5440.42s)]
*  gonna flip some states that he lost before. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5444.26s)]
*  He's gonna have a lot of Democrats and women come out to [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5446.3s)]
*  vote against him. He supercharges the base in the way [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5449.9400000000005s)]
*  Hillary charged the other way. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5452.34s)]
*  Can I say one other thing about DeSantis' performance in that [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5453.58s)]
*  debate? So I know that he doesn't stand out in the way [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5456.22s)]
*  that, you know, Vivek or some of these other candidates do [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5460.860000000001s)]
*  because he didn't deliver any zingers. And also, he wasn't the [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5463.62s)]
*  brunt of attack. I think we all thought that maybe there'd be a [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5467.06s)]
*  lot more incoming for him. And the incoming really went for [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5469.620000000001s)]
*  Vivek. But I think that he had a strategy in that debate. This is [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5472.14s)]
*  my interpretation. It's not based on any insider knowledge [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5476.660000000001s)]
*  or anything like that. Which was the way he answered questions [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5479.42s)]
*  was, I think, to be broadly acceptable to all the different [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5483.9800000000005s)]
*  factions in the GOP. So like I mentioned, there's kind of the [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5486.9800000000005s)]
*  MAGA faction, there's the neocon faction, and there's the [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5490.1s)]
*  religious right faction. And his answers may not have been the [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5493.46s)]
*  ones that were most loved by any of those factions. But I also [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5499.1s)]
*  think that none of his answers disqualified himself with any of [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5502.94s)]
*  those factions, which is kind of hard to do given how much they're [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5506.54s)]
*  at each other's throats. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5509.34s)]
*  So Sachs, if this was a poker tournament, and this was the [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5510.26s)]
*  final table, would you say the strategy for DeSantis was, Hey, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5512.9800000000005s)]
*  listen, I'm going to let these other guys shoot it out. I'm [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5517.9s)]
*  just gonna sit on my big chip stack here. I'm in second place. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5520.14s)]
*  You got let me let, let's let the field eliminate themselves. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5522.9s)]
*  I'm going to just protect my stack. I'm not going to play a [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5526.0199999999995s)]
*  lot of hands here. He's just sort of sitting and waiting for it [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5528.099999999999s)]
*  to get down to three or four people and then he'll mix it up [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5531.82s)]
*  some more. Is that the strategy? [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5533.54s)]
*  I think he came across as the grown up. Nobody really took [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5535.3s)]
*  swipes at him or shots at him. And he didn't really take shots [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5539.5s)]
*  to anybody else. He did, again, try to focus the Republican [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5541.7s)]
*  Party on what it's going to take to win. He was one of the only [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5544.7s)]
*  people on that stage who had criticism of Biden. I think it [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5548.42s)]
*  was a mistake not to criticize Biden's record. Yeah, that was [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5551.0199999999995s)]
*  shocked at that. That was such a weird thing that they were all [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5553.82s)]
*  going after Trump and nothing about Biden. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5556.5s)]
*  The only attacks on Biden that I even remember from that night [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5560.259999999999s)]
*  were from Trump's interview with Tucker where he criticized [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5562.66s)]
*  Oh God, he destroyed him. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5566.299999999999s)]
*  criticized Biden's lack of physical and mental acuity. But [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5567.7s)]
*  look, I think that if if the convention were ultimately to be [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5570.62s)]
*  a broker convention, which all the different factions of the [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5573.98s)]
*  GOP had to agree on a candidate, then I think DeSantis would be [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5576.459999999999s)]
*  that candidate because he may not be the candidate who is most [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5580.3s)]
*  loved by any of those factions. But I think he's made himself the [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5583.74s)]
*  most broadly acceptable to all of them. The problem is, I don't [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5586.860000000001s)]
*  think that's the way that candidates are chosen. You know, [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5589.9800000000005s)]
*  I think that what happens in practice is that the factions [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5592.46s)]
*  are trying to feed each other. And that one faction is going to [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5595.5s)]
*  win. And I think it's probably gonna be the MAGA faction. So [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5600.02s)]
*  that's the problem, I think, with this strategy. But look, he [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5602.860000000001s)]
*  came across the grown up and he came across as the most broadly [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5606.14s)]
*  acceptable. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5608.54s)]
*  Okay, so if this is a final table of a poker tournament, and [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5610.14s)]
*  Trump is going to sit down and debate three of these people [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5615.780000000001s)]
*  Chamath, who's going to be left to debate Trump and be the final [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5618.38s)]
*  three or four seats here? Which three? [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5623.58s)]
*  I think it'll be DeSantis, Vivek, and it'll be either Tim Scott or [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5626.22s)]
*  Nikki Haley. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5633.820000000001s)]
*  Interesting. Freeberg, who are the final three who are going to [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5634.660000000001s)]
*  debate Trump, you know, in debate number four or five? [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5637.26s)]
*  I don't know if he's going to show up. I don't know why he [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5640.5s)]
*  would if he's up 50, 60, 70% of the polls. I mean, it would be, [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5642.9800000000005s)]
*  it would just be such a Trump move to just not show up to any [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5647.54s)]
*  of these debates and just like get elected. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5651.1s)]
*  Play the game. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5653.02s)]
*  How incredible a debate would that be if it was Trump, DeSantis [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5653.58s)]
*  and Vivek? [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5656.66s)]
*  Firewall. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5658.5s)]
*  And then my fourth would be Nikki Haley. I think she did a [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5659.02s)]
*  good job. She had her moments in that debate. I think she had good [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5661.54s)]
*  advice for the Republican Party on the abortion issue. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5663.62s)]
*  Yeah, she did a really great job. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5666.66s)]
*  And spending. She pointed out how, you know, much money. I [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5668.06s)]
*  thought that was a tea party moment for her. That's when I [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5672.02s)]
*  warmed up to Nikki Haley a bunch. She's like, Listen, we also [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5673.9800000000005s)]
*  approved, you know, $6-8 trillion. We got to look at [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5677.5s)]
*  ourselves. And it was like, okay, is it the tea party 2010 [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5680.22s)]
*  here? I thought that was a great moment. Who do you who do you [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5682.820000000001s)]
*  have left? Freeberg? Everybody else played the game. Play along. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5685.26s)]
*  Who will be the final three here to debate Trump if Trump shows [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5687.820000000001s)]
*  up? Play along for the game. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5690.54s)]
*  I mean, Vivek seems to be in a good place. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5692.3s)]
*  Okay. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5695.46s)]
*  I don't know, DeSantis has a lot of money. Yeah, he's probably [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5697.54s)]
*  gonna stick around. Yeah. So Vivek and DeSantis are we all have [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5700.54s)]
*  consensus. I go with Nikki Haley. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5703.82s)]
*  I don't think he's gonna show up. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5707.58s)]
*  We got your we got your point. Yeah. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5709.34s)]
*  You're critical of the fact that Vivek is having a boom or surge [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5711.22s)]
*  based on his oratorical skills, which I think you regard as being [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5716.5s)]
*  a shallow way to a shallow way to choose a candidate. But you're [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5719.86s)]
*  showing no enthusiasm for DeSantis who actually has a [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5723.18s)]
*  track record of being the most capable executive. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5726.42s)]
*  Oh, no, no, I'm not. By the way, I didn't I'm not we're not [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5728.18s)]
*  talking about who I would vote for president. We even even have [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5730.62s)]
*  that comment. Like we didn't even ask that question once. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5732.62s)]
*  Okay, so we ask it now. Putting aside Trump, who do you pick? [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5734.820000000001s)]
*  What was really interesting is hearing the governors speak about [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5739.22s)]
*  their skills. I think Nikki Haley, Chris Christie, Bergham, [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5742.26s)]
*  DeSantis all had moments where they shine from from Hutchinson [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5746.780000000001s)]
*  from my perspective, from a content perspective, which is [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5750.66s)]
*  what I was talking about at the beginning, which people largely [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5753.38s)]
*  ignore, which is that they actually had quite a lot to draw [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5755.82s)]
*  from and, you know, policy that seemed pretty strong. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5758.7s)]
*  Here we go. Final question. Final question. I want you to [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5761.62s)]
*  give me your one and two, not Trump. Sax, we know DeSantis is [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5764.3s)]
*  number one for you. So then who's who's your number two to [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5768.58s)]
*  pair with him? Who would you pair with? [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5770.7s)]
*  Which to be what to be the candidate to be that the ticket [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5772.82s)]
*  Republican ticket, you're going to go to Santos one and then who [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5775.38s)]
*  do you put with them as the number two? [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5778.3s)]
*  Well, for me, DeSantis and I think that the only candidates [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5781.38s)]
*  who have acceptable answers on what I regard as the number one [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5786.94s)]
*  issue of our time, which is Ukraine, because that could [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5790.86s)]
*  lead to World War Three, the only candidates have acceptable [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5793.34s)]
*  answers are Trump, Vivek and DeSantis, meaning they've all [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5795.7s)]
*  been pretty clear they would deescalate. I think all the [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5799.0199999999995s)]
*  other candidates have basically indicated in one way or another [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5801.58s)]
*  that they would have to say DeSantis Vivek is those three [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5804.34s)]
*  candidates are the only ones are that are acceptable to me. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5806.78s)]
*  Okay, so we take Trump off if Trump doesn't run, which that's [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5808.9s)]
*  my personal belief, but just of the people who are on stage last [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5811.74s)]
*  night, you're going to Santos, Vivek is your ticket, Chamath, [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5813.62s)]
*  who's your ticket? After one debate, not counting Trump, if [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5816.82s)]
*  you if the Republican ticket, who do you think is Republican? [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5821.54s)]
*  Look, I like to buy these deep out of the money options. I will [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5823.54s)]
*  go out on the limb. I think that Vivek has a really good chance [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5825.98s)]
*  of winning this Republican nomination. That's what I saw. I [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5828.74s)]
*  saw like outright against Trump. Yeah, I [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5831.379999999999s)]
*  and we're taking Trump off the table. So just picking up for [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5834.179999999999s)]
*  example, for example, no, no, no, no, I really do think he's [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5836.74s)]
*  he can win this thing. And for example, I thought it was very [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5840.62s)]
*  clever when he said that he had a line he said, Donald Trump was [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5843.94s)]
*  the best. Let me be categorically clear. Donald Trump [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5849.219999999999s)]
*  was the best president of the 21st century. And I was like, [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5853.46s)]
*  what? And then I thought about it is and I thought, why is he [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5856.78s)]
*  saying it? Does he say it because he believes it? Or is he [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5860.54s)]
*  saying because it's like a tactic? And there's probably [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5862.9s)]
*  bits of both. Yep. Because I do think that there are elements [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5867.94s)]
*  where he fundamentally does believe that Trump has at least [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5871.42s)]
*  shined the path forward. And so I think he does believe it to [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5875.66s)]
*  some degree. But then I thought it's even smarter to have said [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5879.139999999999s)]
*  it. And again, this is where I go back to I'm not sure that [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5882.74s)]
*  that's oratory skills versus like, understanding, you know, [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5886.66s)]
*  game theory, strategy, and strategy and being a strategic [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5890.58s)]
*  thinker and trying to win. I thought that that was a very [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5894.42s)]
*  smart thing to have said. And all along that evening, I [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5897.0199999999995s)]
*  thought that he did the best job of preserving optionality for [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5900.66s)]
*  the Trump base to say, you know what, Vivek is all of the [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5905.7s)]
*  positive features of Trump without some of the negatives. So [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5910.7s)]
*  let's just clean up the ticket and let's go and I think there's [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5914.26s)]
*  still again, there's a long way. Yeah, I like the call. I like [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5917.1s)]
*  the call. But I would buy that deep out of the money option. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5920.900000000001s)]
*  And who's your number two, then? We're going one two here one [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5923.700000000001s)]
*  two, either as to pair with Vivek or your number two choice [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5926.26s)]
*  in terms of no, then I if Vivek doesn't figure out a way to [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5928.9400000000005s)]
*  slipstream pass Trump, the Trump will win the nomination. Okay, [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5933.54s)]
*  taking Trump out of the rest. Who's your number two? Okay, [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5936.620000000001s)]
*  great. Fascinating to see this happening. I agree with what a [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5940.18s)]
*  lot of what Jamal said. I think Vivek is positioning himself [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5942.780000000001s)]
*  to be the backup candidate for the MAGA wing. Yep. And he's [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5948.06s)]
*  doing it by never attacking Trump and by complimenting him. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5952.820000000001s)]
*  By the way, saying that Trump was the best president of the 21st [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5956.42s)]
*  century, there's only been three. It was George W. Bush, [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5959.34s)]
*  Obama, and then Trump. Sorry, Biden. Sorry, Biden. So there's [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5962.18s)]
*  been four. George W. Bush was one of the worst presidents in [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5966.26s)]
*  American history. So it's either Obama or Trump. Obviously, a [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5969.780000000001s)]
*  Republican candidate is not going to think highly of Obama [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5973.82s)]
*  or Biden. So it kind of narrows it down, doesn't it? Yeah, what [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5977.18s)]
*  was the intelligence of actually saying the words? Yeah, [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5980.7s)]
*  strategically brilliant. Yeah, no, I agree. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5984.98s)]
*  Sax, what do you think about Vivek's unpopular statement? And [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5987.0599999999995s)]
*  it may I'd like to hear whether it's unpopular with the base, [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5990.54s)]
*  but it was certainly unpopular in the room last night, that the [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5993.14s)]
*  climate change agenda is a hoax, which drew a lot of booze. That [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5995.54s)]
*  was that like, is that a lightning bolt kind of thing to [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=5999.74s)]
*  say? Why would he say that? And what's the strategy? [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6004.5s)]
*  It's like Trump saying he loves coal. He loves coal miners. It's [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6008.9s)]
*  just felt to me a little bit like he was trying to say the [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6012.9s)]
*  agenda is a hoax, meaning like all the ESG stuff is nonsense. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6015.34s)]
*  But it comes across as him saying climate change isn't real. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6018.94s)]
*  And he's got to now deal with the change is strategic. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6021.9s)]
*  I think it's I don't think you know what he believes, J. Cal. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6026.22s)]
*  But yeah, his follow up comment around that was he said that it [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6030.66s)]
*  is an economic yoke on our country. Because the combination [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6033.7s)]
*  of subsidies and the lack of expansion of carbon is what's [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6038.42s)]
*  holding back the country economically. So that's I think [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6042.66s)]
*  I remember him tying these two things together. So that's [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6045.54s)]
*  probably where the same [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6048.54s)]
*  no intelligent person doesn't believe that the planet's not [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6049.3s)]
*  heating up, come on. And that it's not better to go to [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6051.820000000001s)]
*  renewables. That's just how do you know if you looked at the [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6054.7s)]
*  science, J. Cal? Of course I have. Yes, it's massive. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6056.74s)]
*  You've gone deep on the science. You know, as deep as a person [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6059.42s)]
*  needs to go free bird. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6062.46s)]
*  You just treat it. Look, it's just something you're supposed [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6064.98s)]
*  to believe in. No, I'm not saying that I don't believe it. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6066.98s)]
*  How the planet has gotten warmer. That's it. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6070.74s)]
*  I will say Sachs is right. That it has become a thing that it's [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6073.0599999999995s)]
*  like we're all supposed to take as given. No one is going to go [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6077.46s)]
*  up and say, here's the science that validates. Here's the data [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6080.98s)]
*  that validates. Here's there's some empirical evidence and then [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6084.22s)]
*  people use counter empirical evidence to try and counter it. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6086.54s)]
*  And that's what makes it a little bit of a movement now, [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6089.3s)]
*  which is the institutions, the elites, however, they're framed [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6092.780000000001s)]
*  have been wrong so many times on the things that they told us [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6097.740000000001s)]
*  were given that we're supposed to assume that this is a given [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6100.22s)]
*  to F that I'm not going to be what to believe anymore. And I [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6102.9400000000005s)]
*  don't want to be told what to believe anymore is exactly what [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6107.22s)]
*  people let me let me state my position. That's what they heard [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6109.42s)]
*  from that song last week. And that's what they heard. You [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6111.78s)]
*  know, in the statement, I totally agree. Yeah. Here's the [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6114.9s)]
*  thing. After COVID without me even making a comment on climate [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6118.179999999999s)]
*  change. 100% we were told so much bullshit in the name of [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6121.66s)]
*  science during COVID. They told us that we're safe and effective. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6125.46s)]
*  I just want to clarify my position before you respond to [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6129.74s)]
*  it. It's undeniable that temperatures have risen. I think [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6131.5s)]
*  it's a crazy experiment to run to not try to lower it. It's just [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6135.74s)]
*  a crazy experiment. The planet is precious. I don't think we [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6140.22s)]
*  should run it. I am not dogmatic about it. It's not a religious [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6143.34s)]
*  thing. I'm not general experiment. We're running [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6146.46s)]
*  Jake, it's called human development and growth. And the [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6148.46s)]
*  temperature goes up. So why wouldn't we use renewable nuclear [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6152.9400000000005s)]
*  when not pollute because not polluting is is good too. When [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6156.9800000000005s)]
*  you have [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6160.900000000001s)]
*  self proclaimed scientific experts and or 16 year old girls [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6163.54s)]
*  shaming everybody [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6170.3s)]
*  with pretty flimsy data. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6173.3s)]
*  There was a while where we were everybody just said ma, they must [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6176.26s)]
*  be right. And COVID exposed the hoax. And so now we're a lot [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6178.9800000000005s)]
*  less prone to believe these self proclaimed intellectuals and [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6183.66s)]
*  their jargon and their nonsense. So ask me how much money have I [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6188.1s)]
*  invested in climate change with all that data? Zero. Ask me how [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6194.1s)]
*  much money I've invested in technologies that will benefit [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6198.66s)]
*  climate change as a byproduct of national security, hundreds of [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6201.78s)]
*  millions of dollars. Yes. And the reason I give you that [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6204.66s)]
*  example is that, for me, that framing was just such a turnoff [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6207.3s)]
*  because I couldn't buy into it. Yeah, there are multiple reasons [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6212.0199999999995s)]
*  and the more pragmatic, realistic framing, which allowed [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6215.58s)]
*  us to actually say maybe you're right, but maybe you're wrong. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6219.26s)]
*  But let's not even debate the issue. Let's just go and make [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6222.34s)]
*  sure we're not dependent on another country and fighting [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6224.58s)]
*  endless wars. That got me off my ass to do stuff. And I think [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6226.42s)]
*  there's a lot of people in America that are in that second [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6229.46s)]
*  category, they don't want absolutely emotionally riddled [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6232.26s)]
*  dogma to drive their life and how they're forced to make [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6235.3s)]
*  decisions. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6237.9800000000005s)]
*  You can come up with three or four really good reasons to not [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6238.7s)]
*  keep burning fossil fuels. They're dirty. They're [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6243.06s)]
*  pollutants. There are better options that are more [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6245.9800000000005s)]
*  sustainable that are more cost effective, it's more cost [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6249.06s)]
*  effective to put solar in than to burn coal or build a new coal [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6251.34s)]
*  plant. So there's economic reasons and then there's of [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6255.219999999999s)]
*  course, hold on, let me finish those points. No, what we're [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6257.299999999999s)]
*  saying is we're not automatically gonna trust. I [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6259.86s)]

*  I'm not blindly trusting anybody. I'm taking the body of [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6265.86s)]

*  believe you've gone deep on this issue. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6272.74s)]
*  Okay, anyway. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6274.5s)]
*  I haven't gone deep on this issue. That's all I'm saying. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6275.299999999999s)]
*  I'm not in a position to agree or disagree with you. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6278.139999999999s)]
*  If you listen, as opposed to telling me what I think and [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6280.82s)]
*  listen to what I'm telling you, there are many reasons to pursue [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6284.0599999999995s)]
*  sustainable energy, clean energy, and geopolitics is one [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6288.86s)]
*  of them. And, you know, polluting the environment is one [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6292.62s)]
*  of them and temperatures rising if that indeed results in [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6295.9s)]
*  damages to the oceans and you know, weather patterns, there [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6299.299999999999s)]
*  are five or six great reasons to stop burning coal and stop [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6303.98s)]
*  burning oil. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6308.58s)]
*  Look at these two climate whitewashers we're living in in [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6309.62s)]
*  this moment. People were so convinced they just needed to [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6312.66s)]
*  roil the country around the hurricane hitting California. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6316.7s)]
*  Then by the time it landed, it was a storm. It was rain in Los [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6320.94s)]
*  Angeles. I asked people here when I got here, I said, how is [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6324.7s)]
*  hurricane? They're like, it wasn't a hurricane. And in fact, [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6327.3s)]
*  the news were so tilted about it, they had to call it it could [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6330.26s)]
*  have been a hurricane. Yeah, they could wait in store [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6333.86s)]
*  ratings. Second is this thing in Maui. It turns out Michael [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6336.0599999999995s)]
*  Schellenberger has done some pretty good work on this is [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6340.42s)]
*  exposing that a lot of the reason these fires may have [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6343.22s)]
*  started was because of this radical climate agenda that [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6346.02s)]
*  caused the utility to not invest in the protective measures they [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6349.86s)]
*  should have around power lines. That is crazy, Jason. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6354.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I'm not defending what happened in Maui. It's obviously [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6358.54s)]
*  incompetence. We should be bearing we have the same issue in [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6361.46s)]
*  California, which is wind dogmatic belief. There's a [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6364.1s)]
*  consequence. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6366.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm not a dogmatic believer. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6368.26s)]
*  No, I'm not saying you are. I'm just trying to make. I'm not [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6369.0199999999995s)]
*  saying you are. I'm trying to make this point. When people [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6372.0199999999995s)]
*  dogmatically believe bodies of evidence that they themselves [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6374.54s)]
*  don't interrogate fully, they may it may lead them to [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6377.3s)]
*  conclusions and then actions that you are now seeing have [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6380.58s)]
*  measurable human consequences. If you look at PG&E in [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6383.58s)]
*  California, it's riddled with these issues. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6386.38s)]
*  Yeah, they shut our power off because they're afraid that wind [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6388.58s)]
*  is going to blow down power lines and start fires. Yeah, I [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6391.26s)]
*  mean, and we just need to bury them. So [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6393.46s)]
*  so I think that it would be great to like not debate the [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6395.7s)]
*  climate issue, put a pin in it and instead just say, we all [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6397.9800000000005s)]
*  want our kids to be able to have clean air around us, clean water [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6401.46s)]
*  to drink. And we want to make sure that we have the resources [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6405.38s)]
*  to be productive as human beings without having to send our kids [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6408.66s)]
*  to war, or without putting the country in danger. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6411.58s)]
*  100% which is exactly my point. There's so many reasons to take [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6414.1s)]
*  this seriously and move to renewables and nuclear. All [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6418.04s)]
*  right, listen, this has been an insanely great episode. Hey, [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6420.42s)]
*  let me just get one person's comments. So here's your here's [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6423.82s)]
*  your red meat for sacks here. It sounds like there was the the [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6428.06s)]
*  coup 60 days later, the guy who was running the coup in Russia [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6433.58s)]
*  had a little accident so random. Maybe your thoughts? Sacks? [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6438.34s)]
*  You're talking about for Goshen? [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6443.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he had some mechanical difficulties on his [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6445.3s)]
*  PJ. I don't know what happened. Is he not sending that citation [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6448.14s)]
*  in for maintenance? What happened? They had a bad engine [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6450.78s)]
*  or something? It's so random. Poor guy. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6452.7s)]
*  The latest reporting from the New York Times this morning is [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6454.82s)]
*  that for Goshen's plane was not shot shot down, but rather they [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6456.74s)]
*  believe there was an explosive device on it. Oh, so we don't [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6459.9s)]
*  know. You know, we don't we don't know exactly. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6463.26s)]
*  I think it was a bird strike, something random like a bird [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6466.3s)]
*  strike. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6468.38s)]
*  No, not somebody took him out. Somebody took him off the board. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6468.7s)]
*  Really? Oh, must have been must have been Ukraine, right? That [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6471.78s)]
*  that's what you're putting it on. It's Ukraine. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6474.7s)]
*  No, I mean, I think it's probably pretty obvious who did [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6476.46s)]
*  it, although we won't know for sure. Say the name. Listen, I [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6480.26s)]
*  think that allegedly, allegedly, that's what you always say [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6486.06s)]
*  whenever 100 Biden's accused of doing something you always have [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6492.22s)]
*  to insert allegedly, there was a little cocaine and maybe some [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6494.38s)]
*  bribes. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6497.700000000001s)]
*  I think this resolves the question of who came out on top [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6498.66s)]
*  during that mutiny. There were a lot of people speculating that [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6501.780000000001s)]
*  somehow progosha had the upper hand or he was paid off or that [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6505.66s)]
*  was not cool, right? Remember, there was a line of thinking, Oh, [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6508.86s)]
*  this wasn't a coup. If it wasn't a coup, then why did Putin [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6510.82s)]
*  whack him? [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6514.42s)]
*  Black black. And it was exactly 60 days later. Is that correct? [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6516.299999999999s)]
*  That was the other thing is that can ask a question. How funny is [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6520.179999999999s)]
*  it that it's like, Putin's like, hey, progosha and come come and [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6522.7s)]
*  see me. We're good. Nothing to worry about. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6525.5s)]
*  And then it's like, listen, where are you going to a block [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6530.94s)]
*  You can take my PJ. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6533.3s)]
*  How does this happen? Like, you can't even write this stuff. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6537.34s)]
*  Freyberg is sending his PJ to take me down to the orange [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6540.58s)]
*  summit. Oh, thanks for the ride. Freyberg. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6543.14s)]
*  I told you it's like Michael Corleone. Apparently, there's a [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6544.9800000000005s)]
*  meeting about a month ago. I remember it being reported where [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6548.34s)]
*  progosha and the other heads of Wagner came to meet with Putin. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6551.34s)]
*  And the deal that Putin supposedly offered was that Wagner [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6555.02s)]
*  could stay together but had to report to the Russian military. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6559.42s)]
*  And the Wagner commanders were on board with it. But one person [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6562.26s)]
*  objected and that was pregosha. Oh, so it's a little bit like [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6566.0199999999995s)]
*  remember that the meeting between Michael Corleone and Mo [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6568.94s)]
*  Green in Vegas? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, Michael's like, think [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6571.74s)]
*  of a price and Mo Green's like, you don't buy me out. I buy you [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6575.78s)]
*  ride. That kind of reaction. Yeah. And the guy had some sort [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6579.62s)]
*  of death wish, I guess. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6584.179999999999s)]
*  You know what they say? Beware the dog that doesn't bark. Putin [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6585.46s)]
*  said nothing for the last two months. He was like, Yeah, it's [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6589.0599999999995s)]
*  all good. Nothing out of the Putin camp. And then boom. Putin [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6591.3s)]
*  is a murderous lunatic who must be stopped and contained. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6595.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, I think that's the opposite of being a lunatic. I [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6599.54s)]
*  think this is somebody who is very cold and calculating. Okay, [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6601.820000000001s)]
*  yeah. Murderous calculated sociopath. He figured out how [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6604.7s)]
*  to defuse a mutiny. I don't think it was a full on coup. But [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6607.74s)]
*  a mutiny that would have been very disruptive to his frontline [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6611.54s)]
*  if he had basically tried to violently suppress it. So he [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6614.74s)]
*  cuts a deal where basically he offers banishment to Belarus. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6617.42s)]
*  Pogosian was supposed to go to Belarus. By the way, we don't [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6623.42s)]
*  know exactly why Pogosian returned to Moscow or St. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6625.9800000000005s)]
*  Petersburg. He was supposed to be staying in Belarus or Africa. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6630.26s)]
*  So maybe he violated the terms of his probation. We don't know. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6633.7s)]
*  There are all these people on social media who are pinning [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6636.3s)]
*  their hopes for regime change and liberal reform within Russia [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6638.9400000000005s)]
*  on Pogosian, which was always absurd because he was this war [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6643.26s)]
*  lord whose behavior and conduct was even more erratic and violent [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6646.9s)]
*  than Putin. So he was never going to be a great vessel for [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6652.379999999999s)]
*  liberal reform in Russia. Nonetheless, there are all these [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6655.099999999999s)]
*  people who pin their hopes for regime change in Russia on [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6658.66s)]
*  Pogosian. We can see now what a stupid idea that was. The Russian [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6661.54s)]
*  regime, whether you like it or not, is stable. It is not [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6666.58s)]
*  unstable. Russia is winning the war. And you may hate Putin, but [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6669.179999999999s)]
*  he is still master of Russia. And eventually, we're gonna have [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6674.0199999999995s)]
*  to deal with him. These fantasies that we're going to be [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6676.62s)]
*  able to regime change him, I think are absurd. And they've [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6679.54s)]
*  led us to this horrible point. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6683.66s)]
*  Okay, for the dictator for the Sultan of science and focused [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6684.9s)]
*  sassacks with the slick back hair. I am the World's Great [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6690.0599999999995s)]
*  See you next time. Bye bye. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6694.66s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPiRgEVvlKE&t=6724.66s)]
