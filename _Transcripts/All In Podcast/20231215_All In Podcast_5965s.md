**All In Podcast:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0)
*  We're going mullet this week in honor of your, your closest to mullet right now, Saks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=0.0s)]
*  I see you trying to tuck the lettuce in. It's not going to work. We see it back there. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Well, I need the ponytail. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=9.92s)]
*  Wow. You went full knot. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=11.28s)]
*  Where is this photo from? Do you have like a secret camera in his room? What is this? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=13.68s)]
*  No, my kids took it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=17.44s)]
*  Are you really doing a douche knot? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=20.0s)]
*  One of my daughters is playing with my hair. She wants to see if she can make a ponytail with it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  So she made a ponytail and then took a photo. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=25.68s)]
*  That's elite. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=27.92s)]
*  We sent it into chat to ask who it looked like and it said Thomas Jefferson. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=28.16s)]
*  Just serious question. Did you do a fit check with Tucker on that? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=32.4s)]
*  Did you send him that and say fit check? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=35.44s)]
*  Not everything has to do with Tucker, J. Cal. The joke's going wild. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=38.0s)]
*  Look at the smile. If you guys don't know what a fit check is, ask your daughters. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Oh, wait. What check? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=44.0s)]
*  A fit check. You take a picture of yourself, you send it to your friends, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=45.36s)]
*  you say fit check and then they tell you if you look good for the day. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=49.36s)]
*  Oh, okay. It's kind of like a wellness check, but for how you look for fashion. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=51.92s)]
*  Yeah. It's like when Friedberg send you, I'm having anxiety about this. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=57.04s)]
*  And then we do a wellness check on Friedberg, see who's going to show up for the show. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=60.32s)]
*  Or we do a wellness check on you and Alex Jones comes back to Twitter. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=63.52s)]
*  I'm putting it out there right now. And Alex Jones is on the back half of the show, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=67.28s)]
*  just to tease it. Just like I'm going to tease these photos. I pulled the archives and here I am [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=70.72s)]
*  in 1984 with my mullet. That's a J. Cal mullet from 1984 in Staten Island on the way to a boy [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=76.4s)]
*  scout trip. But I thought we'd have a little fun. Sats actually has been working. He's got his [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=82.88s)]
*  hairstylist. Yeah. Well, the gray looks like a Lord of the Rings character. Like an Elfen warrior. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=88.72s)]
*  No, he looks like the Elfen warrior. Exactly. So we'll punch that up. But your mom actually, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=95.92s)]
*  surprisingly, surprisingly, I can't look. That's horrible. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=101.52s)]
*  You're not getting away untouched. Here it is. Friedberg looks like a Berkeley. He looks like [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=107.76s)]
*  Orlando Bloom in Lord of the Rings, right? Actually, it looks like more like that vampire movie. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=115.28s)]
*  What was it that? He does look like interview with the vampire or he looks like he's teaching [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  gender studies at Berkeley and his non-binary. So if you want to take [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  understanding non-binary as their gender studies 101, it's coming this spring. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  Friedberg should be teaching on his alma mater. Well done. I'll send you guys a photo. I did have [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=135.84s)]
*  a ponytail. I sported it from about age 16 to 19 when I smoked cigarettes too. And I've got photos [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=140.56s)]
*  with the ponytail and the trench coat smoking cigs. So it fits the mold. All right. So in the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=146.16s)]
*  spirit of mullets, let's go business first. And we will go to the party at the end. Let's get started, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=151.92000000000002s)]

*  door to my gate. I opened the gate. The guy drives in, he gets out. He's like a big guy kind of says, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=264.8s)]
*  Mr. Friedberg. And I'm like, what am I getting served? And he goes to the backseat. And I'm like, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=270.08s)]

*  he drove away. What is he sure? It was like when you go to an amount he did the amount thing that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=287.68s)]
*  they do. That wasn't his father. That was his valet. That's his valet. He stole the valet from [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=293.2s)]
*  the amount. It was the most thoughtful no show I've ever had. I will say sex. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=298.72s)]
*  Okay. Well, I'm glad to hear that. I'm glad to hear that. Well, what's funny is, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=303.36s)]
*  I just checked my inbox and my invitation from you is sitting in there. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=307.6s)]
*  Because I've been meaning to go, but I didn't realize it was so soon. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=311.92s)]
*  So I'm just looking at the date. It was December 9th. I didn't realize it was five days ago. Sorry [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=315.68s)]
*  about that. Someone in your household did. So we appreciate it. Someone knew. I went, but this is my [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=320.0s)]
*  second or third year going. So I pre I pregame that I went and I got protein. I got meat, a bunch of [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=325.28s)]
*  steak and a burger. And then I went and sure enough, I talked to the staff. And the staff said, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=333.12s)]
*  after much debate, and haranguing with free bird, he allowed cheese this year, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=340.08s)]
*  you're allowed to sushi with a whole sushi platter. No stop. You didn't have sushi. Okay, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=345.6s)]
*  it's now my turn to tell the truth. Go ahead. Tell the truth. I get in the car to drive 90 minutes, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  90 minutes to free for that. Okay. That's the poker trip for me by the way. But yeah, and I, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=355.2s)]
*  Nat, texts, Allison and David were on our way. Jamal wants to know, will there be meat? Because [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm driving, so I can't text. And Ali says, Oh yeah, don't worry. There'll be sushi. And the Nat [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=367.84s)]
*  texts back, okay, we just got off the highway. We're going home. We'll see you later. Because we [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=375.52s)]
*  don't believe says there's going to be fish. Fine. I get there. Haven't eaten the thing. I am starving. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=378.64s)]
*  Ravenous. I start to work my way through the appetizers. There's like, sliced green peppers [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=384.88s)]
*  and red peppers. There's like some falafels. Then there was a Spanish omelet. All pretty decent. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=390.79999999999995s)]
*  Okay. And I'm like, where's the sushi? And so Phil Deutch says, 1000 bucks, there's no sushi. And I [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=395.35999999999996s)]
*  said, no, there's free. Bert texted me. He said, I've asked all the people working here. They say [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=401.52s)]
*  there's no sushi. So I bet him a thousand dollars. I go outside to where the sushi is. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  And you know how we used to make fun of sky for having the filler fruit at the poker? Yeah. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=413.91999999999996s)]
*  Cantaloupe, cantaloupe and honeydew. And that's all there was. Yeah. There was no sushi, but there [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=418.79999999999995s)]
*  was two or three rolls with four pieces of salmon strategically cut, just laying over. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=423.92s)]
*  I won the bet. I was so hungry. I was like, what do I eat? I'm starving. So I keep eating the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=432.24s)]
*  omelet. I keep eating the vegetarian food. And then I see these brownies and I'm like, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=438.24s)]
*  I'll just have a brownie. Then I had two brownies. And then I was like, okay, I need to stop. I can't [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=444.08000000000004s)]
*  have this. I'm still so hungry. I walk outside J Cal where I saw you. We're having a couple [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=448.8s)]
*  of coffee and you know what? I ate five baklava. And then I was like, this is disgusting. I've had [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=453.6s)]
*  no protein. I've had no carbohydrates. I've had no fiber. I've had a fucking 3000 calories of sugar. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=460.16s)]
*  I grabbed Nat and I charged home. I was so bad. He did. He Irish mad. I didn't see him say goodbye. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=466.08000000000004s)]
*  Irish goodbye. Free burger. And I talked about it yesterday. We talked it out. But I was rude. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=470.8s)]
*  I must've had 6000 calories at his Christmas party. I'm coming over to Tim off tonight. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=475.36s)]
*  It's only going to be tritip the whole night. I'm sure not a civil insight. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=480.72s)]
*  It sounds like J Cal preloaded the meat. He did. He got ready. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=484.64000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely. I on the way. No, seriously after last year, last year I left that party [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=488.08000000000004s)]
*  and I just typed in, I just said to my guys to go to Popeye's closest in and out burger. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=492.8s)]
*  And I literally got a double double. And then I just had a second one on the way up this time. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=497.76s)]
*  I literally had a steak for dinner and then I went and then I too had some. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=503.44s)]
*  Have you guys ever had Popeyes? Of course. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=506.8s)]
*  I had never had it. My son asked to get it last week. Last weekend. I'd never had it. Can you [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=509.84s)]
*  believe it? Here we go. It is the most incredible thing I've ever tasted. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=515.04s)]
*  Wow. Wait for the out of touch YouTube comments. The problem is not the eating of it. It's how you [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=520.4s)]
*  feel two hours later. I mean, I've had Chick-fil-A, you know, I've done the chicken sandwiches at other [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=526.9599999999999s)]
*  places. Never Popeyes is incredible. Incredible. So then I had not almost on the edge of convincing [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=531.68s)]
*  her to go to Popeyes on the way home, but we missed the closing time. So we couldn't get it. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=541.52s)]
*  I got go to starboard or bonchan. Those are two other elite. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=546.0s)]
*  No, bro, not not I'm not talking fancy chicken. I've had like the fancy chicken sandwiches. I'm [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=549.5999999999999s)]
*  saying Popeyes is incredible. I like it. I like it. Austerity. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=553.8399999999999s)]
*  Chema. Here we go. Have you had a flay of fish? All right, let's get the show started here. Of [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=558.72s)]
*  course, with me again. The king of beep, the dictator and the rain man. Let's get to work. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=562.8s)]
*  All right, everybody epic. The makers of Fortnite just won a huge case. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=569.04s)]
*  With Google over the play app store on Android phones. For those of you don't know, app stores [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=574.16s)]
*  have become an absolutely huge business for Apple and Google. Google App Store generates $50 billion [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=578.16s)]
*  of revenue a year. Now that's about 17% of Google's total revenue. Apple's App Store and [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=585.6800000000001s)]
*  Services 85 billion in annual revenue. These are on top of their franchises of hardware and search. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=591.52s)]
*  The jury in San Francisco, unanimously found that Google violated California's federal antitrust laws [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=598.64s)]
*  through sweetheart deals and annoying workarounds that stifled competition. For example, Google got [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=604.8000000000001s)]
*  spooked that other game developers would follow epics lead and launch their own app stores or [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=611.6s)]
*  route people directly to their websites to avoid the 30% take rate. Some might call it a tax. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=617.36s)]
*  Google calculated they would lose 2 billion to 3.5 billion in revenue annually if the other major [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=623.6800000000001s)]
*  game developers followed epic. So they created a program codenamed project hug, where they [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=630.48s)]
*  basically paid out bribes or incentives to discourage large developers from building their [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=636.48s)]
*  own competitive app stores. They also gave Spotify sweetheart deal of 0%. And Google paid activation [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=641.2s)]
*  $360 million to keep in the play store. And the discovery in this case was absolutely wild. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=648.32s)]
*  According to testimony in the trial, Google had deleted some employees chat logs. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=656.5600000000001s)]
*  And the judge told the jury to assume that the deleted information wouldn't have been favorable [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=661.76s)]
*  to Google. Drill only deliberated a few hours. And Google plans to appeal the verdict, obviously. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=666.0s)]
*  Epic isn't seeking damages. They just want Google to change their practices. They want to basically [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=673.12s)]
*  let people plug in their own billing system to avoid the 30% tax. We'll see what happens next [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=678.64s)]
*  freeburg. These stores clearly have monopolistic characteristics, but [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=683.84s)]
*  and Google actually allows for third party app stores, maybe you can explain why you think Apple [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=689.68s)]
*  won their case against epic, but Google lost. These are pretty different cases. The Apple case [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=695.04s)]
*  was a judge. This one was a jury of citizens in federal court. I think it's worth just backing up [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=700.8s)]
*  a minute and talking about the history of like apps on phones and how Android came to be. Prior [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=710.0799999999999s)]
*  to Google acquiring Android, you guys may remember there were a few companies that were the dominant [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=714.8s)]
*  OS providers, operating system providers to mobile phones. There was Nokia, there was Microsoft, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=719.76s)]
*  there was Apple, and there was also BlackBerry. And at the time, a lot of the telcos, the Verizon [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=726.4s)]
*  and AT&Ts of the world prior to this were trying to make money by charging for people to install [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=733.68s)]
*  apps on phones. So that was the first business model in the mobile internet was the telco would [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=738.4799999999999s)]
*  make money and everyone fought against it. All the open internet providers said this is ridiculous. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=743.52s)]
*  And it was clear that that was not going to be allowed. So ultimately, these operating systems [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=748.32s)]
*  became the play and which operating system was on which mobile phone and what did that operating [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=752.88s)]
*  system then allow to control what apps were allowed and so on. So the reason Google bought [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=757.7600000000001s)]
*  Android is they wanted to make an open source alternative to all of these closed app and closed [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=762.1600000000001s)]
*  systems. So Google bought Android 2005, made a huge investment in growing the team and allowed [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=767.44s)]
*  anyone to use the Android OS, fork it, make their own versions of it, install it on their [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=773.76s)]
*  own hardware, run it however they wanted. Meanwhile, Google made an internal version [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=778.8s)]
*  of Android that could be used on any mobile handset company's phone as a pre-installed OS. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=783.8399999999999s)]
*  Now, why did Google want to do this? They wanted to do this number one to make sure that the [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=789.04s)]
*  internet was still open and it wasn't going to end up being closed from a user's perspective. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=792.7199999999999s)]
*  And number two, so that anyone can install any app they wanted. And the commercial interest for [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=797.28s)]
*  Google, which is number three, is so that Google could make search, Google search the default search [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=801.84s)]
*  engine on that phone and have YouTube installed and all these other tools that Google makes money on, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=806.24s)]
*  including their own app store. Now in Android, anyone can install any app they want on the phone. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=810.96s)]
*  And so there's no restrictions unlike in Apple. In the iOS, if you try and download an app off [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=817.9200000000001s)]
*  the internet and install it, it has to go through the app store. It has to be Apple verified in [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=824.08s)]
*  order to be allowed on the phone. So the whole point of Android was that it could be open, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=827.6s)]
*  anyone could install anything. What Epic claimed in this case was that Google's Android OS gave [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=830.88s)]
*  people security warnings. So if you ever have tried this, you download an app from a website [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=837.12s)]
*  on Android. It says warning, warning, this may cause a virus on your phone. Are you sure you want [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=841.04s)]
*  to do this? This app hasn't been verified by Google, et cetera, et cetera. So it gives these [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=846.08s)]
*  warnings that scare consumers off of doing that. So Epic, you can install Fortnite direct on your [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=850.32s)]
*  Android phone today and you can do it by downloading it from Epic's website. You don't have to go [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=855.12s)]
*  through the Google Play Store and you can enter your credit card and you can pay for stuff. So [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=859.36s)]
*  it is an open system that allows that. What these guys are claiming is that because Google can [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=863.52s)]
*  default the Google Play Store on the phone, it's basically what most consumers are going to use [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=868.5600000000001s)]
*  anyway. And so they're saying it's not fair. And because they also have influence over the OS [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=872.5600000000001s)]
*  and they're putting these security warnings, it's inappropriate because now it's scaring [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=876.96s)]
*  people from downloading stuff off the internet. So that's the big claim Epic's making. So Google [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=880.16s)]
*  has already said they're going to appeal this case because fundamentally, again, if this were [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=884.08s)]
*  really true and there really was deep antitrust issues with this, you would likely have seen a [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=888.16s)]
*  federal agency come after Google, not a private company suing them in a civil case. This would [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=892.16s)]
*  have been a much more significant action if there really was antitrust behavior. But it's a lot [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=898.16s)]
*  easier to win a jury trial party to party where Epic can go to a court and say, hey, let's go [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=902.56s)]
*  after Google. They're awful. We make Fortnite and all this sort of stuff. So they do have a bias in [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=906.9599999999999s)]
*  that sense of being able to do this. Google's going to appeal. They feel very strongly they'll [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=910.8s)]
*  win an appeal. And the markets obviously voted with the fact that Google stock didn't really move [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=914.4s)]
*  anywhere. And the market said, hey, this is a nothing burger. Google's $40 billion in annual [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=920.88s)]
*  Play Store revenue. Worst case scenario, like you said, if it gets impacted by $2 billion, that's [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=926.0799999999999s)]
*  $2 billion out of $300 overall. It doesn't really matter. And likely they're going to win on appeal [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=930.72s)]
*  anyway. So I think the saga will continue. But I think Google's got a pretty strong case on appeal. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=935.28s)]
*  And it seems like, you know, it's going to be very hard to kind of see a massive change in [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=940.8s)]
*  App Store behavior as a result of this case, even though it's been hyped up to be that. That's my [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=945.1999999999999s)]
*  take on it. Yeah, great take. Chamath, what do you think about this jury shopping and maybe the fact [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=948.9599999999999s)]
*  that this isn't Lena cons isn't the FTC, you know, it's company to company, do you think that the [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=954.64s)]
*  claims here were valid? Do you think the jury shopping impacted this in a significant way? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=959.8399999999999s)]
*  Probably, I guess the simple thought exercise is what do we think the outcome would have been had [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=965.3599999999999s)]
*  this trial happened in Dallas, Texas? Probably different. And so I think Freeberg is right, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=969.52s)]
*  what does it materially prove nothing with respect to the body of law, it just goes to show [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=977.28s)]
*  that if you pick the right place to convene these trials, in the right format, you can give [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=983.28s)]
*  yourself a slightly better probability of winning. But the question is, what will you win? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=989.68s)]
*  It's not clear to me what happens now, is there going to be a damages portion now of this trial? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=993.84s)]
*  Is that what happens next? They're not seeking damages, they want changes to how they operate, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1000.08s)]
*  and they're trying to get a settlement. And they want Google to settle out with changes to the [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1005.2s)]
*  App Store policies. That's what they're asking for. And then what about the epic versus Apple [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1009.6s)]
*  lawsuit? Is it being done in the same way? No, they lost, they lost, and they appealed. And there's [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1014.08s)]
*  one element that's being appealed to the Supreme Court now, but basically they lost and that's over. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1018.4000000000001s)]
*  And that was that convened in California in a jury trial as well in San Francisco? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1022.96s)]
*  No, that was not a jury trial. It was a judge. And it was California. It was a bench trial in [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1027.68s)]
*  California. Yeah, it was also in Northern California. That's right. Yeah. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1034.16s)]
*  So, Sachs, let me bring you in on this. Do you think that these stores are monopolies? And do [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1038.72s)]
*  you think if they change their behavior, especially Apple, you know, allow other third party stores, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1044.0s)]
*  what impact would that have on the startup ecosystem? Because the 30% tax is significant, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1048.96s)]
*  and we see that every day with our startups. I mean, if you have to give away 30% of your revenue [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1053.3600000000001s)]
*  to Google and Apple, it's brutal. And then you're advertising on Apple and Google and Facebook. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1058.88s)]
*  That's another 30% of your revenue or 50% of your revenue. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1064.48s)]
*  Yeah. No, I agree with that. So first of all, these app stores are absolutely monopolies within [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1067.92s)]
*  their ecosystem. And Apple and Google Android are absolutely a duopoly within the mobile space. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1073.04s)]
*  My experience with these types of monopolies or gatekeepers is that they exercise more and [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1081.6s)]
*  more control and extract more and more of the value over time. It's an iterative process [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1086.48s)]
*  in which they just keep, you know, extracting, keep taxing, keep imposing more rules on the ecosystem [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1091.84s)]
*  for their benefit and to the detriment of innovators. And so I do think they have to be [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1098.24s)]
*  controlled. And I think Epic is doing the ecosystem a favor. For example, on this 30% [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1102.08s)]
*  rake that you're talking about, JCal, that level of rake might have been appropriate for certain [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1107.28s)]
*  types of apps, like a hobbyist app where it's literally 100% margin. Okay, you pay 30% to the [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1112.8799999999999s)]
*  app store. It doesn't work for SaaS companies. I mean, I can tell you that. I mean, this would [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1118.72s)]
*  be like half of their gross margin or something like that. It doesn't work for a lot of companies [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1122.56s)]
*  that spend a lot of money on content creation like Epic, which spends a lot of money in R&D to [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1129.04s)]
*  create a game like Fortnite. Netflix, Spotify, they're gonna break their models immediately. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1133.12s)]
*  Or Amazon with Kindle. And so what happened is it used to be the case that Amazon could have a link [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1137.28s)]
*  in their app, at least directing the user to go to the amazon.com website and you could buy the book [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1144.24s)]
*  there and you could circumvent the rake in the app and it was inconvenient for the user, but at least [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1149.28s)]
*  there was a way around it. Then Apple banned those links. Then they banned the ability for [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1154.48s)]
*  the app to even message to the user what was happening. So if, for example, if you use the [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1160.24s)]
*  Kindle app on iOS, which I do all the time, you can't buy a book in it. And the reason why is [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1164.88s)]
*  because Amazon doesn't want to pay the 30% rake, but they can't even tell you that. It just looks [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1172.08s)]
*  like it's broken functionality. So those of us who know, go to amazon.com through the browser and we [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1176.24s)]
*  buy the book there and then it magically appears in the Kindle app. We've all had that experience. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1181.2s)]
*  So I just think that these duopolies have to be controlled. I think that it would be good if the [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1186.0s)]
*  government could figure out better ways to do it. I don't think M&A is the right way to do it. We've [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1190.88s)]
*  talked about this before. I think that restricting anti-competitive tactics is really the way to stop [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1195.52s)]
*  it. And like I said, I can't speak to the details of Epic's case, but I do think they're doing the [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1200.96s)]
*  ecosystem a favor here by pushing back on these monopolies and helping to keep them under control. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1206.16s)]
*  Aaron Norris I 100% agree with you, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1211.52s)]
*  Sachs, and your take. And I think actually other people should join them and the industry should [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1213.44s)]
*  really force this issue because you are absolutely correct that they're boiling the frog. Now they [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1217.6000000000001s)]
*  did make some cuts under a million. I think they charged 15% on the first million. So they try to [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1221.76s)]
*  be nice to the smaller developers. Sachs No, pull it up. That's not, look, it's actually the larger [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1226.16s)]
*  ones too. Pull up the link I just said. So you'll see here Google charges through the Play Store. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1229.68s)]
*  If you want to have distribution, I mean, think about the Play Store as being like a retailer. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1236.16s)]
*  You make clothing, you need to have a retail store that someone can go to and buy stuff. The [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1239.6s)]
*  retail store has to make money. You're not going to have a retail store that's free. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1243.2s)]
*  So how does the retail store make money? Well, they charge 98% of apps, as you can see here are [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1246.96s)]
*  free because they don't make any money on that. But then if you start to charge subscriptions, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1251.52s)]
*  it's 15% take on automatically renewing subscriptions where it's easier. Yeah, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1255.68s)]
*  yeah, it's easier. No, each year, look at the second. No, no, no, no, it's for renewing. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1261.8400000000001s)]
*  So I know this because of calm. So in the first year, it's for renewing subscriptions, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1265.76s)]
*  subscription products. So all subscriptions that have an automatic renewal feature to them [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1271.2s)]
*  are instantly at 15%. And as a result, you know, you can think about the what is it worth to get [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1275.76s)]
*  a user to not have to enter their credit card info, you know, plus the credit card fees, it's [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1281.04s)]
*  like 15% is not too crazy. Honestly, I'm just, you know, I'm not trying to be a super Google advocate, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1284.64s)]
*  but I'm just saying like, I don't think that's too crazy. And then they've got this like negotiated [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1290.08s)]
*  tier, where if you are a very large app developer, and you want to go and negotiate with Google, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1293.6s)]
*  they have a biz dev team like Spotify and others get where they'll negotiate fees down. And you can [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1297.76s)]
*  actually go and like argue for better economics. So they've tried to be commercial, which I'm [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1302.48s)]
*  guessing is probably why Lena con and others haven't gone after them for antitrust and [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1306.6399999999999s)]
*  monopolistic behavior, because they've tried to find the comfortable place where it's not going [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1311.4399999999998s)]
*  to be too crazy. At least that's my read on what's gone on because otherwise, I mean, obviously, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1315.52s)]
*  folks would be all over them. You know, if it really was monopolistic, the boiling of the frog [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1319.52s)]
*  issue is the one for me, because then they want to charge you now for placement in the app store, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1322.8799999999999s)]
*  and get revenue from you there. Oh, yeah, I mean, that's Amazon, too. Amazon's got that, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1327.6s)]
*  like everyone's gotten squeaky. Every DTC company in the last five years has gotten obliterated, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1331.76s)]
*  their unit economics are upside down now. And we've talked about this, both Google's taken out [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1336.24s)]
*  the margin, but Amazon forces you to buy ads in order to get product placement. Yeah. And then [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1340.0s)]
*  they force you to pay all the extra fees for inventory. Amazon squeezed everyone way more [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1344.48s)]
*  than any of these digital app stores. This is the perfect place for Luna con to get active, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1349.04s)]
*  I think, and the settlement super easy. The entire industry should come at them. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1353.04s)]
*  In unison, tons of lawsuits, group lawsuits, until they allow when you turn on your Apple phone, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1358.24s)]
*  the ability to load Amazon's app store, epic app store, whoever else wants to have an app store, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1363.84s)]
*  that should be your right. If you buy a hardware device, it should be your right to load these and [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1369.36s)]
*  they shouldn't be angled in any way. And that's the other thing Android does all kinds of anchoring [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1372.8799999999999s)]
*  to make those with those pop ups and hey, this isn't safe, etc. They should have a verified app [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1377.76s)]
*  store program. Amazon's app store, epic app store, they should be verified or something. And maybe [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1382.16s)]
*  they pay 5% to have a verified app store. But this is a this is going to be an ongoing issue. And [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1387.28s)]
*  we'll see more of it, I think. So let's go on. Anybody else have thoughts on it? No. Okay. So in [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1394.96s)]
*  other news, OpenAI is started to cut licensing deals. If you remember, we had a big debate about [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1402.24s)]
*  this back on Episode 115 in February. And I was saying, Hey, this content is owned and the [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1408.0s)]
*  opportunity to create LLMs or derivative products, you know, is the right of the people who make that [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1416.4s)]
*  content. Saks, you told me I was gonna get rolled over. But here we are. I wouldn't say I said you're [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1421.68s)]
*  going to get rolled over. What I said is the ecosystem is going to figure this out. Okay, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1426.72s)]
*  let's play the tape. If chat GPT takes a Yelp review, and a you know, a content as traveler [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1430.24s)]
*  review, and they represent it based on the best content that's out there that they've already [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1437.28s)]
*  ranked because they have that algorithm with PageRank or Bing's ranking engine, and then they [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1442.48s)]
*  republish it. And then that jeopardizes those businesses that is profoundly unfair and not what [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1446.32s)]
*  we want for society. And they are interfering with their ability to leverage their own content is [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1451.1200000000001s)]
*  profoundly unfair. And those magazines and newspapers need to What's that? You're gonna [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1456.48s)]
*  get steamrolled. Okay, there it is. Man, is my hair worse now? Or then? Yeah, that was cut back [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1461.76s)]
*  then. I think you were like post COVID back then. Yeah, much better right now. Like a to pay. Nick, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1469.3600000000001s)]
*  can you can you just show us a picture of that? It looks like a common era. That was like a like [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1475.84s)]
*  an early ad. This is like the common area now. You know, that's a to pay. That's a to pay. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1481.04s)]

*  in between phase with our hair. It's part of the process. Now I know why we're talking about this [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1502.1599999999999s)]
*  topic. Because you think you it's it's a total non story or it's I shouldn't say it's a non [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1506.08s)]

*  opening I announced a licensing deal with Axel Springer to bring real time news from Politico [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1514.48s)]
*  and the fake news from Business Insider to chat b2t. You literally sound like Alex Jones. I mean, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1519.68s)]
*  thank you. Thank you. I got one thing right. As part of the deal, Axel Springer can use chat [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1527.2s)]
*  GPT to improve their products includes other European sites. This is on top of the deal that [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1537.2s)]
*  opening I did with the Associated Press. But most importantly, let me just most importantly, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1542.64s)]
*  I'm going to throw it in a second. Most importantly, when chat GPT relies on these sources, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1546.88s)]
*  it'll include a summary and a link back. Other examples of licensing are happening all over the [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1550.96s)]
*  industry. Adobe is using stop images for theirs and stable diffusion, as you know, that brazenly [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1556.16s)]
*  used Getty's images are being sued. So Freeberg, you thought this was unrealistic, but here we are. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1562.3200000000002s)]
*  No, I don't agree with your framing. And I think that I think it's unrealistic for you to frame this [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1569.1200000000001s)]
*  as validating or justifying the fact that these companies won't be able to access and utilize open [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1574.4s)]
*  data under fair use to train models. So that's what's going on historically, right? So the open [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1580.96s)]
*  web, you know, we talked a little bit about where folks can get content from the open web, you can [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1586.64s)]
*  browse the internet, you can download all this content, it's all freely available, it's readily [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1591.36s)]
*  available, it's in it's in the open domain. And then you can train models, and then the models [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1595.1999999999998s)]
*  can ultimately make stuff based on all that training data. What this deal is, is it's actually a [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1599.76s)]
*  content integration deal. And I'll read this with the partnership chat GPT users around the world [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1605.12s)]
*  will receive summaries of selected global news content from Axel Springer's media brands, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1610.8s)]
*  including yada yada, including otherwise paid content. So what chat GPT is doing is they're [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1615.6799999999998s)]
*  accessing content behind a paywall. And they're being able and instead of training models on it, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1620.4s)]
*  they're able to fetch that data as a retrieval aspect of the chat GPT service. So now you as [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1625.52s)]
*  a user want an update on, hey, what's going on with Donald Trump, it can search not it can not [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1631.3600000000001s)]
*  just use its training data, but it can recognize that, hey, there's a current event news question [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1636.16s)]
*  embedded in this query. And I can go fetch that current event news answer from this content that [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1641.44s)]
*  I've now paid for. So it's not a training data set that's that's now being unlocked, which is [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1647.04s)]
*  what the complaint was before that all the open web data was being used for training. But it's [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1651.28s)]
*  behind paywall data that can now be fetched and integrated. And I think it's more interesting [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1655.44s)]
*  because it really speaks to a new model for how the internet will work, which we've talked about, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1659.52s)]
*  which is that there may be these sort of new chat interfaces that cannot just send you to another [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1664.48s)]
*  page and link you over somewhere, but can fetch data for you and present it to you in an integrated [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1669.36s)]
*  way in the response it's providing. And these services have to pay for access to that. So chat, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1674.24s)]
*  you know, open AI, it's a three year deal, they're paying tens of millions of dollars to Axel Springer [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1678.72s)]
*  to access their closed content and present it to the user. So I think it's quite a bit different [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1683.28s)]
*  than, you know, using training data, which is what you know, the complaint was the first time around. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1687.28s)]
*  And it's more of like a really interesting front end feature for what chat GPT is becoming. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1691.44s)]
*  Sacks, you wanted to add to that? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1696.32s)]
*  And I don't really have a lot to add to that. I think Fiber did a great job explaining [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1699.36s)]
*  that issue. I mean, look, I think J. Cal, you've had a little bit of an obsession with this copyright [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1703.2s)]
*  issue. Protecting rights holders, I do believe in. I don't know if it's obsession. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1707.12s)]
*  Fiber makes a really great point, which is there's a difference between copying somebody's [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1712.3999999999999s)]
*  copywritten work, which would be a violation of copyright, and using content that's available on [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1717.6799999999998s)]
*  the open web to train a model to create entirely new content. And I do think that AI models should [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1723.6799999999998s)]
*  be able to use the content that's available on the web under a fair use doctrine to train their [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1732.0s)]
*  models for the benefit of consumers. And I don't see a reason to try and tie that up in a bunch of [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1738.4s)]
*  copyright lawsuits. If chat GPT is producing a plagiarized result, then you may have grounds [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1744.8s)]
*  for a copyright infringement claim. So what I would say is, you know, when you look at [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1750.24s)]
*  that fair use doctrine, I've got a lot of experience with it, having done this in blogs [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1754.48s)]
*  and other content companies. You know, the fourth factor test, I'm sure you're well aware of this, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1758.48s)]
*  is the effect of the use on the potential market and the value of the work. And if you look at [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1762.8s)]
*  the lawsuits that are starting to emerge, it is Getty's right to then make derivative products [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1768.24s)]
*  based on their images, I think we would all agree. Stable diffusion, when they use these open web, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1774.4s)]
*  that is no excuse to use an open web crawler to avoid getting a license from the original [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1779.6s)]
*  owner of that just because you can technically do it doesn't mean you're allowed to do it. In fact, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1785.28s)]
*  the open web projects that provide these say explicitly, we do not give you the right to use [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1788.8s)]
*  this. You have to then go read the copyright laws on each of those websites. And on top of that, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1794.72s)]
*  if somebody were to steal the copyrights of other people put it on the open web, which is happening [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1800.8s)]
*  all day long, you still if you're building a derivative work like this, you still need to go [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1805.6s)]
*  get it. So it's no excuse that I took some site in Russia that did a bunch of copyright violation, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1810.4s)]
*  and then I index them for my training model. So I think this is going to result. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1815.8400000000001s)]
*  Hey, can you shoot me in the face and let me know when this segment is over? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1820.16s)]
*  Okay. All right. So the segment is now over. I was about to throw it to you. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1824.24s)]
*  Code war. I mean, like, stop with this navel gazing nonsense. We're in inning one, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1830.0s)]
*  and nobody knows anything. And the most important thing is that this will get sorted out through [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1836.0800000000002s)]
*  trials. That's where you are right, Jason, it's going to go to court. And this, and I think we [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1844.0800000000002s)]
*  should just not opine on this stuff, because it's esoteric at best. And it's kind of like, whatever. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1848.24s)]
*  Well, some of it will go to court, other ones will be done in the free market, like we see here. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1854.0s)]
*  Another thing I care about this more than most people because you're a journalist, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1858.48s)]
*  and you think that's going to put people out of work. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1861.6000000000001s)]
*  I am a content creator. I'm also an author, as you know, and a podcaster, and I create all kinds [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1863.28s)]
*  of content. I do think that you should get permission before you leverage people's work [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1867.68s)]
*  to create different derivative products. Correct. And actually, you're starting to see this in [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1871.36s)]
*  Dolly in chat. GPT seems to be getting ahead of this because of all the incoming lawsuits. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1876.08s)]
*  Check this out. I started asking Dolly to make me Star Wars characters of Bulldogs. And they said, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1881.36s)]
*  make a Jedi Bulldog. It did that. No problem. Then I asked it to make a version of this using [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1886.72s)]
*  and make a Darth Vader. And it said, I'm unable to generate images based on your request due to our [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1892.72s)]
*  content policy. If you have other ideas and concepts you'd like to blow up, feel free to share. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1898.16s)]
*  So I said, make me a Sithboard cat. And it basically made me Darth Vader. And so it's very [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1902.56s)]
*  clear that the team over at OpenAI is now taking- You're prompt engineering. You're like a clever [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1907.2s)]
*  prompt engineer then. Well, yeah, I got a round copyright here, right? And so it's very clear- [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1913.2s)]
*  It's very clear. This shows how silly all of this stuff is. This is just a drag coefficient on [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1916.64s)]
*  development of AI and on users because now you've got to word your prompt exactly the right way. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1922.3200000000002s)]
*  Well, I think what they're doing is they know that Marvel and all the Disney characters, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1928.0s)]
*  all the Star Wars characters, they're very protective of their IP. Disney is going to launch [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1932.16s)]
*  their own Dolly-type stable diffusion product where you can do this. Put yourself on a Star Wars [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1936.16s)]
*  character. Disney's not going to be any good at this. It doesn't matter if they're good or not. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1940.72s)]
*  It's their IP. And so- I mean, look, fans can create their own artwork that's in the vein of [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1944.16s)]
*  like a Darth Vader image. Yes. They can, but they can't do it commercially. And what ChatGPT and [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1948.88s)]
*  OpenAI here is commercial because I pay $20 a month to ChatGPT. So that's what you're missing. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1954.0s)]
*  A fan, of course, can make a Jedi cat or whatever. All right. Well, all I know is you played this [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1958.3200000000002s)]
*  way back video from episode 15 or something. Wow, it was February. No, no, no. It was still in the [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1962.88s)]
*  hundreds. But whatever. From episode 115 as if you had a dunk on me. Hey, listen, I know you guys [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1967.6000000000001s)]
*  never want to think I'm right. And then it turns out that Freeberg totally blew up your case. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1971.44s)]
*  He didn't blow up my case. I will be right and continue to be right. Okay. Now let's go to [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1975.44s)]
*  something we can all agree. We're definitely not striking this segment. I liked it. Let's go. No, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1979.3600000000001s)]
*  no, no, no. It's spicy. We like a little spicy here. I didn't even have to refute you. Freeberg [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1982.48s)]
*  just did it. It was beautiful. Well, I mean, listen, okay. You came in, you thought you had the goods. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1986.4s)]
*  Admit it. No. He's like playing this way back video from like 45 episodes ago. I finally got him. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1990.3200000000002s)]
*  I finally got Saks. I was finally right about something. If you hadn't claimed you never used [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=1997.04s)]
*  the right steam roll, I would have never played the clip. Oh my God. I have some live footage. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2001.04s)]
*  I just want to go through it and just talk about it. I strike it. I strike it. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2005.04s)]
*  Anyways. Yeah. So guys, there's this copyright thing I want to. Okay. Hold on. Let me, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2009.44s)]
*  let me just reframe. Let me just start that again. Okay. You know, copyright issues. Okay. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2013.76s)]
*  Wait, hold on a second. Well, listen, there's this thing I want to talk about copyright, which [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2018.32s)]
*  is, oh, these are always a super popular. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2023.44s)]
*  When you do a deal for something and you want to get, okay, hold on. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2030.64s)]
*  Everybody that writes gets a chance. Okay. Hold on. I mean, if I could get up that high, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2037.3600000000001s)]
*  I would miss the dunk and still be happy about it. He's about to steam roll. Okay. Thank you. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2041.04s)]
*  I strike it. Let's keep going. You can't strike everything. Come on. J Cal, you teed up the way [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2047.2s)]
*  back clip of yourself. You teed up the way back clip of yourself. So you brought this on yourself. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2054.08s)]
*  I knew you were going to deny it and I just waited for you to deny it. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2059.36s)]
*  Yeah, but you tried to dunk and it didn't work. Okay. Okay. Okay. Every bit has to take the piss [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2063.12s)]
*  out of me. I don't know. I'm seeing a trend. No, that was actually a no. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2067.76s)]
*  No, don't bring up the way back clips unless you have a clean dunk. All right. Here we go. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2071.52s)]
*  Don't bring it to the hoop and then break it. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2076.64s)]
*  Break it. Break it. He had a receipt. It turned out the credit card was stolen. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2079.92s)]
*  Who actually deserves credit for admitting that he was wrong. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2092.4s)]
*  Oh, we'll get to it. We'll get to it. Okay. Hold on. Red meat's coming. Here we go. Red meat's coming. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2095.92s)]
*  Great transition. Great transition. Here we go. Elon versus the FCC. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2101.52s)]
*  Another government agency is now targeting Elon. This is a little bit complicated. But [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2106.08s)]
*  let me explain on Tuesday, the FCC rejected Starlink's application for 900 million in subsidies [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2111.2s)]
*  for rural broadband. Starlink originally won these back in 2020, when they agreed to provide [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2117.2s)]
*  high speed internet to 640,000 rural homes across 35 states funding would have come [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2123.44s)]
*  from the RDF, rural digital opportunity fund, I guess the government is paying for [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2128.96s)]
*  expanding broadband services in rural areas. And Starlink obviously is perfect for that. It's [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2135.12s)]
*  actually the only solution for this really. She can't run fiber to these locations. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2139.9199999999996s)]
*  So the FCC found that Starlink quote had failed to meet its burden to be entitled to those funds. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2144.4799999999996s)]
*  And here's the quote. FCC has a responsibility to be a good steward of limited public funds [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2151.68s)]
*  meant to expand access to rural broadband, not fund applicants that failed to meet basic program [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2157.12s)]
*  requirements. Brendan Carr, one of the FCC's commissioners, dissented from the agency's [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2163.28s)]
*  decision. And he did not hold back. Last year, so the quote after Elon acquired Twitter, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2168.8s)]
*  President Biden gave federal agencies a green light to go after him. Today's decision certainly [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2174.0800000000004s)]
*  fits the Biden administration's pattern of regulatory harassment. This is a decision that [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2178.2400000000002s)]
*  cannot be explained by any objective application of law, facts or policy. Car went on to explain [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2183.76s)]
*  how his decision was made and why it's unprecedented instead of applying the traditional [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2190.0s)]
*  FCC standards to the record evidence, which would have compelled the agency to confirm Starlink's [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2193.6s)]
*  $885 million award. The FCC denied it on the grounds that Starlink is not providing high speed [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2199.3599999999997s)]
*  internet service to all these locations today. As noted, the FCC's milestone does not kick in [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2205.2s)]
*  until 2025. Let me toss to you, Sachs, thoughts on the Biden hit squad going after E. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2210.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, I can't remember anything quite like this. This is absolutely extraordinary. I mean, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2216.96s)]
*  you have a sitting member of the FCC telling us that the FCC is engaging in political retaliation. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2221.84s)]
*  He sits on the board of the five commissioners of the FCC. They just canceled an $885 million [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2228.2400000000002s)]
*  contract to Starlink. What was that contract for? To provide rural internet service. Starlink is [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2233.36s)]
*  the only company that has that capability today. It's the only one that has that capability, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2238.88s)]
*  if you look forward a few years. It is by far the best at providing broadband from space, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2243.6s)]
*  which is the best way to get into these rural areas. What did the commission do? Well, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2248.08s)]
*  they cherry picked, they took speed test snapshots from two cherry pick moments in time. Even that [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2253.2s)]
*  probably was not an accurate reflection of where Starlink is today. But they then said, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2260.16s)]
*  based on those snapshots, that Starlink would not be able to meet the standards in three years. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2264.64s)]
*  So remember, the requirements that they're saying that Starlink violated don't even have to be met [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2269.84s)]
*  for three years. So somehow they're saying that Starlink will not get there in three years. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2275.76s)]
*  They're preemptively judging the service to meet a standard that is not even required to meet today. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2279.76s)]
*  Nobody else is even close to meeting the standard. So Elon's response to this was, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2286.32s)]
*  guys, okay, if you're going to cancel the contract for us, just save the money because [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2291.28s)]
*  the competitors that you're giving it to have even less of a service than we do. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2296.56s)]
*  So just save the taxpayer the money, but they're not doing that. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2301.68s)]
*  So this is really remarkable. And what Carr said here is that the Biden administration is [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2306.24s)]
*  choosing to prioritize its political and ideological goals at the expense of connecting Americans. We [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2312.48s)]
*  can and should reverse course. This is now part of a pattern of the federal government harassing [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2316.88s)]
*  Elon and his companies. And it all stems from Biden at that press conference saying, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2322.88s)]
*  we got to look at this guy. You know, like Tony Soprano. Yeah, we got to look at this guy, you know, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2327.6s)]
*  I mean, it was like, and so since that's a nice restaurant, you got to be terrible if anything [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2333.92s)]
*  ever happened to it. Yeah, Jake, how you do the impression, I can't do it. Any event. So Biden [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2338.4s)]
*  says in this press conference, we got to look at this guy. And since then, they've investigated [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2343.92s)]
*  Tesla for supposedly building a glass house, which I didn't know was a crime. That's amazing. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2348.08s)]
*  SpaceX, which is partially a defense contractor was sued by the DOJ because they were hiring [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2354.08s)]
*  too many Americans and didn't, they weren't hiring enough refugees into sensitive national security [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2360.3199999999997s)]
*  roles that they would surely be sued for doing if they were the other way. And now they've [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2366.4s)]
*  canceled a contract for SpaceX having the best service in the space, but somehow missing a [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2371.92s)]
*  goal that they're not required to meet for three years. This is harassment. It's transparent. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2378.16s)]
*  Yeah. And the question I have is, do we want to live in a country where the government can engage [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2383.44s)]
*  in this kind of naked political retaliation against its critics? And I have to say, you know, there [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2388.64s)]
*  was a time in America where, you know, Nixon was roundly attacked for having this quote unquote [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2394.72s)]
*  enemies list where supposedly, you know, he had made a list of all his enemies and the IRS was [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2400.8s)]
*  auditing them. Okay. We are so far beyond that point and the media isn't interested at all. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2405.76s)]
*  And no one's really interested unless you like what Elon's doing. But if you don't, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2412.6400000000003s)]
*  you know, if you're on the opposite side of the political spectrum as Elon, you don't care. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2417.2000000000003s)]
*  And there's nobody who's willing to say in a neutral way that political retaliation should [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2421.44s)]
*  not be part of our system. I mean, we have a presidential candidate running specifically saying [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2425.92s)]
*  I am your retribution. I mean, this is something that has to stop across all of politics. Nobody [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2431.44s)]
*  should be using their political power to do any retribution against any buddy. They should be [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2435.84s)]
*  operating the government efficiently and the best interest of all Americans. Okay. So maybe I don't [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2441.04s)]
*  like that rhetoric from Trump. I don't think it's helpful, but what did Trump ever do that's in this [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2446.4s)]
*  league? I mean, everything they accused Trump of doing the fascism, the retribution, all that kind [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2450.96s)]
*  of stuff seems to me the Biden administration is doing here. Yeah. Well, I mean, he says he's going [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2456.64s)]
*  to do it. He says the first thing he's going to do is go after journalists. And do you think Trump [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2460.96s)]
*  did no retribution when he was in office? I mean, we have to look through every single issue. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2464.56s)]
*  It's interesting. I mean, one doesn't come off the top of my head. I'm trying to remember if he ever [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2472.56s)]
*  said, I'm going to go after this person or that person. I don't remember an instance of him saying [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2476.48s)]
*  he said, lock her up. That was in. He never did it. Trump was all talk in this respect. He didn't [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2480.32s)]
*  actually do it. Yes. This is what Peter Thiel said. Like, you know, his great quote about him, like, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2486.16s)]
*  just look at his actions, not at what he says. He say burattles and he says he's going to do [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2490.32s)]
*  retribution against everybody, but you know, then he doesn't. So trauma, even talking about Trump in [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2494.7200000000003s)]
*  this context is a deflection to account. The action is being taken by the Biden administration. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2498.7200000000003s)]
*  They've now weaponized multiple federal agencies to go after Elon on these cases that seem [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2502.6400000000003s)]
*  transparently trumped up a glass house, not hiring enough refugees to national security roles. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2507.92s)]
*  It's obvious what's happening. A contract for the for Starlink, which is by far the best rural [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2513.52s)]
*  internet service. How do you even justify these cases on their? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2517.84s)]
*  I'm not just 100%. I'm in 100% agreement. You think there's this is politically motivated [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2521.76s)]
*  harassment of Elon by the Biden administration? 100% He said it. He said it and he didn't invite [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2528.4s)]
*  him to the EV son. So you just take Biden at his actions. If you don't invite, if you don't invite [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2533.04s)]
*  you on to the EV summit, it's obvious that he's got it in for this guy. And now it's obvious he's [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2538.0s)]
*  told people to, you know, investigate him and harass him. It's obvious. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2543.2s)]
*  So why do you think they don't like him? Why do you think Biden doesn't like [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2547.6s)]
*  Why doesn't Biden like him because he's non union. It's obvious. That's the that's the [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2552.7999999999997s)]
*  beginning and end of it. I mean, I'm sure the freedom of speech things and, you know, Twitter [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2556.0s)]
*  doesn't help. But this predates Biden is a union guy. And he will not have non union people, he [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2560.16s)]
*  will not support non union people. He is bought and sold by the unions. That's 100%. And Elon said [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2566.56s)]
*  that that may be how it started. But I think you're underrating the free speech aspect. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2571.04s)]
*  Oh, I said it could have to do with that. But it's definitely that's the number one issue. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2575.92s)]
*  More importantly, you're saying enabling dissenting voices strongly dissent. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2581.36s)]
*  Absolutely. I think I think that from the get go, they have sought to exercise control over the [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2584.56s)]
*  Twitter formerly Twitter now x platform, because it is the town square for political speech. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2591.52s)]
*  Oh, they succeeded. They succeeded the FBI, everybody control of it until you want somehow [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2597.28s)]
*  bought the company, which was not in their plans. Frankly, that was just a fluke. I mean, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2602.2400000000002s)]
*  that was something that Elon did out of the blue, because he cares a lot about free speech. And he [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2605.84s)]
*  opened up the Twitter jails and, you know, stop the censorship and open up the Twitter files, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2610.4s)]
*  we found out that this was not just a private company acting on its own. It was being directed [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2615.6000000000004s)]
*  or encouraged by giving them a list of tweets. They were giving them a list of tweets saying, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2622.8s)]
*  hey, these tweets probably violate your terms of service. Yeah, you know, and the FBI acting as [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2627.76s)]
*  the quote unquote belly button of the whole federal government directing all these take down [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2633.1200000000003s)]
*  requests totally on American. I think that the pattern of actions more than anything, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2636.7200000000003s)]
*  mandates that Biden and his team actually have to address publicly why it is not retribution. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2641.84s)]
*  The absence of doing that at this point is going to be more damaging to them than just letting [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2648.72s)]
*  things go on and claiming down the road, hey, this is all part of the normal course of business. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2654.8799999999997s)]
*  Now, the guy does- Why would they address it? Why do they have to address it? The media doesn't [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2659.52s)]
*  hold them accountable. The media doesn't report it. The media pretended like the Twitter files [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2664.0s)]
*  never even happened. Remember that? Zero mainstream media coverage of the Twitter files. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2666.7999999999997s)]
*  Zero mainstream media coverage of these retaliatory lawsuits. Why would the Biden [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2672.56s)]
*  administration need to explain itself? Why would they even talk about it? The fix is in. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2676.56s)]
*  Well, I mean, now the question is being, I think- [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2680.56s)]
*  The mainstream media are stenographers for one side of the political spectrum, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2682.48s)]
*  which is precisely the reason why- Did you guys see this thing? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2686.88s)]
*  Hold on. It's precisely the reason why they're so upset with Elon with opening up [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2689.52s)]
*  free speech on Twitter because they had total control of the public discourse until he did that. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2693.84s)]
*  Did you see that thing this morning where somebody called out the New York Times for [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2699.12s)]
*  selectively editing what Hunter Biden said to make it more- [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2703.7599999999998s)]
*  Broad. Broad? Did you see that, Jason? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2707.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. He basically said, my father has not financially been involved in my businesses. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2710.64s)]
*  And the New York Times took out the word financially to make it more broad to say he's [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2716.0s)]
*  not been involved in my business. He obviously was involved in his businesses. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2719.84s)]
*  They did? Really? Yeah. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2722.48s)]
*  And there's a clip where they show the article and then they show his interview. And the interview [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2724.08s)]
*  is very clear. He says it, but the New York Times headline omits the word and doesn't put [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2730.16s)]
*  it in a bracket so that it shows that it was edited. It shows that that was the quote. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2735.3599999999997s)]
*  Can you pull it out? Do you have that thing? It's so crazy. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2739.04s)]
*  And let me find it. That's crazy. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2742.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, I would like to think there's a possibility this was a mistake, but man, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2744.8799999999997s)]
*  it's pretty bad. I mean, this is really bad by the New York Times. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2748.16s)]
*  And they got to figure out who actually took that word out because it's pretty clear Biden [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2751.92s)]
*  was very involved in Hunter's businesses. And that's why he put that word financially in there [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2756.48s)]
*  because he was on I think he's on all the documents as being part of it. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2763.76s)]
*  And he's in the emails. And so he was the branch at Cal. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2767.36s)]
*  Ah, there it is. Thank you, Nick. You're very good at finding these things there. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2771.28s)]
*  Okay. So if you look on the left, that's the article in the New York Times. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2774.48s)]
*  And it's clear that that was the quote. And then if you play it on the right, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2780.0s)]
*  it's actually what he said. Let me state as clearly as I can. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2783.28s)]
*  My father was not financially involved in my business. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2788.1600000000003s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. And then the quote says, let me stay as clear as I can. My father was not [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2791.44s)]
*  involved in my business. Now, if in journalism, you could put an ellipsis after involved, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2796.5600000000004s)]
*  you know, three dots in, but why would you do that? This is like breaking very basic [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2803.52s)]
*  journalistic standards. So my point, there's like a format, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2808.0s)]
*  right? When you edit out a word like that. Yeah, you would only put it out a word if it was [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2810.56s)]
*  superfluous. And you wanted to have a tighter quote. You have the person said, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2814.7999999999997s)]
*  Hmm, ah, you can take that out. And if you were taking out a long quote, you put three dots, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2818.64s)]
*  and then you would show that you cut the quote, there was something in between. And then you went [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2823.2s)]
*  to that. That is something this important, you would never take out a keyword like that. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2826.96s)]
*  That this is just journalism 101. So I mean, if this happens, man, it is, it's the key word in [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2832.48s)]
*  the sentence, by the way, it's the key word in the sentence. It is the key word in the sentence. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2839.2s)]
*  So if the person took it out, man, who took it out? And this is the problem with the New York Times, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2842.96s)]
*  is they bury their corrections. They need to, and this is back to accountability, you're saying [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2848.3199999999997s)]
*  Freeburg, the Biden administration has to explain why they excluded Elon from the EV summits. And [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2853.3599999999997s)]
*  the New York Times needs to explain why they did this or else, you know, the mind wanders that [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2858.0s)]
*  there's some conspiracy going on here or targeting. And I wonder if they changed it. Well, here's the [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2863.12s)]
*  live story. Has it changed in the story? Did they change it yet? Luke Broadwater? I mean, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2867.6s)]
*  Luke Broadwater, is that a name from central casting? That's not a real name, is it? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2872.4s)]
*  It looks like they posted a correction. Oh, here we go. Correction. An earlier version of [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2876.64s)]
*  this article misquoted Hunter by, and you said my father was not financial. It was not my father. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2879.8399999999997s)]
*  So the only room I have here is if the person was live transcribing it, maybe, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2884.16s)]
*  and they left it out. But this is too important to not have a fact checker go through it. And to [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2889.44s)]
*  have to get called out on it to fix it, it just shows how far the New York Times has swung. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2893.6s)]
*  This is me, Kulwant, though, J. Cala, putting on the front page. I did not kill that person. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2897.6s)]
*  And then a day later, it buried in page 812. I actually did kill that person. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2902.64s)]
*  I mean, if you, the correction at the bottom of the story is good. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2908.88s)]
*  Everybody sees the front page. Very, very few people, you would agree with me, very, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2912.0s)]
*  very few people see the correction. In the old days, they would put the correction on like [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2915.6s)]
*  A2, A3 of the paper, and it would be small and be at the bottom. In the digital age, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2919.28s)]
*  you put the correction at the bottom of the article. So it's a little bit better. But the [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2923.92s)]
*  truth is most people don't go to the bottom of the article. So there's an argument to put [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2927.36s)]
*  corrections at the top of the article. But journalists don't want to admit when they're wrong. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2931.36s)]
*  I think I saw a list of all of the organizations investigating Elon. And what was surprising was [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2935.76s)]
*  how broad some of these organizations felt that they had a mandate to look into him. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2943.52s)]
*  So there was like, I want to say, Nick, maybe you can find this on Twitter, but they had a [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2950.56s)]
*  list of them. And it was like, the Bureau of Land Management investigation. I mean, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2954.24s)]
*  it just makes no sense. Like, it just does not smell right. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2959.92s)]
*  In fairness, Elon is involved in many, many very important projects. So there would be a lot of [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2964.48s)]
*  agencies that speaks to over regulation. And then you have to drill down and say, okay, when are they [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2970.24s)]
*  actually targeting him? And so that's going to be a lot of parsing. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2975.04s)]
*  Fish and wildlife, you know, health and human housing. I mean, it's a list goes on. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2977.3599999999997s)]
*  You might as well just say the entire- [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2982.08s)]
*  He was fishing some oration? He fished in the wrong pond or what? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2982.56s)]
*  No, I think my understanding of it is, you know, at Starbase, there's some estuaries or something. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2986.16s)]
*  And there was a lot of- [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2993.6s)]
*  Estuaries. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2995.12s)]
*  I mean, yes, we protect animals and whatever. This is something that happens all over the [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=2996.8s)]
*  country. Where California is actually probably the leader in this. But I think some crabs might [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3001.68s)]
*  have got burned, not in a barbecue, but by the rocket. I mean, literally that. And then this is [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3007.04s)]
*  this, this speaks to what risk are we willing to take to make progress as humanity? [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3013.28s)]
*  Freeberg, remember, we had this discussion about self-driving cars. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3017.36s)]
*  Like, if getting to Mars and being multi-planetary kills some crabs, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3020.88s)]
*  I think we should be okay with that. In fact, if it decimated, I mean, it's not decimated, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3025.44s)]
*  but let's just say 100 square miles got decimated by getting to Mars on planet Earth. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3030.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, you'd make that trade off, right? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3034.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's a, I mean, this is the same standard. I think I feel around if there's a mouse [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3037.52s)]
*  infestation in my house, I'm not going to let the mice live in my house, even though I'm completely [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3042.16s)]
*  ethically against killing animals, killing animals to eat when I have other options, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3047.68s)]
*  I'm against. And I think animal testing and medical applications, I have a totally different [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3053.2s)]
*  standard than I think what is standard in the market today. So for me, it's like a pretty [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3057.8399999999997s)]
*  sensitive topic because my ethics are don't kill animals unless absolutely necessary. And the [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3062.08s)]
*  question is what is necessary? What is the definition of necessary? And so these sorts [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3066.24s)]
*  of points that you're making about, you know, if it gets all humans to Mars, that might be a trade [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3069.9199999999996s)]
*  off worth making for some crabs. I don't, you know, it's like, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3075.04s)]
*  Probably hard to understand the analogy here. Are you saying that Elon's the mouse? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3078.16s)]
*  The rocket may have killed the mouse. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3083.92s)]
*  The regulators own the house. Wait, what's the, who's the mouse and who's the house? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3085.36s)]
*  The house is the rocket ship. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3089.68s)]
*  Clearly the mouse is the mouse in the house, right? [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3091.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3094.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3094.56s)]
*  Let's pull up this quote from Brendan Carr is the FCC commissioner. I thought this is amazing. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3095.2799999999997s)]
*  This list is incredible. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3099.2799999999997s)]
*  This is the FCC commissioner. He said, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3101.52s)]
*  He said the DOJ, FAA, FTC, NLRB, SDNY, and FWS, and I guess that's Fish and Wildlife, have all taken [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3103.52s)]
*  action. The FCC now joins them. Man. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3110.2400000000002s)]
*  That's incredible. Yeah. It's a little bit nuts. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3112.6400000000003s)]
*  Look at that Biden quote where I didn't actually know about the second part. I knew about the first [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3115.1200000000003s)]
*  part where he says, we got to take a look at this guy. But then he was asked how this guy, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3119.28s)]
*  President Biden responded. There's a lot of ways. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3124.6400000000003s)]
*  There's a lot of ways. There's a lot of ways to get to somebody. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3126.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's like 20 seconds. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3130.0800000000004s)]
*  You might be able to get to me. I might be able to get to you and you know, maybe you watch it back. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3130.96s)]
*  You know what else Biden said? There's a lot of ways is when he was talking about the, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3140.08s)]
*  the Nord Stream pipeline. And he said that pipeline is not going to move forward. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3145.6s)]
*  And then they said, yeah, but the press reset him. Yeah, but that's, that's like a German [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3151.52s)]
*  Russian project. Like how, what's your involvement? He said we got ways. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3155.52s)]
*  There are a lot of ways we got ways. Wow. Ouch. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3160.64s)]
*  Okay. So on the counterpoint, obviously Elon has several pretty sprawling businesses. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3164.16s)]
*  He has self-driving cars. Right. And they push, right. They push the envelope on, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3169.04s)]
*  you know, where there's an existing regulatory framework, same with going to Mars, right? Same [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3174.24s)]
*  with transmitting internet services, wireless communications. Like, you know, there is a [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3178.4s)]
*  regulatory framework for all of these businesses and he's on the bleeding edge and typically [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3182.4s)]
*  beyond the framework to some degree. So I think it's like worth acknowledging at least that there's [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3186.4s)]
*  an, a necessity of scrutiny and involvement in these agencies, given that they do have [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3191.44s)]
*  regulatory authority and responsibility over these various businesses. And he's well beyond [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3196.08s)]
*  where anyone else is in each of them. So I just want to acknowledge that. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3200.88s)]
*  Hold on. Let me respond to that. Yeah. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3203.84s)]
*  He's well beyond where other people are in his industry in terms of innovation. He's the first [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3206.2400000000002s)]
*  to acknowledge, because I've heard him say this many times, that he's in highly regulated industries [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3210.48s)]
*  and they've got, you know, massive compliance programs at Tesla and SpaceX and all these [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3214.96s)]
*  different companies. What we're judging these regulatory agencies on is not that there's a need [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3220.2400000000002s)]
*  to regulate Elon's companies within the framework of their industries, but rather the specific [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3226.96s)]
*  actions that are being brought. Remember DOJ suing SpaceX for not hiring enough refugees, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3234.4s)]
*  right? Tesla being sued on this glass house business, whatever that is. And now [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3240.96s)]
*  SEC canceling a contract. Yeah. Three years. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3247.12s)]
*  The actions speak volumes. The actions speak volumes. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3251.04s)]
*  Exactly. Three years before the, they even need to judge that contract, whether that contract's been [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3252.4s)]
*  met. 100% right. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3257.68s)]
*  The other thing that happened this week, which I think is important along this vein is that the [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3258.64s)]
*  IRS is in charge of making sure that you can claim the $7,500 EV tax credit for cars. And a lot of [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3262.72s)]
*  us that have been looking at this issue, the way that they break the EV tax credit is in half. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3270.3199999999997s)]
*  And part of it is about where the material is sourced. And part of it has to do with the total [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3275.68s)]
*  sum of certain components of the car and how much of those are made in the U S et cetera. Okay. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3280.8799999999997s)]
*  And it was presumed just based on the trend that Tesla would lose half the credit, keep half the [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3286.96s)]
*  credit. And in a bit of a surprising move, they, the IRS came out and said the whole thing we're [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3293.8399999999997s)]
*  not going to acknowledge anymore. So Tesla had to go and put on the website that the credit ends [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3300.48s)]
*  as of December 31st. So I would add the IRS to this, to this list as well. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3305.92s)]
*  That's so crazy. So I got to be investigated. I like [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3311.44s)]
*  Freberg's suggestion that prove to us that you're not doing this at this point, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3313.68s)]
*  because it's pretty clear that it is happening. And it's just happy to do that. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3319.8399999999997s)]
*  Just on the, on that EV subsidy, you know, one of the perverse things about this is that the [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3325.9199999999996s)]
*  administration is putting the thumb on the scales against Elon in favor of these less innovative [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3332.56s)]
*  competitors who have worse products. So like Elon said, if you want to cancel our contract for [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3339.12s)]
*  Starlink to provide this rural broadband, that's fine to save taxpayers the money, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3345.52s)]
*  but by all means, don't then give them money to these other services that can't deliver. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3350.16s)]
*  What's the point of that? And same thing on the electric cars. I mean, the subsidy is going to [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3353.8399999999997s)]
*  these other car companies that make worse products. Yeah, totally. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3358.16s)]
*  This is the key point. The, the fact is all of those people who just had their Starlink [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3361.3599999999997s)]
*  canceled through the government, I guarantee you, they will buy Starlink because it's the best [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3365.84s)]
*  product. So irony of ironies, they're just going to go spend 60, 70, 80 bucks a month to put their [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3371.76s)]
*  own Starlinks in like everybody else around the world who lives rurally. I have Starlink. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3377.04s)]
*  One more thing to add, they under pressure from regulators, they announced a recall on [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3381.6800000000003s)]
*  Tuesday of 2 million cars to fix some of the autopilot software. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3387.28s)]
*  Yeah, but that's an over the air update. So the press went crazy about that, right? [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3391.92s)]
*  No, no, no. What I'm saying is if you read the article, that over the air update is specifically [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3395.2s)]
*  because of, again, how it's written, regulatory pressure to change how the software behaves, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3400.72s)]
*  some tuning in some edge cases. My point is that one could guess that there is an attempt here [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3407.3599999999997s)]
*  to kind of do the death by a thousand cuts approach, right? So the drip, drip water torture [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3413.68s)]
*  of just like a thing over here, a thing over here, a thing over here, a thing over here. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3418.7999999999997s)]
*  Eventually companies can get distracted and misfire. And so the question I do think is like, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3422.56s)]
*  does it make us better off if all of these little ticky tacky footfalls are [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3431.6s)]
*  enforced by the government? I think we all know what the answer is. No. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3437.36s)]
*  We have an example that Microsoft got so distracted by their court cases that the [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3441.2s)]
*  company went sideways for a decade. Well, but I mean, I think there was a lot of good [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3445.6s)]
*  basis for that particular anti-trust. That was an anti-trust case and Microsoft clearly had a [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3450.0s)]
*  monopoly. Just on the recall thing. I did see that story at the top of Drudge or whatever last week, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3453.84s)]
*  whereas it said every Tesla has to be recalled. And when I see the word recall, I think that [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3458.72s)]
*  means you got to bring it to the dealership and get like some part swapped out, but that's not [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3465.44s)]
*  what happened. No, well, what's so interesting is they refuse in these articles, I can show you the [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3469.6s)]
*  New York Times version of it. They refuse to write that it's actually an OTA update. Breaking news. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3473.52s)]
*  I don't know if you guys saw this, but a billion five iPhones were just recalled for the 17.2 [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3478.56s)]
*  update. So everybody's going to have to bring their iPhones in. 1.5 billion iPhones recall. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3483.52s)]
*  I got to bring it to the store. Yeah. You got to bring it to the store. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3488.72s)]
*  And then they give you this new journal app. I don't know if you got it in the latest update, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3491.2s)]
*  but Apple made a journaling app so that you can have more equity. Yeah, that's the recall. Yeah. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3495.2s)]
*  It's total recall. All right. Listen, now we keep the red meat going. Sax is cooking with oil. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3499.92s)]
*  Alex Jones, the controversial conspiracy commentator of info wars fame is back on [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3505.04s)]
*  Twitter after Elon did a poll. He got 2 million people to respond asking if he should be reinstated. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3511.36s)]
*  70% said yes. Of course, Jones encouraged his fans to vote in this poll. So I'm not sure how [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3516.56s)]
*  scientific it is for background. Twitter permanently banned Jones in 2018 after accusing him of posting [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3520.96s)]
*  direct threats of violence and hate speech. It already received bans from Apple, Facebook and [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3526.64s)]
*  YouTube is pretty much the number one person to be deplatformed. As you know, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3531.36s)]
*  Jones was ordered to pay $1.5 billion to the families of eight Sandy Hook victims. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3537.92s)]
*  This is across two cases in Texas and Connecticut. And here is Jones in his own words on the Sandy [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3545.2000000000003s)]
*  Hook parents. Sandy Hook, it's got inside job written all over it. Sandy Hook is a synthetic, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3550.7200000000003s)]
*  completely fake with actors. In my view, manufactured I couldn't believe it at first [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3558.88s)]
*  the new town kids. They take them put them in our face. Tell us their names who they were. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3564.7200000000003s)]
*  I heard an ad this morning on the radio Bloomberg paid for locally. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3571.36s)]
*  Going I dropped Billy off and watched him go around the corner. And he never came back all [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3575.2000000000003s)]
*  because of the guns. Won't you just turn your guns in for my son? Why'd you do it to him? [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3581.36s)]
*  Gun owners forgive my language, but that guy. Okay, there it is. We have a that guy, but let [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3587.52s)]
*  me sensor him. Unfortunately, not. But I absolutely cannot stand that. That is just like heart wrenching, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3595.68s)]
*  like evil, awful spewing out of his mouth. And he still, you know, should have a right to speak. But [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3603.04s)]
*  man, that guy, I was never a big crier. Part of it was just my defense mechanism. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3610.4s)]
*  And I remember Sandy Hook, because I had just become a parent. I had, I think, two kids by that [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3617.52s)]
*  point. And I was uncontrollably crying when that happened. And it was the first time I realized how [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3625.28s)]
*  you change as a parent and you just develop this empathy. And then you realize how precious [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3633.04s)]
*  kids lives are. And I've become more and more of a crier as my kids have grown older. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3640.0s)]
*  And I really appreciate that what my kids have done for me. So when I hear him talk like that, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3647.92s)]
*  I guess he has a right to say what he wants, but he is a complete piece of [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3654.16s)]
*  s***. Yeah. Okay. So let's get into this very difficult question. In fact, I don't want to [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3659.44s)]
*  force you to defend, you know, one of those horrible humans. I think we can all agree. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3665.84s)]
*  Well, my position is pretty similar with the other guys said, which is what he said was ODS. However, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3670.24s)]
*  that doesn't necessarily mean he should be censored. We have standards. We have First [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3675.2799999999997s)]
*  Amendment standards around this stuff. I agree with that. So first of all, me back up. I mean, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3678.8799999999997s)]
*  I didn't even really know who Alex Jones was. I mean, I only knew him because of the controversy. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3683.2s)]
*  I've never actually listened to a show. I'm not really interested in what he has to say. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3687.7599999999998s)]
*  I do think that if you're going to play this clip of his mistake going back many years, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3693.52s)]
*  you should supplement it by playing a clip of what he says now. And what he says now is [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3697.9199999999996s)]
*  he's apologized. He's admitted he made a mistake. He basically bought into a conspiracy theory. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3703.28s)]
*  But it wasn't just him saying it. Apparently, he had some people on the show who, I don't know [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3709.36s)]
*  if they were purported experts or what, but they were making a case that the whole Sandy Hook thing [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3713.92s)]
*  was a hoax and it was being done to basically, you know, get people's guns. I mean, look, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3719.0400000000004s)]
*  it's nutty stuff. I'm not defending it in any way, but he explained that he bought into that [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3724.96s)]
*  theory or hoax or whatever. And he thinks it's a terrible mistake and he's apologized for it. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3730.2400000000002s)]
*  And the question is, are you going to have a lifetime ban on somebody [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3736.0800000000004s)]
*  for saying things that were wrong and odious when they have now apologized? And for me, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3741.2000000000003s)]
*  it's not about Alex Jones. It's about censorship. Remember, when this case happened way back in 2018, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3747.28s)]
*  it was really hard to defend keeping this guy on the platform in light of what he had said and done [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3756.0s)]
*  because everyone's reacting very emotionally to it. And it was people like defenders of free speech, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3761.36s)]
*  like Glenn Greenwald, who said that, listen, if you take Alex Jones out now, if you have a permanent [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3766.96s)]
*  ban, it will basically be a slippery slope and it will create a precedent and other people will get [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3772.4s)]
*  banned. And sure enough, just two years later, Twitter was banning people like Jay Bhattacharya, [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3778.4s)]
*  Stanford doctor for saying dissident things about COVID that turned out to be completely correct. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3784.56s)]
*  Marie authored the Great Barrington Declaration, talk about how lockdowns wouldn't work and so on. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3789.92s)]
*  And so even within two years of this decision around Alex Jones, the censorship was totally [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3794.88s)]
*  out of control. And so I think the people who warned us that Alex Jones would become a slippery [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3801.68s)]
*  slope ended up being completely correct. To me, that's the symbolism of the restoration of Alex [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3806.56s)]
*  Jones's account. It's not endorsing what he did. It's not saying that what he said was an [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3811.76s)]
*  odious. I mean, look, again, I have zero interest even listening to the guy. But the point is that [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3818.1600000000003s)]
*  free speech does require us to put up with people who are wrong, people who are even hateful sometimes. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3824.7200000000003s)]
*  And stating misinformation. People who put out misinformation. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3833.1200000000003s)]
*  That's what free speech requires us to do. And if you want a different standard, [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3837.76s)]
*  it's going to become a precedent for a lot of censorship that you don't like. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3842.88s)]
*  I agree with Sachs. The only place where I disagree with Sachs is on Twitter, [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3845.6000000000004s)]
*  not having a right to do this as a private enterprise. I think Twitter had a decision [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3851.44s)]
*  to make on what kind of editorialization they wanted to do with the content on their platform, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3855.28s)]
*  on their product. And they made a choice. I don't think that I think it was the wrong choice [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3859.6800000000003s)]
*  personally. And we've talked about this in the past. I think it's great that Elon's [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3863.68s)]
*  making a different choice and catering to a different audience perhaps with a different [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3869.8399999999997s)]
*  product that has more open speech. But that's not a government free speech mandate. That's a [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3875.2s)]
*  private enterprise mandate. And I do believe in the right to free speech. I think it's a little bit [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3881.8399999999997s)]
*  bit ironic to say that it's inappropriate when someone says something that is misinformation [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3887.2s)]
*  because it's incorrect or unprovable. When we have an entire group of people that believe in [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3894.3199999999997s)]
*  something called religion. And much of religion is based on this concept of faith and belief [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3901.4399999999996s)]
*  without necessarily hard proof or evidence. And we allow religion, religious speech, [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3906.0s)]
*  you know, in many forums without saying, hey, that's misinformation or hey, it's not true or [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3912.96s)]
*  hey, it doesn't meet the standards of X or Y or Z's scientific assessment or understanding. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3917.84s)]
*  And so I think it's just worth acknowledging that this whole concept that someone has to [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3923.76s)]
*  ultimately be the police of the truth and the police of fact and the police of information [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3927.12s)]
*  is going to lead to a bad place. And I'd rather have more free speech with people saying [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3931.36s)]
*  misinformation and saying awful, putrid things than one where a few people get to decide what [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3934.72s)]
*  everyone gets to hear. So as much as I absolutely despise this guy. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3939.52s)]
*  Freiburg, you may be right that Twitter as a private company had the right as our laws currently [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3942.88s)]
*  exist to decide who they were going to suspend and ban from the site. However, once that censorship [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3949.36s)]
*  power was created, it attracted powerful entities from our government who wanted to co-opt and use [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3954.4s)]
*  that power. That's what we saw on the Twitter files with the 80 FBI agents sending takedown requests. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3961.84s)]
*  That's what happens is when you create the censorship power, people will abuse it. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3966.56s)]
*  People abuse it. But more to the point, it's such a tempting power to use by people in authority, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3971.12s)]
*  right? It's like the ring of power. Those tools that Twitter created, it's like they released a [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3980.72s)]
*  pheromone or something that attracted all these powerful shadowy actors from the federal government [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3986.56s)]
*  in the FBI and all these agencies. That is why I think it's just very [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3992.16s)]
*  dangerous for even private companies to create these censorship regimes is that [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=3996.8799999999997s)]
*  they can be co-opted and abused. Being co-opted and abused is the issue. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4000.3999999999996s)]
*  I don't think that the issue is their choice in what kind of content they want to put out. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4005.2799999999997s)]
*  You can go to the Netflix kids version of Netflix and kids, they control what content is on Netflix [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4010.3199999999997s)]
*  and they provide a different version than what they provide to adults. I think editorializing [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4015.68s)]
*  the content platform that you're making available, whether it's user generated [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4019.84s)]
*  or paid for or whatever, is a totally reasonable approach to running a business, a content business. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4023.2000000000003s)]
*  The point you're making is the right one, which is the point at which you allow government agencies [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4029.2000000000003s)]
*  to intervene and have control and manipulation over private citizens, user generated content is [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4034.0s)]
*  where I think it crossed the line. I don't disagree with you on that point. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4039.2000000000003s)]
*  May I ask two clarifying questions here? Because I'm curious how you would handle this. If you [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4043.1200000000003s)]
*  were the CEO of X, formerly known as Twitter, would you have reinstated Alex Jones, yes or no? [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4047.04s)]
*  And then number two, if Alex Jones then as a new member of the community who's been reinstated [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4053.68s)]
*  and forgiven because he apologized, and then he did this again, this exact same thing again, [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4059.68s)]
*  with another school shooting with parents, would you remove him for the platform? [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4066.16s)]
*  I don't know that these are yes or no questions. What I would say is that I've written what I think [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4070.4s)]
*  should be a speech policy for social media platforms in a blog post I did several years ago. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4075.76s)]
*  And what I said is that I would take First Amendment case law and operationalize it for [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4080.96s)]
*  social media platforms. There are nine categories of speech that the Supreme Court has said [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4088.88s)]
*  are not protected speech because they're dangerous in some way. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4093.28s)]
*  So for example, incitement to violence is one of them, harassment is one of them. So I would use- [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4097.92s)]
*  Well, this clearly falls under those two. His fans went and knocked on the doors of his parents. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4103.04s)]
*  His fans did. So as I understand the whole Sandy Hook thing, what happened is he said the whole [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4109.84s)]
*  thing was a hoax. That obviously wasn't true. He paid a huge price for that. His fans then, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4114.72s)]
*  some of his crazy fans went and harassed the parents, which obviously is not right. But [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4120.48s)]
*  according to him, he didn't, and I don't know that anyone's shown that he did that. I don't [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4125.76s)]
*  think he encouraged that. It just happened. Apparently he's got some unhinged fans. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4130.48s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Well, of course he does. It's a conspiracy show. So knowing it's a conspiracy show, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4135.679999999999s)]
*  knowing that incitement to violence is one of your criteria, if his fans, after him saying it's fake, [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4140.24s)]
*  then went to the house, knocked on the door and asked the parent to see little Susie because you [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4147.04s)]
*  know she's alive, would you kick him off the platform? [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4152.4s)]
*  Listen, the Barrington Declaration was declared to be a conspiracy show. The idea that COVID [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4156.64s)]
*  originated in the lab was considered a conspiracy show. I don't think you can prejudge in advance [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4165.12s)]
*  that a show is quote unquote, dangerous, factually wrong conspiracies. As I understand it, again, [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4170.88s)]
*  I haven't watched the show, but I did watch a clip by Joe Rogan, who provided something of a character [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4178.48s)]
*  reference for Alex Jones. I don't know if Nick can find that and play that. It was actually quite [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4182.72s)]
*  good. What Rogan said is, look, I've known Alex Jones for like 30 years. He's had problems with [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4186.400000000001s)]
*  alcohol abuse, substance abuse, whatever. He's had mental health issues that he's acknowledged, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4192.96s)]
*  and sometimes he goes off the rails. At the same time, he's also been way ahead of the curve on [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4197.68s)]
*  certain things. For example, he told me about the Epstein Island like 10 years before the story broke. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4203.280000000001s)]
*  I don't know how he figured that out, but somehow he did. Now, that was a conspiracy theory until it [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4209.36s)]
*  was proven true. It probably would have been a good thing for the public if that story had come out [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4213.759999999999s)]
*  a lot sooner so that it could have been shut down a lot sooner. I don't think you can just [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4218.719999999999s)]
*  judge in advance that somebody is a conspiracy theorist and basically blackball them from the [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4223.28s)]
*  internet. One other data point I want to bring up is that, is something that Elon mentioned, is that [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4227.28s)]
*  he looked at the Twitter tools, the admin tools, to look at Alex Jones's account. The third strike [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4234.16s)]
*  he received that caused him to be banned from the Twitter platform by the former management [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4240.8s)]
*  was he actually insulted a reporter, which was a very borderline case. The things that you're [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4247.5199999999995s)]
*  saying that he was banned for weren't even the reason he was banned. Yeah, no, that's true. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4254.72s)]
*  I think, yeah, so that's why I was framing it to you as, you know, and this is the issue that I [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4258.8s)]
*  think, and maybe what some people are missing here, a mentally ill person like himself, if he's [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4265.52s)]
*  admitted to mental illness and substance abuse, when they do this real, when they go on these [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4270.400000000001s)]
*  tirades, or they go off their meds, or whatever it is, or they're just evil, and they do this for [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4274.64s)]
*  ratings to make money, it starts to cause real world harm. People start showing up on these [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4278.8s)]
*  people's doorsteps. And so then, are you going to wait 10 years for the courts to do this $1.5 [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4283.2s)]
*  billion judgment, and then make the decision while real world harm is occurring? And if you own the [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4289.28s)]
*  platform, my belief is you have a higher standard. I obviously believe in freedom of speech, he can [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4294.32s)]
*  make his own website. But if you own the platform, and the platform enables him to reach a large [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4298.639999999999s)]
*  number of people, and those people are being harmed, and parents' doors are being knocked on, [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4302.96s)]
*  demanding to see their children, because Alex Jones said that child is still alive, and they're [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4306.639999999999s)]
*  trying to take our guns. And he knows his fans are crazy. There's responsibility that comes from [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4310.16s)]
*  it. And there's responsibility that comes with owning a platform like this. I know Elon's going [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4315.12s)]
*  full freedom of speech, but I would be very careful about this. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4318.5599999999995s)]
*  Steve Scalise, the House Republican whip was shot by a crazy Bernie Sanders supporter. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4322.16s)]
*  Does that blame go to Bernie Sanders? I think I have to separate you. There is hold on there. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4327.28s)]
*  There is a legal standard for incitement. Right. Okay. There's a legal standard for judging that [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4332.639999999999s)]
*  you're saying that these crazy people were incited, but there is actually a legal way [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4338.5599999999995s)]
*  of determining that. I don't think that's been proven. I would do a common sense one, which is, [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4342.639999999999s)]
*  do we see real world happening? I would just use common sense. Do we see real world happening? [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4347.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay. Real world is happening. We own the platform. We need to stop this, [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4352.08s)]
*  which is what happened. That's a judgment standard, right? [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4355.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I would make the judgment. If I was the CEO, I'd make the judgment. And I would make [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4358.959999999999s)]
*  the judgment based on, you know, the courts are going to take years to adjudicate this, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4362.639999999999s)]
*  and it's my platform. I don't want this happening. I would operationalize a content moderation [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4366.8s)]
*  policy based on first-moment case law. You're right that you can't always wait for the courts [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4372.64s)]
*  to adjudicate it. There's going to be judgment calls. I would have been fine, I think, with the [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4375.76s)]
*  suspension of Alex Jones in that context, because it does seem pretty egregious and he's apologized [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4380.64s)]
*  for it. The question is whether there should be lifetime bans. And I'm pretty much, I think I'm [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4385.360000000001s)]
*  against lifetime bans. I'm okay with timeouts. I'm okay with suspensions for egregious behavior. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4391.6s)]
*  When somebody has apologized, they've, I mean, had to pay. I mean, I think he's been bankrupted. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4397.6s)]
*  He's had to pay all these fines. I think he's paid his price to society, so to speak. And he's [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4403.68s)]
*  admitted he was wrong. The question is, do you still have the lifetime ban? It seems to me he's [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4410.64s)]
*  acknowledged his mistake. If he doesn't like this again, then you can suspend him. Maybe you do the [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4414.96s)]
*  ban. But I do believe in giving people second chances. And I'm just sort of viscerally against [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4420.64s)]
*  the lifetime banning people. I don't like the standard of what can be deemed dangerous speech, [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4426.72s)]
*  because I think that, as SAC said, there's a clear way to measure whether someone's inciting violence [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4432.4800000000005s)]
*  or inciting harm versus saying speech that can be deemed dangerous in some contexts and then not be [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4438.4800000000005s)]
*  deemed dangerous after the fact. COVID vaccine conversations are the perfect example. Telling [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4445.84s)]
*  people that there's health risks associated with taking a vaccine in the period when everyone was [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4451.28s)]
*  worried about a pandemic killing us all was deemed too dangerous to allow. And after the fact, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4456.56s)]
*  it wasn't dangerous because there was suddenly clear evidence that there may be some costs and [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4462.16s)]
*  benefits associated with the vaccines. And so I really don't like this standard of dangerous [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4466.4800000000005s)]
*  speech. In fact, I think that the biggest changes that are necessary in society initially start with [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4471.12s)]
*  dangerous speech, and then they eventually become true. And then they become a standard, [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4476.24s)]
*  and then things change. My repeated calls for reduction in fiscal spending at the federal level [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4480.72s)]
*  and lack of accountability and fiscal spending at the federal level, by some measure, could be deemed [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4488.16s)]
*  dangerous speech and an incitement against the government. But really, my point is to call out [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4492.4s)]
*  the importance of this issue. And after the fact, I may be right, I may be wrong, and [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4497.2s)]
*  I need to be able to say that. I think it's critically important to say those sorts of things. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4503.679999999999s)]
*  And I think that other people in their own domains will find other things that are critically important [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4507.679999999999s)]
*  to say. And that would be deemed by some standard to be dangerous at the time. So as much as I have [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4511.44s)]
*  great disdain for certain people and certain things that they may say, I do think that what might be [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4516.96s)]
*  deemed dangerous speech is a critical element of the kind of progressivism that's allowed the [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4523.52s)]
*  United States to prosper. I think it was dangerous speech to promulgate the false conspiracy theory [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4529.200000000001s)]
*  that Trump was an agent of Putin. I mean, that was in the Steele dossier. They basically said [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4534.64s)]
*  that Putin had compromised on Trump and Trump was basically working for the Kremlin. I mean, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4539.6s)]
*  he was a traitor. I mean, what if there were people out there who tried to assassinate the [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4545.360000000001s)]
*  president on the grounds that we can't have a traitor in the White House? [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4550.24s)]
*  That was a private document, right? That wasn't like a public talk show. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4554.24s)]
*  No, the Steele dossier was absolutely leaked during the campaign. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4556.48s)]
*  You're making my point. Exactly. It's leaked, right? So there's like a private document by [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4559.28s)]
*  somebody. But then it was printed by Buzzfeed. And then once it was in the echo chamber, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4562.5599999999995s)]
*  it was endlessly repeated by the mainstream media. So the idea that like only people like Alex Jones [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4567.12s)]
*  promote conspiracy theories, the mainstream media promotes a lot of conspiracy theories. And some of [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4574.5599999999995s)]
*  those theories, if acted upon by crazy people, would be just as dangerous as the things that [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4578.0s)]
*  Alex Jones has said. You know, we're in hypothetical land. But actually, I think you and I are not too [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4584.0s)]
*  far apart. You wanting to take these harms and operationalize them is sort of what I'm saying. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4588.24s)]
*  And in each of these cases, it's a judgment call. And this is where I think, you know, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4593.68s)]
*  in many ways, I'm proud of what Elon is doing and saying like freedom of speech is an absolute thing. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4598.48s)]
*  And that's what the platform is going to be his right to do it. It's his platform. And so I'm fine [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4602.96s)]
*  with that. I would do something different if it was my platform. Everybody's different, you know, [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4607.84s)]
*  everybody can can take their stance. I would have some basic humanity as my stance. And I'll be [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4611.92s)]
*  willing to give up a little freedom of speech in my restaurant in my cafe. In order to have it be [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4618.24s)]
*  more delightful for everybody there. I wouldn't go as far as banning people talking about COVID. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4623.52s)]
*  But yeah, if somebody was trying to claim that parents of murdered children were liars and actors, [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4627.68s)]
*  that would be fine for me to say yeah, no good. And then of course, there's Kanye. So, you know, [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4633.76s)]
*  Elon banned Kanye, that was under his realm. And this is what Kanye said. And I think this falls into [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4638.320000000001s)]
*  hate speech and real world harm. I'm a bit sleepy tonight. But when I wake up, I'm going death, [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4642.88s)]
*  death, con three on Jewish people. The funny thing is, I actually can't be anti-Semitic because black [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4647.360000000001s)]
*  people are actually Jew. Also, you guys have played with me and tried to blackball anyone [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4652.8s)]
*  who ever opposes your agenda. So when you see this tweet, would you have banned him sacks? [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4657.360000000001s)]
*  Is that a lifetime ban? I might have given him a timeout. I think his family wanted him to get [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4661.599999999999s)]
*  a timeout because he was having an episode. I certainly wouldn't give him a lifetime ban. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4665.679999999999s)]
*  Give me your something. Look, I don't really know this Alex Jones guy. I certainly don't know my [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4669.839999999999s)]
*  person. I don't even listen to him. It's not a show I'm interested in. Even now. I only know. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4674.48s)]
*  I like knowing the truth. I like hearing facts. And I don't believe that factual information, [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4681.44s)]
*  like the Laveley theory should be censored by labeling it a conspiracy theory. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4687.84s)]
*  Yeah. For example. But what I would say about Alex Jones is there is some humanity in allowing him [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4693.2s)]
*  a forum to apologize for what he did and acknowledge his mistake and explain why he thought [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4700.32s)]
*  what he did and why he was wrong. And that's what he did on X. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4707.84s)]
*  And I went on the Twitter spaces and I asked him a follow up question, which he wouldn't answer. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4711.599999999999s)]
*  I said, how have you changed your behavior? Yeah, but honestly, Jay, [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4715.28s)]
*  because you came, you wouldn't answer it. You came bounding in the last five minutes, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4717.92s)]
*  asking him a bunch of questions about what he did when it had already been covered at the top of [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4722.5599999999995s)]
*  the pod. And I listened to it and he had not answered the question. How has your behavior [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4726.32s)]
*  changed? And so he doesn't want to talk about it. He spent the first half hour relitigating [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4730.08s)]
*  Sandy Hook and you weren't aware of that. It was the first 10 minutes, but he won't answer questions [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4735.28s)]
*  on how he would change his behavior. And so I think that's one of the things I would want to [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4740.5599999999995s)]
*  see from him. How have you changed your behavior and how you, you know, do shows? And I don't think [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4744.0s)]
*  he's answered that question. Anyway, we're going to disagree on this one. Any final thoughts, [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4749.12s)]
*  Chumapa, as we wrap here on this on this issue? The free speech litmus test is very simple. It's [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4752.32s)]
*  this exact thing. It's when the person that you dislike says the thing that you find very [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4759.68s)]
*  displeasing, what do you do? And I am a free speech absolutist on this. I just think it's a very [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4765.04s)]
*  slippery slope and I don't think we're very capable of making these delineations. And so I agree [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4771.52s)]
*  the right solution are timeouts, but lifetime bands, I think, again, go down this path where [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4778.0s)]
*  human judgment gets involved and then it's about the person in charge and then it becomes a power [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4784.160000000001s)]
*  play and then it eventually always gets corrupted. So I can hold two thoughts in my head. One, Alex [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4788.0s)]
*  Jones should be able to say what he thinks and two, it was disgusting and he should be ashamed of [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4793.360000000001s)]
*  what he said. Yeah, you know, the bands doubling every time is probably a good precedent as well. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4799.6s)]
*  So I mean, we should do it like we do at our poker game. The fines go up. Yeah, [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4805.76s)]
*  phone penalty doubles exponential back off. I mean, you're going to you're going to put [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4808.96s)]
*  your phone down and play the goddamn game if it gets to 800 or 1600 because that's things a little [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4814.72s)]
*  bit. So there it is. Yeah, totally does. But maybe that's the right solution. Jason's like, [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4819.120000000001s)]
*  you have a finding mechanism somehow and it just like it increases. And so there's a financial [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4823.120000000001s)]
*  penalty of nothing else as well as a timeout when you violate these laws. At least that's a scalable [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4827.12s)]
*  way to solve the problem in a way that's hard to corrupt and gain. But if it goes down to the person [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4832.32s)]
*  to an individual or a group of people's judgments, as we saw with the previous management of Twitter, [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4839.84s)]
*  I think it's going to be a very difficult problem. I don't think that those were bad people, [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4845.76s)]
*  but I think that they were led astray. Yeah, I mean, Nick, do you have that clip from Rogan? [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4849.2s)]
*  Because when I listened to this clip from Rogan, it did have an impact on what I thought because [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4853.84s)]
*  it does show the human complexity. And again, you're judging him based on the worst thing he [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4860.64s)]
*  ever did. And Rogan presents a more balanced viewpoint about this guy. Again, I have no [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4867.28s)]
*  dog in this hunt. I don't really care about Alex Jones, but I'm just saying that [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4872.88s)]
*  if we're going to sit in judgment of people, I think maybe we should have a more balanced view [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4877.84s)]
*  because it does bias the conversation to play the clip at the worst thing he ever did. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4882.56s)]
*  Let's play Rogan for a second. I think it's interesting. Look at the way people look at [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4886.72s)]
*  Alex Jones now because Alex Jones has been on my podcast a few times. The people that have watched [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4890.080000000001s)]
*  those podcasts think he's hilarious. And they think that he definitely f**ked up with that whole Sandy [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4894.72s)]
*  Hook thing. But he's right more than he's wrong. And he's not an evil guy. He's just a guy who's [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4900.88s)]
*  had some psychotic breaks in his life. He's had some genuine mental health issues that he's [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4909.28s)]
*  addressed. He's had some serious bouts of alcoholism, some serious bouts of substance abuse, [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4913.759999999999s)]
*  and they've contributed to some very poor thinking. But if you know the guy, if you get to know him, [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4920.88s)]
*  like I have, I've known him for more than 20 years. And if you know him on podcasts, you realize he is [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4926.88s)]
*  genuinely trying to unearth some things that are genuinely disturbing for most people. Like, [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4933.2s)]
*  this is a guy that was telling me about Epstein's Island a decade ago, at least. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4941.12s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, this platforming mentally ill people during an episode is a whole other [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4949.04s)]
*  can of worms. I mean, I told this to Lex Reedman when he had Kanye on during that episode. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4955.36s)]
*  I said, I think it's a very bad idea to spend two hours with somebody who's having an episode. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4959.68s)]
*  And sure enough, what did he do? More anti-Semitic insanity on his podcast. And I just told [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4963.52s)]
*  Lex, like, leave the guy alone. It's not worth it. Let him get help. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4969.040000000001s)]
*  Look, I think you have a point there. But, you know, that would be an argument for a temporary [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4973.120000000001s)]
*  suspension, not a ban, in my opinion. Yeah. All right, Sacks. In other news, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4977.4400000000005s)]
*  something insane has happened on the internet. It's never happened before. But somebody has [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4982.72s)]
*  apologized for getting something wrong. This is breaking news. We're in year 34 of the internet. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4988.56s)]
*  And somebody says, is it my wife? Is it my wife? Did she admit she did something? [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4993.52s)]
*  Okay. No, she's never gotten anything wrong. Listen, I've been there for this whole relationship. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=4997.04s)]
*  How's she been? 100 out of 100 times correct on donations. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5001.120000000001s)]
*  Frustrating. It's so frustrating. I mean, if she makes a mistake, we'll know, [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5004.88s)]
*  but it hasn't happened yet. Actually, paradoxically, same with my wife. She's been right for 22 years. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5009.120000000001s)]
*  No, my wife has been wrong four times. And I've gotten three on voice memo, I taped them, [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5013.84s)]
*  I pull out the phone, and I'm like, hold on, I need you to say it again. Yeah. So I've gotten [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5019.68s)]
*  three on voice. But that's because it's been only three. Did those three have something to do with [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5023.76s)]
*  deciding to marry you? Or to move in with you and make children and start a life together? [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5027.84s)]
*  It's so frustrating. How can one person be so wrong? I mean, me all the time. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5033.6s)]
*  Well, I mean, at least you're self aware. Everybody loves self aware. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5038.32s)]
*  It is a new trend in the world. But yes, Nassim Taleb publicly admitted, we're gonna pull it up [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5042.4800000000005s)]
*  here, Sax, here we go. He publicly admitted that techno watermelon. That's your name, Sax. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5049.280000000001s)]
*  That was his insult. I don't really understand the insult. I think he's saying your head is the [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5055.360000000001s)]
*  size of a watermelon and that you're involved in technology. That's my was my interpretation. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5059.92s)]
*  I don't think you have a melon head. Or does it mean like I'm green on the outside and red on the [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5064.16s)]
*  inside or something like somehow I'm supporting communism or I don't really understand it. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5068.56s)]
*  But that has come up. Well, listen, it's better than mine. I'm a psychotic ignoramus. So he's [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5072.080000000001s)]
*  you know, he's never attracted that for some reason. Not yet. Not yet. But at some point, [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5077.360000000001s)]
*  I'm sure he will. But here it is, folks. Well, you just said I can see that David Sax is [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5082.080000000001s)]
*  correct about the relative strength of the parties in the Ukraine war. And I was wrong, all caps. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5086.400000000001s)]
*  Russia is not as weak as it seemed it has staying power. This means a settlement is likely outcome. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5092.240000000001s)]
*  Anyway, it's so rare on the internet for anyone to admit they were wrong. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5097.4400000000005s)]
*  And what they usually do is dismemory hole at which is why you know, I always like to produce [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5104.0s)]
*  receipts only do that for the people who strongly denounce me about something. And then I end up [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5110.320000000001s)]
*  being right. They never can see it's not just about the fact that I was right. It's about the [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5114.320000000001s)]
*  fact that they attacked me personally. And they never come back and apologize or correct the [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5118.240000000001s)]
*  record. And Taleb did that. So kudos to him. I mean, I admit when I read this, I was like, [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5124.08s)]
*  you know, like, yeah, I'm like, okay, what's the gotcha? [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5131.28s)]
*  I thought a trap door is going to open under my feet. I thought a cartoon piano was going to fall [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5138.16s)]
*  in my head. I just I thought this can't be it. And that was it. So that was it. Well, there it is. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5141.84s)]
*  Kudos. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5149.28s)]
*  The reason why I understood what was going to happen in this, you know, counter offensive and [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5152.4s)]
*  why the war is not going to go as well as people thought, it's not because I purport to be some [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5160.5599999999995s)]
*  sort of Ukraine expert or foreign affairs expert, I mainly just spent the time to figure out who the [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5165.28s)]
*  real experts were. And the real experts are never the people who the media tells you. You actually [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5170.0s)]
*  have to spend the time to look at people's track records, what they said in the past, [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5176.32s)]
*  did it come true or not? You know, it's basically a falsifiability standard, look at what they [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5180.719999999999s)]
*  predicted, look at what actually happened. And you can figure out who the real experts are. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5185.92s)]
*  And that's what I did in the case of Ukraine, it was possible to figure out who are the foreign [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5190.48s)]
*  policy scholars who got this right, who are the military bloggers who are accurately reporting [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5194.639999999999s)]
*  information, and who are the ones who are basically putting out propaganda, if you spend the time to [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5199.679999999999s)]
*  do that on virtually any issue, you can effectively become an expert. It's a great point, [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5203.76s)]
*  Seth, really good point. Yeah. Well, you have to find your own process of finding the truth today, [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5209.12s)]
*  because I don't think you can trust the journalists out there to do it. No, you definitely can't. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5214.08s)]
*  100%. And by the way, as a VC, people say, well, what does a VC think? You know, in a way, [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5218.0s)]
*  like what VCs do is when you get interested in a topic, you kind of go deep, you're trying to [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5222.8s)]
*  assimilate a lot of information, you try to figure out who the real experts in the space, [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5226.96s)]
*  so that those are the people I should listen to. And then you develop a take. It's not the [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5230.8s)]
*  worst skill set in the world for doing a pod or tweeting out hot takes on on Twitter. Again, [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5234.08s)]
*  I'm not saying I'm an expert. I'm just somebody who is independent minded enough to get to the [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5240.4800000000005s)]
*  bottom of an issue without just relying on what I'm supposed to believe. And I just try to figure [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5244.96s)]
*  out who the real experts are. All right, producer Nick, are you there? You did a tweet about questions [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5250.24s)]
*  that people might want to have to ask the besties here as we wrap up this episode, [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5256.0s)]
*  we'll take two, your two favorite questions, producer, thoughts on the Harvard board standing [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5259.2s)]
*  behind President Gay despite her transgressions. Okay, that's a good question. That's a good one [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5262.88s)]
*  for Chimah. Here's what I'll say. I think that the Harvard board was probably in a really [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5267.28s)]
*  difficult position in the following way. You know, when you hire somebody, and you realize [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5273.2s)]
*  that that person has some faults, you have three choices, right? One is to fire them. Two is to be [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5282.32s)]
*  unequivocal in their support. And three is to basically give a milk toast, [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5294.32s)]
*  CYA kind of a statement to give yourself time. The reason why I think that President Gay wasn't [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5301.36s)]
*  fired was probably because the board for whatever reason didn't want to seem like they were [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5310.64s)]
*  kowtowing to Bill Ackman and all the other people that were asking for her resignation. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5314.96s)]
*  But what they didn't do is equally important. They may not have fired her. But what they also [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5320.96s)]
*  didn't do was come out with an unequivocal statement of support. I think it was kind of [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5325.04s)]
*  a little bit wishy washy and acknowledging her mistakes, which seems to be a setup to allow her [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5330.0s)]
*  to basically make a couple more mistakes so that then they can fire her and they can all seem like [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5336.8s)]
*  they did the right thing. So I suspect that that's what happens. She probably won't be in that job [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5342.08s)]
*  in a year from now. Or, you know, she kind of muddles along and in two or three years, [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5347.360000000001s)]
*  she quote unquote retires to spend more time with her family. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5351.4400000000005s)]
*  Aaron Norris Anyone else want to get in on this, Sax? [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5353.76s)]
*  Sacks Yeah, I mean, I think this university president's [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5356.72s)]
*  debate has been a little bit of a Rorschach test. And I've seen people that I generally agree with [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5358.64s)]
*  fall into one of two camps. Some see it as a free speech issue. Other people see it as a [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5364.64s)]
*  kind of woke double standards or DEI issue. I think for those who see it as a free speech issue, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5369.76s)]
*  they're emphasizing the motivations of people like Elise Stefanik, the person who asked the [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5375.68s)]
*  university president the question in saying when she said, basically, the question was, [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5381.200000000001s)]
*  does your code of conduct allow calls for genocide of Jews? And their argument is that's a loaded [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5386.72s)]
*  question because there is not an epidemic on campus of people calling for genocide of Jews. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5393.44s)]
*  And so this is basically all kind of an invented hysteria. And the purpose of it is to suppress [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5399.679999999999s)]
*  debate about this Israel Hamas war in Gaza. And it's designed to expand campus speech codes [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5406.4s)]
*  so that it's harder for Palestinian supporters to protest in favor of their cause. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5414.48s)]
*  So that's one way of looking at it. My view on that is if it ends up being the case that [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5421.6s)]
*  campus speech codes get expanded in that way, that'd be a bad thing. I don't think we need [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5429.6s)]
*  to restrict speech on campus. So I agree with them on that point. However, there is a different way [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5433.76s)]
*  of looking at this, which is the motivations of the university presidents in answering that question. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5438.88s)]
*  And yes, it was a loaded question, but they flubbed the answer. And the question is why? [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5444.400000000001s)]
*  Because as we talked about last week, if they were asked about calls for the murder of any other [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5448.96s)]
*  group, a racial group or trans people or something like that, again, I don't think their answer would [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5455.6s)]
*  have been the same. And I do think that that comes back to the fact that they have a preconceived [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5461.2s)]
*  notion of which groups deserve protection and which ones don't. And that is a double standard. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5466.24s)]
*  And I think anything we can do to get rid of that poisonous ideology that wants to treat people [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5471.2s)]
*  differently on campus, I think is a good thing. And so I support what Bill Ackman is doing on that [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5477.76s)]
*  basis. But if Bill Ackman goes too far and demands restrictions on the ability of students to protest, [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5483.6s)]
*  then I think it would be a bad thing. And that's going too far. So this would be a great thing to [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5489.52s)]
*  ask him, like what his motivations are, you know, if he comes on the pod. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5493.04s)]
*  Aaron Norris The thing that's crazy is just the crazy [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5498.0s)]
*  hypocrisy. Like these are the same people who were firing people or not letting them speak on campus [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5500.56s)]
*  if they had a, you know, a microaggression where they didn't, they misgendered somebody, [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5506.32s)]
*  or they used a different pronoun, or they had a different feeling about what defines a woman [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5512.639999999999s)]
*  versus a man or, you know, gender differences, whatever their massive intolerance and the crazy [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5516.719999999999s)]
*  hypocrisy, which you're alluding to here, Sachs, is the thing that I think has broken everybody's [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5521.5199999999995s)]
*  brain. Like, this is bizarre. And the DI stuff is a road to nowhere. I tweeted today about [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5525.12s)]
*  the absolute grift that was going on in tech not long ago, which was call out a company, [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5530.4800000000005s)]
*  venture firm, whatever it is, for their DEI stats, then quietly contact them after you've done this [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5537.04s)]
*  rigadoning of them and say, Hey, we can solve your problem. Hire us as consultants and speakers [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5543.84s)]
*  to come in and fix your DEI and tell you what you've done wrong. And then publicly come out. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5549.4400000000005s)]
*  And I saw this happen. publicly come out and then tell the same group, hey, this person is now an [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5554.32s)]
*  rinse and repeat. It was a crazy grift. And it's all coming out now. And there's a [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5560.56s)]
*  Yeah, that that deal Ackman thing, J. Calvert, you retweeted is crazy. That story. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5563.6s)]
*  Yeah, so we could just go down this rabbit hole forever. But I think you call it a cul de sac, [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5568.8s)]
*  I call it a road to nowhere or dead end. Identity politics and DEI, it's just a dead end when you [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5573.360000000001s)]
*  start judging people based on, you know, any criteria other than their character and performance [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5578.56s)]
*  in the world. Do we know if there was a response by [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5583.6s)]
*  MIT is this one? MIT? Yeah, I don't I don't think yet there has been so [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5588.8s)]
*  anyway, we'll cover that story next week for sure. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5592.88s)]
*  Doing is brave because he is taking on DEI. And that is, or historically, that's been one of the [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5596.96s)]
*  most dangerous things you can do. I mean, that is what people get canceled for. Now I know there are [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5602.8s)]
*  people who I am fans of, like like Glenn Greenwald, who's been very critical of Ackman, [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5608.16s)]
*  because he thinks that Ackman is trying to restrict free speech and prevent, again, [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5614.4800000000005s)]
*  the pro Palestinian cause from protesting or saying its piece. And I guess Bill can clarify that. But [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5619.12s)]
*  I think this issue is less about foreign policy and more about domestic policy, these DEI policies. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5626.96s)]
*  And finally, we have someone who's willing to take it on and challenge it challenge it at an [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5633.44s)]
*  ideological level and then challenge it like a just grift level. Yeah, shout out to Brian Armstrong, [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5638.799999999999s)]
*  he got this right. And he went right up the hill and took the arrows for it. And I think we've [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5644.719999999999s)]
*  turned a corner. If you the tweet I did today, I would not have done two years ago, because I just [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5648.96s)]
*  didn't want to, you know, risk my firm or the companies I work with, you know, to kind of [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5654.0s)]
*  expose that grift because it could blow back on people. So but now I feel totally comfortable [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5659.6s)]
*  doing it. So Ubers at 70. Well, that also puts me in that mode. That's for sure. He's got a few [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5665.120000000001s)]
*  money now. Ackman's got a lot of firepower. You know, that bond call was totally right. No, [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5673.84s)]
*  the 10 years now sub 4% say. Yeah, I will say that does your bank account does give you the ability [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5678.4800000000005s)]
*  to go Okay, final question, please, we have, we must wrap, we must have a final question, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5685.52s)]
*  and please throw it to Friedberg. First, I got Friedberg involved early on offense today. It's [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5689.4400000000005s)]
*  a great show from mom cooks fast and slow on X for Friedberg, I guess, what is the correct way [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5695.280000000001s)]
*  to hire kids out of school now that an elite university degree tells you very little about [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5701.040000000001s)]
*  the applicant? And will you follow this path in your own companies? Oh, I have a great answer for [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5704.96s)]
*  Kim, go ahead. No, please, let's rebar. You got to go to the schools with co op. Why? Because it [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5710.400000000001s)]
*  allows you to evaluate these kids in situ on a real time basis without an obligation to hire. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5716.64s)]
*  You can find the ones that can really do the work have the energy. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5723.28s)]
*  Explain programs, please. It's for people don't know. I went to a co op school, University of [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5726.72s)]
*  Waterloo in Canada, the way that it works there, not not everywhere, but there at least is you [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5731.04s)]
*  go to school for the first eight months. And then you never get a break, you're either in [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5737.28s)]
*  working for four months, or you're in school for four months, and you go back and forth until you [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5742.24s)]
*  graduate. So instead of graduating in four years, you graduate in five. But you graduate with with [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5746.5599999999995s)]
*  basically two full years of work experience. And depending on the employers that you work at, [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5752.96s)]
*  you typically get two to three job offers from those folks if you do a good job. When I [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5759.599999999999s)]
*  was helping to build Facebook, we went there, we had never hired an intern before and we started [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5764.0s)]
*  to hire people and I think now it happened in Microsoft, it happened at Google, I think it's [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5768.56s)]
*  happened to Facebook, if you look at the number of kids that work at those schools now from co op [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5773.76s)]
*  schools, they're higher than any other school. There's a bunch of schools in the United States [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5779.52s)]
*  that have co op. But I would go and find those schools and hire those kids. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5783.84s)]
*  Freeburg, any thoughts? You're now running a company, you're back in the saddle. How are you [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5789.44s)]
*  going to hire people? And tell everybody the name of the company again. It's called Ohalo. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5794.4s)]
*  Ohalo, not Mahalo. Ohalo. And you're [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5799.5199999999995s)]
*  Mahalo was taken. Who owns that domain name now? [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5804.16s)]
*  I still have it. Yeah, if somebody wants to [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5806.5599999999995s)]
*  You have it. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5808.4s)]
*  I have Mahalo and I have Kukua. Have it sell it to somebody if they want to. But tell us how are you [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5809.12s)]
*  happy to sell it to somebody if they want to. But tell us how are you what your hiring criterion? [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5815.2s)]
*  How do you think about this now? [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5819.12s)]
*  I'd like to start an enterprise software business called Kukua. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5820.16s)]
*  It means to help or to guide in Hawaiian. So probably the third or fourth most important word. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5823.76s)]
*  Go ahead, Freeburg, please. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5829.84s)]
*  I have criteria around raw horsepower, skills or experience and then motivation. And I have [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5831.12s)]
*  systems for how we try and assess those and then matching our principles. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5838.0s)]
*  It's kind of the fourth bucket of things. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5841.92s)]
*  Horsepower you can test skills is based on experience and fits the role and the need. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5844.8s)]
*  But motivation is one that there's a lot of question marks around. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5849.599999999999s)]
*  Does this person have they demonstrated that they've had a not just a desire but an action [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5854.639999999999s)]
*  that they've taken that has pushed them beyond the limits of the systems that they've operated in? [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5861.599999999999s)]
*  And that's what I would typically look for regardless of the schooling background. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5866.24s)]
*  The education background is some demonstration of that because that's necessary in business [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5870.88s)]
*  building. So that's my framework for hiring. We call it, you know, smarts or horsepower, [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5875.4400000000005s)]
*  skills, motivation and principles. And we score each one of those and then try and come up with [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5881.12s)]
*  hiring. You started to do that with the CEO candidates. I got that email from you and I [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5885.4400000000005s)]
*  was very intrigued. So I like that. All right, everybody. This has been another amazing episode [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5889.68s)]
*  of the All In Podcast for the King of Beep and the Dictator and the Rain Man himself. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5894.72s)]
*  I'm your boy, Jay Kal. We'll see you next time. Bye-bye. Love you guys. Bye-bye. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5902.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5924.72s)]
*  we should all just get a room and just have one big huge door because they're all just like this, [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5937.84s)]
*  like sexual tension, but they just need to release them out. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85An9FVsb0&t=5942.16s)]
