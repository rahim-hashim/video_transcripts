*  We did a long mountain bike ride with our other buddies. And family barbecue last night. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=58.2s)]
*  Very nice. I had a good time. What'd you do? Little portobello mushrooms? What'd you do? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=64.6s)]
*  You put a little zucchini on the grill? Let's just say I show up with my own food to a barbecue. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=68.64s)]
*  Absolutely you do. All right. And everybody's favorite, the chairman dictator, Chamath Pali [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=73.0s)]
*  Hapatiya. You love him. You hate him, but you can't ignore him. How you do? Look at the number [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=80.6s)]
*  of buttons here. You got the mouth collar on. And I don't think any of those buttons are [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=84.92s)]
*  button. None of them are button. You became a meme once again, once again, the all in [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=89.4s)]
*  podcast creating memes, you were swirling, you were swirling a little white one last [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=94.76s)]
*  week. You were in the arena and I'm putting up all the numbers going macro and you're swirling [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=98.88s)]
*  wine. The audience loved it. What's going on today? Do you have a bottle? That was a 2019 [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  Cadillabozco. Really, really clean. Can you tell us the flavor profile, the notes? What did you [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=109.44s)]
*  get? What did you get as you were swirling? There was some plum. There's a little truffle there. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=115.52s)]
*  The boysenberries. Little boysenberry. Fantastic. A little moth. It was a touch of inflation [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=121.72s)]
*  with the hints of unemployment. Boys, I had a big week. I had a big week this week. I'm at the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=128.24s)]
*  lake still, but I made a little trip to Silicon Valley. I was hanging out with Ruloff at Sequoia. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=154.68s)]
*  As I'm prone to do, I love to go to Bucks. You guys been to Bucks before in Woodside? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=160.12s)]
*  Yeah, I went once a couple years. I've never been back since. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=164.36s)]
*  Okay. Well, it's my favorite place to get breakfast or get my little tuna melt. I've been going there [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=168.20000000000002s)]
*  for ages. It's a little bit of a legendary place where Steve Jervison made the Hotmail investment, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  the Tesla investment, all kinds of famous stuff happens at Bucks. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=177.72s)]
*  Well, it's where PayPal got its first funding round where John Malloy from Nokia Ventures [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=180.52s)]
*  beamed the money to Peter and Max at Bucks. On a PalmPilot. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  On PalmPilot way back in 1999. Yeah. For those people who don't know, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=190.60000000000002s)]
*  PalmPilot was the most innovative and poorly designed product in the last century. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=194.12s)]
*  That was J-PAL's nickname in college. Oh my God. Well done. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=199.16000000000003s)]
*  That's so good. So good. But I'm wearing my Bucks hat and I got my Bucks menu here. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=203.4s)]
*  Boys, it was like a pinnacle of my career. I've been waiting for this. If you go to Bucks [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=209.88s)]
*  and you look at the side, you can get your crispy Brussels sprouts there, Freiburg, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  get your sweet potato fries. But there it is. J-PAL's onion rings are now on the menu at Bucks. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  I have hit the big leagues, folks. Wait, is that, is that real? Did you really get that? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  I did. I'm the first person. But I love onion rings. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=230.84s)]
*  I love a good tuna melt. It's a weird sandwich, but they do it so great there. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=235.4s)]
*  And I keep asking for onion rings for like a decade. And then we don't do onion rings. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=239.88s)]
*  Yeah. And so suddenly, you know, that the team there comes out, they say, J-PAL, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=245.4s)]
*  we have two different types of onion rings. Please pick which one you like best. I went with the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=248.84s)]
*  panko crusted Freiburg. These are for you. Delicious panko crusted. And they put them on [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=251.88s)]
*  the menu. So I was so touched. I just want to give a shout out to them. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=257.64s)]
*  While we're on, while we're on sandwiches. Sure. You know what I love? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=260.28s)]
*  What do you love? A Reuben made with turkey breast instead [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=264.12s)]
*  of pastrami. Have you guys ever had a turkey? I haven't. Oh, it's incredible. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=269.0s)]
*  Because I think a pastrami Reuben is a little too much. It just feels too sclerotic. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=274.12s)]
*  Too fatty. Like your arteries are. Yeah, it's terrible. But like you get a good thousand [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=280.12s)]
*  island sauce and like the sauerkraut and cheese. It's made. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=284.6s)]
*  I took my, I took when I was in New York a couple of weeks ago, I took my daughter to [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=288.76s)]
*  Katz's deli. I took her on a little tour of the Lower East Side. And we made a stop at Katz's. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=291.48s)]
*  What's your favorite Sammy there? Max's deli, by the way, has a turkey. Max's deli. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=295.64s)]
*  Why did you do a paid promo for bucks at Woodside? I don't, they gave you a hat. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=300.2s)]
*  Every time they sell one of those onion rings, I get $1 on my account. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=304.44s)]
*  Of course. I get a free tune amount. The Griff never ends. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=308.2s)]
*  I don't get it. I only podcast to sell onion rings. Perfect. Okay. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=311.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, you're selling potatoes and schmatz is getting Lora Piana. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  To sell onion rings. Onion rings and Lora Piana. We go high, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=319.88s)]
*  we go low. They go high, we go low. They go low, we go high. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=323.72s)]
*  All right. Listen, schmatz big O outcome is on the table. The DOJ is looking at breaking up Google. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=327.24s)]
*  This is huge news in our industry. Last week, we talked about the ruling that Google had an [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=332.76000000000005s)]
*  illegal monopoly in search and advertising. The case was brought by Trump's DOJ back in 2020. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=337.48s)]
*  Schmatz said two outcomes are possible. Little O big O, little O consent degree, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=344.52000000000004s)]
*  like Microsoft did back in 2000 with the Internet Explorer decision. The big O, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=349.16s)]
*  we didn't think that was a major possibility, but here we are. Google getting broken up. DOJ [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=355.40000000000003s)]
*  is going big O. On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported the DOJ is considering a breakup. According to [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=360.76000000000005s)]
*  the article, most likely breakup targets are Android OS, Google Chrome, and AdWords. Okay. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=365.8s)]
*  Last time the government tried to break up a monopoly was 20 years ago when they tried and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=371.16s)]
*  failed to dismantle Microsoft. We know how that's gone. The company's doing great. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=375.4s)]
*  So let's talk about it. Aside from search and advertising, there's kind of five pillars at [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=379.64s)]
*  Google and your former Google, which will go to you first, Freberg, I think. Cloud, 40 billion in [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=384.03999999999996s)]
*  revenue growing 30%, YouTube, 34 billion growing 15%. Little volatile because it's advertising [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=388.67999999999995s)]
*  that doesn't include like premium YouTube TV and that stuff. But oh my Lord, YouTube is up to 2.7 [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=394.52s)]
*  billion monthly active users. World population is 8.2. So quite significant. Netflix has 38 [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=400.68s)]
*  billion in revenue that they're worth almost 300 billion. So that's an interesting corollary. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=406.76s)]
*  You got Waymo doing 50,000 paid trips a week now, 2.5 million a year, and that's growing [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=410.52s)]
*  quite nicely. You got Android, right? They don't disclose revenue. You got the G Suite. So [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=418.04s)]
*  let's start with you, Freberg, and then I'll go to you Chamath, because you made the prediction. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=423.72s)]
*  What do you think would be accretive or generally increase the market cap and be something that [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=427.88s)]
*  Google would be happy with and the government would be happy with if you had to like maybe [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=435.48s)]
*  shed one or two properties? What's a possible outcome here? Send your thoughts broadly on this. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=439.32s)]
*  I'll just start by commenting. I'm not really sure what the improvement to consumer pricing [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=444.28s)]
*  or competition would be in different breakup scenarios. I'd really like to understand the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=452.44s)]
*  DOJ's analysis on that. How does breaking up one of these things improve the consumer experience? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=458.76s)]
*  I could see the case for Android because Android defaults to Google search. But again, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=467.47999999999996s)]
*  Android's an open source operating system. And so everyone has their own fork or a lot of the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=472.35999999999996s)]
*  handset manufacturers will have their own fork of Android. Obviously, the Google fork [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=477.32s)]
*  defaults to Google search. So it benefits Google services quite well. I think that would be an [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=481.96s)]
*  analysis that the DOJ would really have to kind of prove out that there is real anti-competition [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=486.44s)]
*  associated with Google's influence over the open source Android operating system fork that they [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=492.68s)]
*  manage and license out. I think understanding that would be good. I do think that there's a [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=496.92s)]
*  lot of value unlock in YouTube. So if Google were to just generally spin out YouTube, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=501.64s)]
*  that is probably a business that on its own would attract an investor base that might otherwise not [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=507.88s)]
*  want to get into the conglomerate. And there's always this notion of what's called a conglomerate [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=515.24s)]
*  discount. When you put a lot of different businesses together, the businesses in aggregate [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=519.48s)]
*  get valued less than the individual parts would be valued on their own because different investors [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=524.92s)]
*  interested in a business investment thesis would like to bet on cloud, would like to bet on YouTube, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=530.36s)]
*  would like to bet on AI. And so each one of these kind of like segments, if they can be unlocked, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=536.6s)]
*  can actually be value creating in terms of overall market cap. The challenge is the way YouTube's [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=542.36s)]
*  infrastructure operates. It operates on shared infrastructure with the rest of Google services. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=548.52s)]
*  So does cloud, so does search, so does AdWords. So there's one common cloud infrastructure that [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=552.76s)]
*  everything runs on. And then there's one common advertiser pool. There are dedicated advertising [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=558.84s)]
*  salespeople within YouTube, but there's also dedicated shared infrastructure on advertising [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=566.44s)]
*  between YouTube and search and AdSense and so on. And there's ad sales teams that actually can sell [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=570.6s)]
*  across search and third party publisher sites and YouTube. And so breaking up those shared teams [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=576.36s)]
*  becomes a little more technically difficult. But YouTube certainly seems like an unlock. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=583.08s)]
*  The question is what happens with all the infrastructure layer? Does that go with cloud? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=587.72s)]
*  And if it does, then YouTube, AdWords and search all become customers of cloud. So that might be [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=591.08s)]
*  one way that this could work. But I think net net, if this were to happen, there could be a lot of [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=597.4s)]
*  upside in the market cap. I'll also say it just feels like the tenor of all of this is anti-success [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=602.28s)]
*  and not anti-competition. And anything that's kind of successful or big is automatically deemed [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=610.84s)]
*  to be a monopoly. And I think we really have to kind of understand how are consumers and the [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=617.56s)]
*  market for competition being affected by having all these things together. And that's what should [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=622.68s)]
*  really be focused on and studied, not just the fact that something is big and successful. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=627.2399999999999s)]
*  We'll see how that all plays out. All right, Shamatha, you predicted the possibility of a [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=631.56s)]
*  big O. Here we are. Your thoughts on what this might look like, chances of it happening, and then [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=635.9599999999999s)]
*  just maybe if you're interested in the anti-success approach here, or do you think this is more [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=642.6s)]
*  valid criticism of Google's massive search monopoly? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=650.12s)]
*  Well, when I painted that series of outcomes, just kind of like looking forward, I really [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=656.6800000000001s)]
*  didn't think that this big O outcomes was a very large probability. I would have handicapped that [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=664.52s)]
*  single digit percentages. And I think the reason why the DOJ leaked this thing and floated this [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=670.92s)]
*  trial balloon essentially is in part, I didn't weigh enough what Sachs was talking about, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=679.16s)]
*  which is that there really is a massive bipartisan amount of support against Google. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=686.84s)]
*  Now, it cuts on two different dimensions. I think that there is one dimension, which is more [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=695.0s)]
*  Republican oriented, which is just about freedom of speech and putting your thumb on the scale. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=700.92s)]
*  But if you take the Democratic point of view, it's more the anti-successful [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=706.76s)]
*  vein that Freebird just mentioned. The thing is, though, that it'll make strange bedfellows, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=712.52s)]
*  because it unites both sides against pushing for a big outcome. If you go back to the last big O [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=718.44s)]
*  outcome that we had in antitrust law, which was AT&T in the 70s and 80s, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=728.0400000000001s)]
*  that lawsuit was a decade long. And essentially what happened was when [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=736.2800000000001s)]
*  it looked like AT&T was going to lose the case, they were the ones that proposed splitting itself [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=742.12s)]
*  up. And so I think that this is going to start this really interesting chess game here, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=749.32s)]
*  where obviously Google has to appeal and fight this. But if it looks like the political pressure [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=756.2800000000001s)]
*  is going to build and the courts aren't going to let them off the hook and have a little O outcome, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=762.2800000000001s)]
*  probably the best thing to do is for Google to initiate it themselves, because they can answer [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=767.48s)]
*  a lot of the questions that Freebird just raised. And they'll do it in a way where going back to [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=772.36s)]
*  the people that matter, along with the customers and the employees or the shareholders, you can do [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=780.2s)]
*  it in a way where the sum of the parts will be greater than the value today of Google. So I think [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=786.76s)]
*  that there's a shareholder win. It needs to be offered by Google and then negotiated. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=792.28s)]
*  But to be really honest with you, Jason, when I kind of was thinking about it last week, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=798.6s)]
*  I really thought this was a single digit probability. I still think it's a single digit [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=802.76s)]
*  probability. And if it grows, it's the most meaningful thing that's happened in technology, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=807.0s)]
*  quite honestly. All right, Sax? From a business perspective. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=812.68s)]
*  Well, Sax, your thoughts? I agree with you. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=816.12s)]
*  I agree with Chamath that Google has the opportunity to do something really interesting [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=818.92s)]
*  here, which is get ahead of the curve and break itself up before the political system forces that [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=826.1999999999999s)]
*  onto it. And the advantage of doing that is that it could partition the company in ways [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=832.04s)]
*  that are economically smart. The big categories would be search, advertising and YouTube. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=836.68s)]
*  And I think that would have two big economic benefits for shareholders. One is [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=842.76s)]
*  you unlock value by deconglomerating, like Freeberg was saying. Second, once you break up the [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=846.92s)]
*  company into these pieces, there's less places for employees who aren't doing anything to hide, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=852.44s)]
*  for all this bureaucracy to hide. I mean, look, Google is famous for employees who don't do [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=858.6s)]
*  anything, right? The guys sitting on the roof, stunning themselves all day. If you break up the [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=864.36s)]
*  company into three or four smaller companies, right, there's just way less room for people [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=868.84s)]
*  to hide. And I think that they could all be leaner, more efficient operations, and that would accrue [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=873.56s)]
*  to the benefit of shareholders. So I think that would make a lot of sense. And then furthermore, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=878.92s)]
*  I guess a third point is that you first all the possibility of the government [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=883.88s)]
*  doing something that could actually be very harmful. And the piece here is that I guess the DOJ is [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=887.9599999999999s)]
*  talking about spinning up Android and Chrome. And I think it's worth pointing out that those aren't [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=895.4s)]
*  really businesses in and of themselves. The reason why Google developed Android and Chrome [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=901.72s)]
*  was to prevent anybody from getting upstream of them, right? They saw what Microsoft did in terms [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=908.2s)]
*  of capturing the operating system and then capturing the browser. And they didn't want to [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=913.8000000000001s)]
*  potentially allow Microsoft or anyone else to essentially win the high ground, capture the [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=917.32s)]
*  high ground upstream of them, and be able to divert traffic away from search to their own search [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=923.32s)]
*  engine or someone else's search engine. So they began the strategy of commoditizing those layers [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=928.44s)]
*  of the stack. And it worked brilliantly. I mean, Android and Chrome have become very popular, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=934.0400000000001s)]
*  and it guarantees that nobody else can get upstream of them and then dis-remediate them. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=940.0400000000001s)]
*  But the problem is, if those things get spun out and have to become businesses on their own, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=945.0s)]
*  how would they function as businesses? It's not clear to me that there's an obvious strategy there. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=950.84s)]
*  I would like to ask Freeberg. Freeberg, do you see a way that Chrome and Android could be spun out [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=954.92s)]
*  and become viable businesses on their own? Or do you agree that they were essentially created [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=962.5999999999999s)]
*  to commoditize layers of the stack rather than become profitable businesses on their own? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=969.64s)]
*  Yeah. So they were both created to avoid third parties blocking access to Google search. That's [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=973.64s)]
*  why they were both started. And remember, Sundar was the product manager on Chrome originally. That [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=981.32s)]
*  was his big product that he ran for quite some time. So Android was all about making sure that [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=985.6400000000001s)]
*  the handset manufacturers didn't basically default consumers to do search and use the internet in a [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=991.6400000000001s)]
*  way that would disadvantage Google. So Google said, you know what? Just like Zuck is doing currently [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=997.5600000000001s)]
*  with Llama, Google said, let's make an open-sourced mobile operating system that's better than any [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1002.84s)]
*  other mobile operating system. And we'll make sure that consumers have choice and they have [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1008.76s)]
*  the ability to go where they want to go. And it's not just defaulted by the telcos or the [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1012.52s)]
*  handset manufacturers. So that was the reason. And obviously they ended up making their own fork of [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1016.28s)]
*  Android, which is the most popular fork of Android that has Google as a default search engine. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1021.24s)]
*  So yeah, and they get license fees from that. But fundamentally, it's really just in service [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1025.8s)]
*  of making sure that people go to Google search. So where that ends up sitting in a split up company, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1030.52s)]
*  I have no idea. And Chrome, similarly, you know, Google originally supported Firefox and gave a [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1036.28s)]
*  lot of money to Firefox. And then Firefox just wasn't moving fast enough. So Google started [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1043.32s)]
*  hiring Firefox engineers and built Chrome in-house as a way to keep Netscape and Internet [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1047.72s)]
*  Explorer from blocking access to Google search and defaulting. And they built a default to [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1052.84s)]
*  Google search, obviously. What do you think, Jekyll? You know, I have a long relationship [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1057.72s)]
*  with Google as a content creator and they do have a massive monopoly in search. That's [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1062.04s)]
*  absolutely true. And the Justice Department, I think, is well within their rights to take a [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1067.08s)]
*  deep dive on that. They don't have it in ads. If you look at the competition for Google in [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1072.28s)]
*  advertising, you got Meta, TikTok and Amazon, which have very, very significant advertising [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1077.72s)]
*  businesses, and then like a bunch of new players, which are referred to basically as the shopping [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1081.8799999999999s)]
*  cart and networks, that's Uber, Instacart, DoorDash, et cetera. And so when you look at this, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1086.52s)]
*  it's kind of paradoxical that it really does rhyme with what happened with Microsoft. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1092.6s)]
*  They're two decades late on this. The search monopoly has been squeezed for every dollar [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1098.04s)]
*  and to build every subcomponent of Google's monopoly. Flights, shopping, all of these things [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1104.36s)]
*  put into Google search and put at the top above organic search has basically killed hundreds, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1113.16s)]
*  hundreds of startups over the decades. And so I actually don't think this is going to do much if [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1119.24s)]
*  they do a breakup. The easy solution for Google, and I agree with I think people who said that here, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1125.0s)]
*  is to just spin out YouTube and Waymo. Those two are perfect standalone businesses. Yeah, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1130.68s)]
*  there's some backend stuff, but like you said, Freeberg, they could become customers of the ad [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1135.0800000000002s)]
*  network of the cloud for some number of years. But YouTube and Waymo, those would be like a [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1139.72s)]
*  $400 billion company, a $50 billion company, and those are right in the zeitgeist of the future [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1144.28s)]
*  and what advertisers want. So I think offering those two up would unlock massive shareholder value. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1150.04s)]
*  The most damaging one would be Android. If they force them to sell Android, that is going to be [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1155.8s)]
*  massively damaging because an independent Android company could then give their search default to [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1161.16s)]
*  Bing and Microsoft would happily bid for that. Not good. They must in order to capture [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1166.68s)]
*  the maximum economic value. They would auction it. Right. And so I mean losing every... On Google's [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1173.4s)]
*  fork of Android, right? Correct. And so that is the dominant player. And then they have handsets. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1178.1200000000001s)]
*  So that Android company... How much is that worth? How much is that worth? Because maybe that does [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1183.0s)]
*  make Android a viable business on its own. It would be probably worth... It's probably $30 billion [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1186.68s)]
*  of revenue a year. Okay, great. So let's do it. I take back what I said. It can survive as an [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1190.92s)]
*  independent business. Chrome can't, right? Chrome can't. But maybe Android and Chrome go together. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1195.72s)]
*  That would be incredibly damaging to Google. That's the most damaging. The easiest is YouTube [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1200.84s)]
*  and Waymo in this whole mix. But I'll give you the wild card in all of this. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1206.44s)]
*  Think about the math. Sorry, just real quick. Think about the math on that. So let's say it [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1210.6000000000001s)]
*  spins out and it generates $30 billion of revenue a year and Google owns the majority of it. And [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1214.1200000000001s)]
*  eventually they'll sell it down. But that business will be valued on the money that Google's paying. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1218.68s)]
*  So Google will make that equity value back because they own the shares. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1223.08s)]
*  And they will lose one third of their revenue to that new company. Now, of course, they'll get it [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1225.8799999999999s)]
*  back in the equity, but then they don't have it because about a third of searches are mobile now. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1229.8s)]
*  And that's increasing. The big wild card in all this is Apple. When I was doing Mahalo, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1234.28s)]
*  which was a human powered search in over 10 years ago, that's Sequoia back, I emailed it to Steve [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1240.04s)]
*  Jobs. He opened it. He played with it a bunch. I won't talk about anything else in that regard. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1245.0s)]
*  But they had a search project in the works when Steve Jobs was in charge over there. They were [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1251.24s)]
*  looking at search because he had such an axe to grind with Eric Schmidt because they launched [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1255.96s)]
*  Android and he kicked Eric Schmidt off the board. And there was a lot of hand wringing there. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1261.96s)]
*  I think Apple is, and I've heard this from folks around Apple, that they're looking at search again. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1265.96s)]
*  And there's DuckDuckGo and there's a company called Brave that has their own search engine, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1271.8s)]
*  search API that's gotten very popular. I believe Apple is going to launch their own search engine [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1276.52s)]
*  and compete heads up with Google. And so I think that's going to be the very interesting thing [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1281.16s)]
*  that happens in this market. The question then becomes, Chema, does this distract management [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1286.2s)]
*  to a level like it did Microsoft, then you have a lost decade and it takes their eyes off the prize [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1292.28s)]
*  of AI? No. And the reason I say no is that I think that people's reaction to these things become [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1296.76s)]
*  more sophisticated in time because folks go back and actually study what happened [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1308.36s)]
*  in the Ma Bell situation, AT&T in the R-Box, what happened in Microsoft. And so I suspect that [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1315.56s)]
*  they know how to shield the rank and file employee from whatever's going to happen. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1323.3200000000002s)]
*  So I think that that's less likely. I think- [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1328.28s)]
*  I was referring to management. Do you think it distracts management from running the business, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1331.96s)]
*  Chema? I don't think so either because I think that these things get put into a very [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1338.68s)]
*  tight group of people, mostly lawyers, who then go and deal with this issue. I think that there's [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1344.76s)]
*  an acute moment where if they think that they're going to lose an appeal or that appeal is not [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1351.96s)]
*  going to get heard, then yeah, I do think management and the board are brought together. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1357.4s)]
*  And again, if history is a guide, they should want to propose the terms on which they break [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1362.3600000000001s)]
*  their own company up. Because I think if the government tries to decide, there's going to be [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1370.28s)]
*  so much imprecision that they'll break the company. And I think that would be a shame because, I mean, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1376.6000000000001s)]
*  look, take a step back. The breaking up of Google is great for competition and for startups. But [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1381.32s)]
*  let's not forget, Google is an incredible company that has created enormous amounts of good. They [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1390.2s)]
*  have done way more good than bad, way more, like three, four or five orders of magnitude, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1396.04s)]
*  more good than bad. And to break a company like that, I think would be a really bad outcome. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1401.8s)]
*  From a competitive dynamics perspective and game theory, it's pretty reasonable to hobble them. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1411.3999999999999s)]
*  That's why I think the small o outcome is much more palatable and seems more fair to me. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1416.12s)]
*  A breakup is a really draconian action. And I'm not sure that when you look at Google versus AT&T [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1423.1599999999999s)]
*  and the baby bells, I don't think it's anywhere near the same. But if there's the political will, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1428.84s)]
*  they'll be able to craft and change some of the laws that allow these folks to just keep going [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1436.4399999999998s)]
*  after them. And if that happens, I think it's going to be really important for Google to define [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1441.9599999999998s)]
*  the terms of their own breakup. I want to just underline what Chamoff said real quick. Being big [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1447.0s)]
*  can be very good in the sense that it can drive an ability to invest in innovation that is not [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1451.9599999999998s)]
*  possible without the scale and the significant cash flow that's being generated by being that big. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1459.08s)]
*  AT&T is a great example. Bell Labs. The way AT&T was set up is there was all the local telephone [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1465.24s)]
*  companies under this Bell system that AT&T owned. And then Western Electric was the company that [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1471.56s)]
*  manufactured all the telephone equipment that was put into the telephone system. And then Bell Labs [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1476.68s)]
*  was the third entity. It was the research arm. And all that they did at Bell Labs was do research, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1482.6s)]
*  and they were fully funded. They had all this cash flow pouring into them so they could discover [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1487.32s)]
*  and work on and invent whatever they wanted. With that capital, Bell Labs is so insane. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1492.3600000000001s)]
*  If you guys haven't read any of the books on Bell Labs and what was discovered there and how it [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1497.96s)]
*  operated, it truly is the most innovative center ever in human history. But they invented antenna [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1502.2s)]
*  arrays, they invented microwaves, they invented radar, they invented the transistor, they invented [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1509.08s)]
*  information theory, which was the basis for everything in the internet. There was even some [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1514.2s)]
*  efforts to try and invent a nuclear bomb before the Manhattan Project started. They invented [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1519.72s)]
*  integrated circuits, and on and on and on and on. And that's because they could invest all this money [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1525.3999999999999s)]
*  in doing this research that would have been very difficult for a small startup or a company that's [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1530.6799999999998s)]
*  trying to grow and is barely profitable to be able to do. At Google, they've invested billions of [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1534.84s)]
*  dollars in Waymo. And I think as we all know, Waymo really was, if not the leader, but the inspiration [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1538.84s)]
*  for a whole generation of autonomous driving that ultimately will come to market and will [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1544.36s)]
*  really transform our lives in a meaningful way. In the same way Amazon and Microsoft and Meta have [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1548.68s)]
*  all invested tens of billions of dollars in innovation. Look at what Zuck is doing at Meta [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1554.76s)]
*  with the open sourcing of the llama models. It's incredible. That would have never been possible [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1559.24s)]
*  if you had a small company that was trying to get profitable. So I just want to highlight, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1563.88s)]
*  these businesses, just because they're big and successful, doesn't necessarily mean that they're [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1568.68s)]
*  stifling innovation. In fact, they may be accelerating innovation and enabling progress. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1572.92s)]
*  I'm just pointing out that the cash flows that are being generated and the way they're investing [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1577.32s)]
*  those cash flows is pretty impressive. And we lose that if we end up going after every big company, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1580.2s)]
*  just because they're big and saying, hey, we should take away their ability to do this. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1586.84s)]
*  I'm going to take the other side of that. I think that what they can do with their massive amount of [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1590.76s)]
*  power is destructive to competition in the marketplace. If you look at self-driving, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1595.56s)]
*  we have had tens of billions of dollars invested without Waymo. It would have been just fine. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1601.08s)]
*  There have been so much money, Tesla, Uber, Cruz, GM. There's plenty of people out there. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1606.52s)]
*  There's plenty of capital out there from around the world. And I think when these companies, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1613.16s)]
*  in Facebook's one, I think proves my point, what you're saying here is, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1617.8799999999999s)]
*  I think it would be better that you didn't have these companies that could put $20 billion into [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1622.04s)]
*  something and you had 50 startups go after it rather than these giant companies just steal it [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1626.04s)]
*  and overpower them, flooding them with capital. It makes the world less dynamic that Zuck can just [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1631.8s)]
*  Google can keep taking the next category from the marketplace. Go ahead, Sax, you had a point? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1636.52s)]
*  If you break Google up from a conglomerate of let's call it four monopolies or duopolies or [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1642.52s)]
*  companies with extraordinary market power into four separate companies, they're still going to [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1647.96s)]
*  be generating extraordinary profits and those could still be invested in a Waymo. So I don't [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1652.04s)]
*  know that it stops the innovation. Our workshopping this issue has pretty much convinced me that it [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1656.92s)]
*  should be four companies, search, advertising, YouTube and Android, because I think Android could [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1661.56s)]
*  be a standalone business because of the value of the search default. Cloud isn't search or advertising? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1667.8s)]
*  That's got to be figured out. I don't know the answer to that. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1675.08s)]
*  Yeah. So I mean, I guess it's a negotiation now. Maybe they put up one or two to be spun out and [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1678.04s)]
*  then the negotiation happens. And who knows? You could have regime change in Washington. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1682.2s)]
*  Okay, let's keep moving through this incredibly juicy docket. Starbucks CEO is out after a year [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1686.76s)]
*  and a half of underperformance. Star B's CEO, Laxman Narisham, stepped down after just 16 months on the [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1692.8400000000001s)]
*  job. I'll break down what went wrong and get your reaction to all this. I know you have some strong [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1699.88s)]
*  feelings on it. Freeberg as well. Earlier this week, Starbucks shares were down 20% year to date [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1703.72s)]
*  compared to the S&P up 12%. Companies are two straight quarters of declining revenue, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1708.92s)]
*  the definition of a recession. In fact, they've had to raise prices massively due to inflation [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1713.48s)]
*  that has annoyed customers. And customers have been irate about the weight, which has been caused [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1718.28s)]
*  by two things. One, they have a broken staffing algorithm that's led to massive understaffing. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1724.84s)]
*  And then the app has become the Star B's app is incredibly complex and you can order ridiculous [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1729.56s)]
*  drinks. That's causing a massive- Why do you keep saying Star B's? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1735.72s)]
*  It's what the kids call it. It's what the kids call it. Star B's. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1740.28s)]
*  That's part of the problem. Okay. Kids are addicted to this. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1742.68s)]
*  That's what kids call it? Kids are addicted to it. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1746.04s)]
*  Yeah. And they've added all these fruity drinks and stuff that would be along the [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1747.72s)]
*  boba lines that have become incredibly popular with millennials and Gen Z. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1752.44s)]
*  So anyway, Laxman was the handpicked successor by Howard Schultz. And Schultz helped prep and [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1757.88s)]
*  train Laxman, but he's been super critical of him recently. Kind of like the Bob Iger, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1764.1200000000001s)]

*  Chipotle. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1793.48s)]
*  The CEO of Chipotle. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1793.88s)]
*  Chipotle. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1795.08s)]
*  Please. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1795.72s)]
*  Actually, who knows? I don't need it this place. Anyway, Starbucks jumped 25% on Tuesday, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1796.28s)]
*  largest increase, yada yada. Meanwhile, Chipotle dropped 8%. Nicol is on a heater. When he switches [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1802.2s)]
*  teams, the odds go with him. And Starbucks has a bunch of activist investors who are winning [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1808.92s)]
*  massively as part of putting pressure on this freeberg. Starbucks and Nike, both iconic global [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1814.92s)]
*  brands, both have faltered. What's your take? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1819.96s)]
*  Well, the one argument is there's a founder-led problem here, which is when the founder steps [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1823.64s)]
*  out and professional management takes over and you have the same expectations that you had when [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1828.84s)]
*  the founder was leading, things go sideways. But Starbucks faces many more kind of macro economic [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1833.72s)]
*  challenges. Nick, if you pull up Starbucks financial report, so here you can see that their [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1841.64s)]
*  net revenue growth was only a 1% year over year, but their operating margin has been on the [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1847.16s)]
*  decline. So they have not really been able to boost their operating margin very much in the [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1853.0s)]
*  past five years. So while they've raised prices, they've had a really hard time making more money. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1856.68s)]
*  And that's because the cost of food and the cost of labor and the cost of rent and the capital [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1863.48s)]
*  expenditures needed to upgrade stores has far exceeded the ability for them to grow revenue [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1868.52s)]
*  and compete. And now revenue is flatlining because consumers are getting tapped out with respect to [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1874.92s)]
*  how much they can spend. And there's only so much innovation you can really do to charge more, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1880.12s)]
*  get people to come in the store more and drive up revenue. Brian Nickle has an incredible reputation. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1885.3999999999999s)]
*  Prior to Chipotle, he ran Taco Bell and he ran Taco Bell for several years and made it one of the [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1892.76s)]
*  most profitable QSR or quick serve restaurants in the world. He did this by focusing on every Nickle. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1898.76s)]
*  He is notorious for being a cost cutter, for being an efficiency driver, for being a productivity [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1905.72s)]
*  hound. He goes into the business and he figures out every step in the supply chain, every step of [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1911.64s)]
*  the operating activities of the employees in the stores and figures out ways to make sure. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1916.28s)]
*  Did you say that Brian Nickle focuses on every Nickle? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1921.48s)]
*  Don't interrupt him. He doesn't like to be interrupted. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1929.72s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, it's good. And so he was recruited heavily. I don't know if you guys remember, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1932.6s)]
*  Chipotle's founder was running Chipotle. And at the time, there was a lot of investor activism [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1938.9199999999998s)]
*  around Chipotle because they were wasting money like no one's business. The guy had a private jet. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1943.48s)]
*  He was flying his management team back and forth between Denver and New York. They were spending [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1947.9599999999998s)]
*  money on crazy projects. And the board fired the CEO, founder of Chipotle, brought in Nickle. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1952.52s)]
*  Nickle came in and made Chipotle an incredibly profitable growing business. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1958.4399999999998s)]
*  And the expectation is he'll come in and do the same here, that maybe over the years, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1962.12s)]
*  Starbucks' success has bred laziness. Starbucks' success has bred fat slowness, productivity [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1965.6399999999999s)]
*  decline, and that this guy is the right guy to come in and find all the Nickles. And Brian Nickle [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1974.28s)]
*  is probably the right guy, which is why you're seeing the stock rally as hard as it has. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1979.7199999999998s)]
*  Zach, so Tramop, anybody have strong feelings here? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1983.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I would just add something here, which is I do think that macroeconomic forces played a [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1986.2s)]
*  huge role here. We've seen that we have had tremendous amount of inflation over the last [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1990.92s)]
*  few years and Starbucks has gotten more expensive. And if you're a worker whose wages have not kept [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=1995.0s)]
*  up with inflation, do you really want to spend 10, 15 bucks on a cup of coffee that, I mean, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2000.44s)]
*  it's a pretty fancy cup of coffee. I'm not saying it's not, but when you could just go to your [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2007.0800000000002s)]
*  commissary at work and pour yourself a cup of coffee for free, do you really want to work roughly [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2011.64s)]
*  an hour every day to pay for your coffee fix? And I think more and more consumers are just saying [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2016.8400000000001s)]
*  that this is a luxury good. I'm looking at cut costs. When I go to the grocery store and buy [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2022.76s)]
*  groceries, they're 30% more expensive than they were a few years ago. I got to cut somewhere [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2028.2s)]
*  and a luxury cup of coffee just seems like a really easy place to cut. So I think that's a [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2033.88s)]
*  huge part of this. And I don't know how Brian Nichols is going to fix that. It's a macroeconomic [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2038.68s)]
*  force. I have a couple. The first is that I think Starbucks is actually an incredible brand. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2042.44s)]
*  And it's actually a really good business. And the mistakes here have nothing to do [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2049.64s)]
*  with the product per se, meaning Chipotle, if you remember, someone got poisoned there. There was [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2056.92s)]
*  like botulism, the chicken was bad. So there was a core product problem, but that's not the case here. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2063.08s)]
*  If you unpack what Starbucks is, I think that they are a premium product. And [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2071.08s)]
*  that's reinforced by what Saks said, which is they price in such a way because they believe [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2078.44s)]
*  that they are a premium product. The problem is they are not a premium brand. And the difference [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2084.12s)]
*  is Hermes, as an example, is a premium brand. They can charge whatever they want under all [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2090.44s)]
*  weather conditions. They have pricing power. So if their inputs go up, they can make sure they [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2096.44s)]
*  maintain margin by changing the final price that the customer paid. Starbucks doesn't have that [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2102.44s)]
*  power. So they charge like a premium product, but they're not a premium brand that has pricing [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2107.7200000000003s)]
*  power. And that's why you've seen this compression. So very specifically, when the new CEO came in, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2113.4s)]
*  he, I think, made one important mistake, which is he came in on the heels of a very [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2121.4s)]
*  rosy set of projections that Howard Schultz and the board put out to the street. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2129.0s)]
*  And I think that he had an opportunity then and there to just cut it because they saw inflation, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2133.88s)]
*  they saw what it was doing. And if you just looked around the corner, you would have seen [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2140.6s)]
*  that there would have been this compression in the product. And I think what he should have done [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2145.64s)]
*  is just cut the analyst projections and the forecast to give him room and time. He didn't [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2150.36s)]
*  do that. And by the way, when you bring in somebody who ran Taco Bell, that is proving that this is [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2156.44s)]
*  neither a premium product nor a premium brand anymore. It is a mass market product that will [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2163.88s)]
*  ebb and flow cyclically with the vicissitudes of inflation. That doesn't mean it's a bad business. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2169.32s)]
*  I'm just saying it's just an observation. I expect that Brian Nicol, if he is smart, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2175.0s)]
*  will look at this forecast and shred it to give himself time. So that's the short-term thing. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2181.8s)]
*  The long-term thing, though, is in the following image, which I just sent to Nick. I think there's [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2190.68s)]
*  a real question mark on this company over the medium to long-term. And I think it's best [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2196.2s)]
*  represented in this graphic. Starbucks is a sugar company. So for example, a caramel macchiato, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2201.88s)]
*  32 grams of sugar, a mocha frappuccino, 60 grams of sugar. This is three times what you're supposed [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2209.08s)]
*  to have as a human in a day. A frappuccino, 53 grams of sugar, a caramel ribbon, French frappuccino, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2216.36s)]
*  62 grams of sugar. And these products also average four to 500 calories per drink. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2223.6400000000003s)]
*  So the real issue is that more consumers, as they question the repercussions of consuming a lot of [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2231.2400000000002s)]
*  sugar, what will they do? As more consumers get on GLP-1s, what will they do? As more people think [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2239.6400000000003s)]
*  about the fact that fat was never an enemy. In fact, fats are actually really good for you. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2247.2400000000002s)]
*  The problem was that the sugar lobby convinced us that fat was bad and sugar was okay. What will [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2252.92s)]
*  consumers do? And I think that's a really big strategic question mark because the company has [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2259.16s)]
*  to embrace where the world is going. The world is going away from sugar. And I think if consumers [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2264.52s)]
*  become smarter, they're going to have to really figure out what to do. Could Starbucks introduce [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2271.88s)]
*  a line of low calorie drinks that use sugar substitutes to achieve the same flavor? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2277.3199999999997s)]
*  They've done it, but it didn't have uptake. They've already got that, yeah. When you open the app, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2282.2799999999997s)]
*  they have every single syrup comes in sugar-free and regular. So when I go there, now that I'm on [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2286.36s)]
*  GLP-1s and I've lost all this weight and I drink less, I just get the Nitro Cold Brew. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2292.92s)]
*  It's got zero calories or five calories. I may throw a little cold foam on it. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2297.0s)]
*  And then my kids- That's not what the kids want. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2300.92s)]
*  That's not what the kids want. No, I know. And with the kids, it's critical. What I do with [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2303.0800000000004s)]
*  my kids is I do low sweet or like one third sweet. I order one giant one. I pour it into three [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2306.0400000000004s)]
*  glasses at home with ice and I cut it with water because it is like drinking an unbelievable [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2312.6s)]
*  amount of sugar. It is nuts. I'm going to go get an espresso after this. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2320.12s)]
*  This is making me want an espresso. No, I mean, that's the thing about coffee. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2325.4s)]
*  It's coffee supposed to have zero calories and you put a little half and half in it and you get [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2327.16s)]
*  the fat and you're good. No, but I mean, here's what happened. The thing about Starbucks, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2330.12s)]
*  I study Starbucks and I've spent some time with Howard Schultz actually a couple years ago. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2333.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, you did retail, right? Maybe you could talk about your eats experience. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2337.0s)]
*  I did a little retail. You did a little retail side quest. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2338.92s)]
*  The thing about Starbucks is they realized early on that when you can [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2342.3599999999997s)]
*  customize a consumer experience, the consumer comes back more frequently. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2346.4399999999996s)]
*  So when you see your name written on that cup, you feel like you're getting your product. You're [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2350.2s)]
*  not buying an off the shelf product. You're getting a custom personalized experience. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2354.8399999999997s)]
*  What that led to is people customizing their drinks. And what did they find that they like [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2358.7599999999998s)]
*  when they customize their drinks? Sugary sweet atoms. And then that became more and more of the [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2363.08s)]
*  standard menu. And then that just kept evolving. And that's just the consumer feedback mechanism [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2367.48s)]
*  working, which is to Chumoff's point led to 60 grams sugar drinks that are now the standard [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2371.8s)]
*  product at Starbucks, not an espresso or a cappuccino, which is how they started. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2377.5600000000004s)]
*  And it's really unfortunate. I don't think that Brian Nichols is going to focus on that, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2382.1200000000003s)]
*  to be honest, given his background with Taco Bell and Chipotle that there was never anything. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2386.28s)]
*  And to your point, he'll be able to plug the leaks. My question is just more, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2390.28s)]
*  what does a company that's selling a product that people are learning is worse and worse for them? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2395.6400000000003s)]
*  What do they do? They have to embrace a different alternative. But I think it can be very hard [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2401.48s)]
*  because it may be so disruptive to the core product that they sell. Yeah. What do you think? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2407.32s)]
*  I mean, what do you think about this guy? I mean, I and my kids love Starbucks. We are regular [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2413.0s)]
*  consumers. The app is extraordinary. And I think the key issue here, you know, is obviously the [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2418.04s)]
*  inputs and inflation. That's a major driver. But wage inflation is a critical piece of this. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2424.52s)]
*  Here's a chart for you, you know, just in terms of weekly earnings of full-time workers since Q4 [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2430.44s)]
*  2019. Starbucks started having a lot of labor movements, a lot of unionization, a lot of [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2435.08s)]
*  complaints from the Green Aprons, and they have massively raised salaries. They were at, you know, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2440.8399999999997s)]
*  $15, $16, $17. A lot of people were going into gig work, door dashing, you know, Uber. And so [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2446.52s)]
*  this competition for entry-rung employees forced Starbucks. And I know this from the Uber experience [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2453.64s)]
*  and then Door Dash. People wanted to set their own schedules, not be like in a shift work. And so [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2460.04s)]
*  you could make 20 bucks working for Uber and Door Dash. You're making 15 and you have to drag [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2466.92s)]
*  your ass into Starbucks at 5, 6, 7 a.m. and work a shift and not be able to pick up your kids. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2471.72s)]
*  That led them to go to like $20, $22 per hour for these baristas. And they continue to raise those [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2476.8399999999997s)]
*  rates. They've been very generous with employees. And so I think that's a key piece of it. I think [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2484.9199999999996s)]
*  the big story here is going to be automation. I think you're going to see a lot more robotics [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2490.7599999999998s)]
*  in these. If you look at, I just had the CEO of, what's the salad company? Sweet Greens. I just had [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2495.64s)]
*  the CEO of Sweet Greens on this week in startups and he is all in on automation and they are making [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2503.16s)]
*  salad robots and they've already got two or three stores with them. And his whole concept is this [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2508.04s)]
*  going to take $3 out of every salad. We have an investment in a company called Cafe X. Nick, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2512.2s)]
*  you can play a clip of it. These two machines in FSO have broke a million dollars a year in revenue. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2516.6s)]
*  They are serving a massive number of them and they've sold a dozen of these to other people. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2521.7999999999997s)]
*  So I think automation is what's going to come to this. I don't think you can sustain it. And [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2526.04s)]
*  the money has to come out of somewhere. And the two big costs it can come out of is the real estate [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2530.52s)]
*  and the employees. And I think that's what we're going to see in the very near future is Duncan. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2535.08s)]
*  I will predict. Yeah. No, I'll predict this. You were doing it at Eatsa, right? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2540.84s)]
*  Yeah, we had automation. I actually worked on an automation project with Jonathan at Sweet Green [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2544.6s)]
*  and Starbucks and Chipotle. So I knew them all. Yeah. And then the Chipotle CEO got fired. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2549.72s)]
*  We were going to roll out automation with Chipotle and he got fired and Nickel came in and our deal [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2554.28s)]
*  blew up. It killed the deal. So that's how I heard it. Explain how that might work and impact [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2559.56s)]
*  a business like that. Unpack it for a second. Oh my God. So it was going to take out, basically [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2563.88s)]
*  these businesses today are running at call it 30% EBITDA margins at peak performance. That's like [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2568.84s)]
*  Chipotle's best class. By taking out labor, you could probably take out another 20 points of cost, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2573.96s)]
*  which could translate into lower prices for consumers, higher throughput, lower wait times. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2579.64s)]
*  All of these kind of experiential differentiators are going to be significant. Certainly true for [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2584.68s)]
*  Starbucks, certainly true for Sweet Green. I would expect that with Nickel coming in, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2589.24s)]
*  you'll see some experimental stores. As you point out, J Cal, that'll be more highly automated, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2593.8799999999997s)]
*  but we'll also, I think one of the first things you're going to see from Nickel within the first [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2598.7599999999998s)]
*  year at Starbucks is a reduction in the complexity of the menu. This is something he's done [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2602.12s)]
*  historically. And he focuses, like he did at Taco Bell, he creates a couple of key highlight products [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2607.0s)]
*  and creates these innovative product ideas. And then those become the banners that bring people [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2612.52s)]
*  into the store, but it's a simpler menu with kind of more attractive, interesting products [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2616.6s)]
*  that bring people in. And then if you couple automation to reduce some of the cost, you can [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2621.16s)]
*  bring that labor cost down. So yeah, and this is a key point. You know, the order complexity is [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2624.92s)]
*  what's killing the baristas. There's four quintillion ordering options at Starbucks today. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2629.88s)]
*  And so the expectation has always been that that is what brings people coming back to the store. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2636.92s)]
*  But what Nickel has shown in the past with Chipotle and with Taco Bell is you can actually have [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2642.68s)]
*  a simpler menu with a few points of customization. You don't need to have [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2646.8399999999997s)]
*  infinite customization around everything. And my guess is you'll kind of- [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2650.36s)]
*  Which is what Steve Jobs did, right? With his four quadrants when he took back over. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2653.0s)]
*  He was like, listen, what's business? What's consumer? What's high-end? What's low? What's [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2656.68s)]
*  portable? What's desktop? I forgot what the four quadrants were, but he did it. And if you look, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2660.6s)]
*  Freiburg, to your point of the cost savings, right now, the majority of orders in Starbucks, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2664.68s)]
*  I believe, are coming in through the app. And what I was told, you know, in some of the buzz [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2669.16s)]
*  I heard from baristas was that they are prioritizing mobile orders to punish the people online [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2673.0s)]
*  to get them to download the app. Because that gets rid of cashiers. And McDonald's has no [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2681.0s)]
*  cashiers in a lot of restaurants right now. You just order at a giant touchscreen. So the cashiers [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2686.12s)]
*  will be gone. The cooks will be gone. And eventually the baristas will be gone. And it'll just be a [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2690.04s)]
*  couple of people. The cashier problem also creates a wait time problem because it's a serial ordering [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2693.96s)]
*  process. Everyone stands in line. They order one at a time. And there's only one. And so the baristas [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2698.84s)]
*  just taking all of these are really good points. I just think that the CEO would not have gotten [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2702.84s)]
*  fired had he just moved the forecast down by 20% when he came to this. Also, did you see this [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2707.8s)]
*  incredible clip of him saying he doesn't want anybody working past six PM? Nick, play this [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2713.1600000000003s)]
*  clip. This is like, Oh, this is the previous Starbucks CEO. I mean, this clip is so brutal. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2717.0s)]
*  We should talk about this in the context of Eric Schmidt's interview as well. Jake, show the clip [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2724.6000000000004s)]
*  and then let's talk. Let's show Eric Schmidt and talk about like work culture in America. I think [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2728.92s)]
*  this is a really important point. Fantastic side quest. Let's do it. All right. So now there's a [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2733.88s)]
*  big culture thing going on here, Freiburg of hard work in corporations. I don't know if you saw Eric [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2738.52s)]
*  Schmidt at Stanford. They took this talk down and Eric Schmidt is walking the comments back. But [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2743.32s)]
*  here we go, folks. This is the money clip from Eric Schmidt. Google decided that work life balance [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2748.6s)]
*  and going home early and working from home was more important than winning. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2754.52s)]
*  And the startups, the reason startups work is because the people work like hell. And I'm [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2762.44s)]
*  sorry to be so blunt. But the fact of the matter is if you all leave the university and go found [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2767.64s)]
*  a company, you're not going to let people work from home and only come in one day a week. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2774.2s)]
*  Ooh, your reaction. Can you show the Starbucks clip? Can you show the Starbucks clip? Well, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2779.72s)]
*  that's self-evidently true. I mean, he's basically making a point similar to what I said about [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2783.16s)]
*  Google so large that employees can hide and not do very much and, you know, they can kind of. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2788.12s)]
*  It's not just Google. Oh, it's pervasive. Yeah, let's pull up the the Starbucks CEO. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2794.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm very disciplined about balance. If there's anything after 6 p.m. and if I'm in town, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2801.0s)]
*  it's got to be a pretty high bar to keep me away from the family. Anybody who gets a minute of time [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2806.6s)]
*  after that, better be sure that it's important because if not, it'll just wait for another day. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2811.7200000000003s)]
*  This makes me so uncomfortable just hearing that I feel. Holy ****. I mean, retire, bro. Just retire. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2816.76s)]
*  What does America value is the real question. Does America value success, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2822.76s)]
*  performance, or does America value comfort? And the problem is American work culture has [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2827.2400000000002s)]
*  shifted to valuing comfort, and that is the inevitable outcome of decades of extraordinary [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2833.4s)]
*  success. And now the performance culture is losing to the comfort culture. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2840.12s)]
*  And I think you guys are putting a lot of things together. The problem is that I don't think that [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2846.04s)]
*  that's his truth. Actually, I think that this guy's clip sounds very inauthentic. I think what [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2851.48s)]
*  probably happened is the PR and policy group of Starbucks says, hey, listen, here's the average [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2857.16s)]
*  age of your employee and here's what they value. And he probably spouted some politically correct [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2863.08s)]
*  nonsense to try to inspire the troops. I think a lot of CEOs do this. Like I think we're seeing [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2868.8399999999997s)]
*  in modern media today that a lot of CEOs have actually become the least version of their [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2875.16s)]
*  authentic self. They are being packaged by people to dress and act and say things in a certain way. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2881.48s)]
*  And I think what happens as a result of that is that you have a wayward culture where nobody [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2890.92s)]
*  knows what people stand for. That's when the corrosiveness of folks not working at all or having [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2895.56s)]
*  jobs at two different companies comes in. Like that's a total moral and ethical breach [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2904.68s)]
*  that happens because people think it's acceptable. And I think people think it's acceptable, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2910.2799999999997s)]
*  because it's not in the talking points of how the CEOs are trying to package themselves to [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2916.2s)]
*  tens of thousands of employees. So you think this was a PR design genuflect. I like that insight. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2922.04s)]
*  Sax, your thoughts overall? Well, it could be a genuflect. I don't know. Look, I would say that [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2928.52s)]
*  there are a lot of Americans who do feel that way about work, but I think it's not appropriate [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2935.48s)]
*  in two cases. Number one is if you're ambitious and you really want to rise in your organization, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2941.96s)]
*  then you got to have more of the J-Cal attitude, which is I'm going to be the first to work and [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2949.64s)]
*  the last one to leave and I'm going to show my boss, I'm going to get promoted. So if you want [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2953.2400000000002s)]
*  to be ambitious in your career, that's not a good attitude to have. And then on the other extreme, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2956.84s)]
*  if you're the CEO of the company, your attitude has got to be, I'm 24 seven with this shit. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2962.12s)]
*  It's like, I'm always online. I'm always reachable. The buck stops with me. Now, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2967.0s)]
*  obviously you're going to cut out time to be protected that you can spend with your family, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2971.7999999999997s)]
*  but your attitude's always got to be that I'm available. I don't turn off my phone. I don't [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2977.0s)]
*  do any of that stuff. I just think that if you're running an organization, you can't take this [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2982.04s)]
*  attitude that, oh, it's 6 PM. I'm switched off. It just doesn't work that way. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2987.0s)]
*  Yeah. Especially if you're running one of them. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2992.28s)]
*  I don't think that's... Yeah. I mean, I just know there's an appropriate thing for someone [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2993.72s)]
*  like that to say when he's the CEO of a multinational corporation. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=2997.88s)]
*  Yeah. I think that is the key insight, Saxon, with you on this, which is leadership starts at the top. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3001.32s)]
*  If the leader says, hey, listen, don't bother me after six, I'll talk to you at 9 AM, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3007.4s)]
*  then that's just going to go through the entire organization. And it's already hard enough to run [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3011.56s)]
*  these organizations. Now, if you run a lifestyle business as your local cafe, and you want to do [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3016.44s)]
*  that and you're running it at a break even, that's fine. This is a publicly traded company with [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3021.7200000000003s)]
*  shareholders with massive competition. Who could get taken out by all these other brands that are [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3025.16s)]
*  trying to compete with it? You have to have... This is a war. We are at war. We have to figure [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3030.28s)]
*  out how to lower prices. We need to grind every nickel from the supply chain, rent. We have to [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3035.64s)]
*  renegotiate contracts. And then just to speak on the work ethic issue, this country is in a very [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3041.0s)]
*  significant war about going back to work and work ethic. You mentioned over employed and the ethics [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3049.88s)]
*  around that, Chamath. And then there's a group of Americans, and I've been studying this a bit, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3054.76s)]
*  that are opting out of capitalism or hacking capitalism. There's a very interesting movement. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3060.6s)]
*  It's called FIRE, Financial Independence Retire Early. And if you look at the two subreddits, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3064.68s)]
*  over employed and the FIRE subreddit, young people are saying capitalism is there to be hacked. And [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3069.88s)]
*  my way of hacking it is I'm going to have two jobs. And I had a startup come to me and say, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3076.6s)]
*  we've got this great engineer, literally from Google, who wants to work from us. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3080.12s)]
*  And he's making 400K. We can get him for a buck 50. And I said, oh, wow, that's great. Why would [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3084.2000000000003s)]
*  he do that? Is he independently wealthy? They said, no, he's keeping his job at Google. He says it [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3088.84s)]
*  takes 10, 20 hours a week, and he's going to work 60 hours a week for us. And I said, is that ethical [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3092.52s)]
*  or legal? And they're like, I don't know. That's why we're asking you. These are 20 year old [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3097.96s)]
*  founders we had backed. And I was like, this is incredibly unethical, and you're going to get us [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3101.88s)]
*  in a lawsuit. Don't do it. But that is what's, you know, the give and take. And if you look at [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3105.08s)]
*  what happened with Dell this past six months, have you been following that free break the Dell story? [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3109.88s)]
*  No, it's pretty incredible. They told everybody we're coming back to office. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3114.12s)]
*  People were like, I don't want to come back to office. Okay, reasonable. You think you do a [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3118.44s)]
*  better job at home. I get it. What they said was, if you want to be work from home, you can't get a [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3121.2400000000002s)]
*  promotion and you can't get a salary increase. And you know what employees said? Okay, I don't [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3125.64s)]
*  want an increase. I don't I if my choice is stay at home and have no salaries, and I don't care [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3131.0s)]
*  about a raise. I don't care about a promotion. Then they said, you know what, we're cutting 12,000 [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3136.12s)]
*  people. You have to come back to office. Jay Penske and his company told everybody have to come back [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3140.7599999999998s)]
*  to office. So now that you know, you have this era of being fit, and you don't need as many people [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3145.8799999999997s)]
*  from AI, I think everybody's coming back to the office, unless you are part of the 20% of truly [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3151.16s)]
*  elite workers. Thanks for coming to my TED talk. Even then, though, I, I struggle to understand why [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3157.56s)]
*  anybody who has any ambition would think that they're going to achieve the same amount of stuff, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3163.96s)]
*  working by themselves, then they will by working with a group of colleagues that you respect [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3171.72s)]
*  in a physical space together. Well, influence our culture. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3177.4s)]
*  But I'm saying like, when you when you look at the great things that the world needs, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3181.0800000000004s)]
*  that we are building and should be building, I don't see many good examples where those things [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3186.36s)]
*  are done in a remote way. I see an necessity of people to be together, whether it's to design [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3193.0800000000004s)]
*  something together, to talk about something together, to debate something together, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3200.1200000000003s)]
*  to learn from each other, to grow as a person. And you're robbing yourself of all of that. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3204.36s)]
*  And so I just think that it is a short term optimization that a lot of people will regret, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3212.04s)]
*  not necessarily in the moment. But when their career doesn't go where they want to, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3217.48s)]
*  or the company they work at doesn't go where it should go to, or is capable of going to, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3222.04s)]
*  they'll start to look for a scapegoat. But the real reason is that they've abandoned the idea [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3227.72s)]
*  that they need to be together. And I just think that that's that's a tragedy. And it turns out, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3234.7599999999998s)]
*  the best of our companies, like when I rank my portfolio, the ones that are doing the best [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3241.3999999999996s)]
*  are in total different industries. But the single consistent theme is we are all back together in [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3248.2799999999997s)]
*  person. Isn't that interesting? It makes total sense. It's much more productive because I think [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3254.2s)]
*  innovation happens as a team, you need collaboration. And it's way easier to do that when everyone is [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3261.3999999999996s)]
*  together in the same place, there's more room for spontaneity, more spontaneous interactions. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3267.56s)]
*  The reason why Steve Jobs designed the spaceship campus in that famous circle was because it [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3273.08s)]
*  maximized the opportunity for serendipity. Right? Like there's no, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3280.84s)]
*  Bell Labs did the same thing. Bell Labs had a quad that you had to walk through to go from meeting [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3283.96s)]
*  to meeting. So everyone interacted intersecting. The technical term for that is collisions. And [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3288.52s)]
*  there's been a lot of research on random collisions. And I agree wholeheartedly with it. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3293.48s)]
*  Yeah. And look, I just want to underscore this point. I think there's nothing wrong. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3298.1200000000003s)]
*  If somebody says, look, my family's most important thing in my life, I only want to work [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3302.44s)]
*  40 hours a week. I'm going to do a nine to six job with an hour lunch break. That's 40 hours. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3307.0s)]
*  Don't call me after 6 PM. You can design your career that way, but that is not a career that's [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3312.12s)]
*  going to enable you to either run a company as a CEO or be a founder of a startup or be on a track [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3318.04s)]
*  to one day being a founder or a CEO. This is not compatible. I mean, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3326.12s)]
*  Or even just a senior executive. Right. Exactly. So you have to decide what [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3330.76s)]
*  track you're going to be on. And I think there's a lot of millennial gen Z types who are confused [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3335.16s)]
*  about this and they have the entitlement of saying, well, I want to just do the 40 hour a [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3339.3199999999997s)]
*  week thing. But then I also expect to rise rapidly and be an executive and be a founder or be a, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3343.7999999999997s)]
*  you know, a CEO one day. And that's not going to work. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3349.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's not going to work. And, you know, in fairness, I think a lot of young people have not [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3352.8399999999997s)]
*  been mentored because they came up in the COVID generation and we're now four years later and they [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3358.12s)]
*  just haven't had the chance to be mentored or be in a, in an office. And a lot of senior executives [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3362.84s)]
*  and CEOs are not coming to the office. You know, a part of my move to Austin is I'm building a [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3367.0s)]
*  theater to record the podcast in, and I'm building an incubator space and we're moving back to in [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3373.4s)]
*  person. I grandfathered the existing employees and I'm only hiring people in person now, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3378.44s)]
*  because I feel something very big has been lost in terms of meeting with founders in person and [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3382.6800000000003s)]
*  young people seeing me interact and my other senior team members with those founders in person [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3388.44s)]
*  during a pitch meeting, during a product jam session, during a fundraising review. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3393.32s)]
*  Good, can I just say something about mentoring? I also think mentoring can be described as capital [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3398.6s)]
*  M mentoring and small M mentoring. Capital M is where some person is assigned to you [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3405.1600000000003s)]
*  and they're going to imbue some magical phrase or saying or thing. And all of a sudden [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3412.28s)]
*  everything is going to work out for you. That form of capital M mentoring doesn't exist [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3418.2s)]
*  and has never worked for those that have tried it. The thing that's really productive is small [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3425.64s)]
*  and mentoring. And that happens when you model behaviors of really smart people [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3430.68s)]
*  and really capable people, really ethical people. And again, that happens because you're seeing them [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3436.2s)]
*  on a day to day basis, not just in a meeting, but in the gaps between meetings. And they'll [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3441.56s)]
*  include you in certain things or you'll have lunch with them. And this is what I mean by [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3449.08s)]
*  all of these people that are looking for an accelerant in their career. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3453.72s)]
*  They've robbed themselves of the most powerful accelerant possible, which is [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3459.48s)]
*  capable people to surround themselves with. Yeah, I think it's so well said. They are going to look [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3465.48s)]
*  back on these decisions and they're going to agree 100%. And my one of my first jobs working [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3470.68s)]
*  at land systems, my mentor Mike Savino was always working late. He was trying to move up in the [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3477.3199999999997s)]
*  organization and I wouldn't leave before he left. And then he would walk by and he'd say, it was in [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3481.48s)]
*  New York City. Hey, what are you working on? I'm so I'm reading these Novell networking books. I'm [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3486.44s)]
*  trying to get my certification. I'm trying to learn more. I want to get out of hardware and get [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3490.6s)]
*  into software. And he'd say, Oh, I'm going to get some dinner. You want to come? Now he was four [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3493.7999999999997s)]
*  levels above me in the organization. I was the lowest. He was second to the highest. And then I [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3498.76s)]
*  got to go to dinner with him. And then I got to hear about all the big clients. I got to hear how, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3502.92s)]
*  you know, they were doing the pitches and then he started including me in pitches. And all of a sudden [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3507.96s)]
*  I went from four degrees from him to reporting into him. And that's how I learned, you know, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3512.28s)]
*  look at the person on the left, look at the person. I was, I don't think I was actually, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3517.6400000000003s)]
*  I was a certified network engineer. I was, I was a certified Novell engineer as well. I got, [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3523.88s)]
*  I did it when I was like 16. Shout out Eric Schmidt. Yeah. I mean, if you had that in the [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3528.36s)]
*  nineties, you could make, you know, 50, 75, a hundred K. Well, the person that helped me [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3534.52s)]
*  little and mentored me, he's like, listen, man, I'm not going to tell you how to do pitches or [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3540.6000000000004s)]
*  whatever, but I'm going to teach you how to install this. I'm going to teach you how to manage it. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3545.0800000000004s)]
*  And that was mentoring and that was really valuable. And I sat beside this guy. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3549.32s)]
*  Absolutely. And if you want to be a freelancer, be a freelancer. Okay. Let's go to our little [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3554.6s)]
*  election update and some news about Kamala and a little bit of socialism coming. So here's how I [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3562.68s)]
*  set it up today. We'll see how this goes. 2024 election update is here. I'm going to do two [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3570.2s)]
*  things. Gentlemen, I'm going to just tee up the latest polls. And then I asked our crack all in [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3575.16s)]
*  research team to just give me the top, you know, a couple of issues in the principles own words, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3579.72s)]
*  the principles being, you know, the press on either side and the four people who are running [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3586.2s)]
*  for office. So let's just go through the numbers here. Nate Silver, a friend of the pod now has [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3591.3199999999997s)]
*  Kamala Harris at 57% favorite to win the electoral college. There's your first chart. You can compare [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3595.7999999999997s)]
*  this to what happened with Biden before the hot swap. Trump had a 73% probability to win the [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3601.9599999999996s)]
*  electoral college. So that is the swing of all swings. And obviously a lot has happened since [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3609.08s)]
*  then, as well as the assassination attempt on Trump. Massive swing for Harris, as you can see [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3613.08s)]
*  in Nate Silver's chart, he's doing something called silver bulletin. He's not a five 38 anymore, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3619.08s)]
*  but this is the most telling chart. You can see Biden Trump there and it's, it's almost a clean [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3623.4s)]
*  sweep in red. And then you go to Harris Trump and the shift has been a hundred percent blue. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3627.48s)]
*  Pretty dramatic. Harris has flipped according to silver, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3634.2s)]
*  Michigan, Nevada, and Virginia. Here's a couple of quotes and then we'll get into it. The big [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3640.28s)]
*  critique from Republicans this past week is that Harris won't do interviews. God, it's just [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3644.36s)]
*  ridiculous that they have not sat for interviews. And meanwhile, Trump is doing every podcast and, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3649.72s)]
*  and Twitter spaces on the planet. But the big news is that this might have changed by the time [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3655.56s)]
*  you listen to this podcast. Everybody knows we tape on Thursdays for the world's number one [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3661.4s)]
*  podcast. And it comes out on Fridays. Washington post, Jeff Stein reported that Kamala Harris [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3664.6s)]
*  will propose the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging for food, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3670.92s)]
*  encrosures on Friday. We'll get, I'm going to hand that off to you, free bird to detail. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3675.88s)]
*  Oh, I'm going to throw up. Take it easy. Just we're going to get there. You're going to get your, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3680.12s)]
*  you're going to get your rare vegetables in a second. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3685.56s)]
*  So the other, you're going to get your, you're going to get your veggies sashimi. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3687.48s)]
*  All right. From the JD Vance corner, he is questioning Tim Walz's service. Here's the [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3694.92s)]
*  quote. Well, I wonder Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? When was this Harris campaign responding [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3701.72s)]
*  in his 24 years of service, the governor carried fired and trained others to use weapons in war, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3708.44s)]
*  innumerable times, yada, yada, yada, a lot of back and forth there about that issue. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3713.48s)]
*  But let's get to, and it was incredible, two hour spaces, audio is a little rough, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3720.12s)]
*  but the content was great. Elon had a conversation with Trump and they talked about nuclear power. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3727.08s)]
*  Elon offered his services two or three times to Trump. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3733.8s)]
*  Thanks to, uh, do efficiency, uh, in the, uh, government and maybe cut some costs, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3736.28s)]
*  but that's what happened notably in the last week. Freeberg, what's your take on this reported by [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3743.1600000000003s)]
*  the Washington post and I think confirmed by Politico, uh, move by Kamala Harris. Thank you [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3751.0s)]
*  for asking. Thank you for asking. Do you have any feelings on it? Yes. Yeah. I, unequivocally [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3756.28s)]
*  hate socialism. Socialism destroys innovation, destroys productivity and destroys individual [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3762.28s)]
*  liberties. Agriculture and food markets have insanely competitive dynamics because there are [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3770.6800000000003s)]
*  commodity markets. There are tons of competitors. There is no monopoly in making food. There is no [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3777.2400000000002s)]
*  monopoly in making CPG products. There is no monopoly in retail. There is no monopoly in [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3781.8s)]
*  grocery stores. It is a small, small, small, small, small, small, small, small, small, small, small, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3786.1200000000003s)]
*  small margin, highly competitive, highly fragmented free market. And the free market works [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3792.2s)]
*  in that everyone is always competing with each other, creating new productivity improvements. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3798.4399999999996s)]
*  And as a result, over time prices come down except when the government intervenes and gets [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3802.7599999999998s)]
*  involved. So I would argue that the real cause of price inflation in food is not the supposed [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3809.24s)]
*  price gouging by corporate players in the ag and food industry, all of whom are deeply competitive [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3816.52s)]
*  with one another, but rather is the result of the inflation associated with government spending [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3821.72s)]
*  and stimulus coming out of COVID. Nick, exhibit one, the Fed balance sheet. From COVID to today, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3827.7999999999997s)]
*  the Fed balance sheet grew from 4.2 trillion to 7.2 trillion dollars, a growth of 70%. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3835.3999999999996s)]
*  The Federal Reserve went out and they bought assets and they issued debt to banks and introduced [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3842.12s)]
*  liquidity into the system. If you go to the next slide, as a result, the M2 money supply increased [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3848.12s)]
*  from 15 trillion to 21 trillion since COVID, a 40% increase. Okay, so now there is more money in the [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3853.08s)]
*  system. So the cost of everything should go up, which is exactly what we've seen. We can walk [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3860.7599999999998s)]
*  through a couple of the other commodity price charts from the St. Louis Fed. Here is the price [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3865.16s)]
*  of electricity. As an example, the price of electricity has gone up a little bit less than [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3869.96s)]
*  the M2 money supply. But the truth is when you start to actually look at ag commodity prices [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3874.52s)]
*  over time, what's happened is there was certainly a boost coming from COVID, but the competition and [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3879.48s)]
*  the challenges in overproduction in the ag markets has started to hit and started to bring prices [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3884.2s)]
*  back down. So here's the price of strawberries. Strawberries today are selling for less than they [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3889.56s)]
*  were pre-COVID. Potatoes are now back to where they were pre-COVID. Now, let me give you some [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3894.2s)]
*  statistics on some of the supposed price gouging companies in the industry. Kraft Heinz stock [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3900.04s)]
*  pre-COVID was 29 bucks a share. Today, Kraft Heinz stock is 34 bucks a share. 2019 revenue of 25 [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3907.08s)]
*  billion, 2023 revenue of 26 billion. EBITDA on 2019 of 6.1 billion, EBITDA on 2023 of 6.3 billion. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3913.8s)]
*  There's not a lot of profit gouging. In fact, Kraft Heinz has not been able to keep up [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3922.52s)]
*  with the inflation. Starbucks, which we just talked about, their stock was at $90 pre-COVID [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3926.68s)]
*  and today 93 bucks. 2019 revenue of 26 billion, operating income of 4.1 billion, 2023 revenue [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3932.52s)]
*  of 36 billion, but operating income only 5.9. Margins have come down in Starbucks. Nick, if you [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3939.7999999999997s)]
*  pull up the McKinsey chart, this is a study of the grocery industry. The state of grocery in North [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3945.96s)]
*  America, 2023 by McKinsey. Accelerating pressures on profitability to cope with the pandemic's [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3951.08s)]
*  upheaval, grocers have had to dramatically increase capex, increase supplies. As a result, [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3957.4s)]
*  they've seen a significant impact on margins. Here's the margin profile pre-pandemic and today. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3962.92s)]
*  Gross margin has declined by two points from 47.6 to 45.6. EBITDA margin has declined by 1.5 points. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3969.0s)]
*  Now let's just go to the final chart, which is CPG companies, the companies that make food and [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3977.7999999999997s)]
*  sell it to consumers. As you can see, during the COVID era, the three-year rolling TSR has declined [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3981.64s)]
*  since COVID across the board. Food companies are seeing food prices come down. Farmers are really [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3990.68s)]
*  suffering. Labor costs have tripled since the pandemic, but they're still having to sell [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3995.7999999999997s)]
*  products at the same price. CPG companies have lower margins and supermarkets have lower margins. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=3999.7999999999997s)]
*  There is nowhere in the ag or food supply chain that we are seeing fundamentally price gouging [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4006.04s)]
*  or profit taking happening. What has happened is the cost of labor, the cost of moving stuff around, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4011.16s)]
*  the cost of fuel, the cost of electricity, the cost of goods has all risen with inflation because [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4016.68s)]
*  of the increase in the money supply and federal spending and the stimulus associated with the [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4021.88s)]
*  Federal Reserve buying assets onto their balance sheet. Arguably, I would say that trying to step [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4026.92s)]
*  in and cap prices will reduce competition and as a result will reduce investment in improving [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4032.36s)]
*  productivity. We have seen this countless times with every socialist experiment in human history [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4037.4s)]
*  has started with caps on food and it has resulted in bread lines like you see in the image behind me [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4042.6s)]
*  today, as we can see in Soviet Russia. This is a mistake. It is a problem. It is anti-American. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4047.6400000000003s)]
*  It is anti-free market. It is anti-innovation. It's anti-productivity and ultimately it's [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4053.48s)]
*  anti-liberty and I cannot stand it. That's my rant. Okay. Thanks for coming to Freeberg's [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4057.64s)]
*  TED Talk. Chamathya, so you're nodding strongly in agreement. This is just dumb and pandering. Am I [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4063.7999999999997s)]
*  correct? There is no sustainable solution to inflation if you cap what a company can charge [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4068.68s)]
*  because what they'll do is they'll just stop producing. They'll manage to the margin that [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4078.2799999999997s)]
*  they'll just stop and the reason they can stop is that they would rather contract and maintain [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4085.2400000000002s)]
*  their profitability than lose money and then what happens is there's less products in the market [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4090.52s)]
*  and so the prices go up. I think it stands to reason that the Harris campaign has access [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4097.32s)]
*  to some reasonably smart people. They also have access to really smart people like Larry Summers [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4103.08s)]
*  and so I think if they just make a few phone calls, they'll figure out that this is a really [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4110.2s)]
*  terrible idea. Sax, any thoughts? Overall election and this specific issue. You take it either way [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4114.92s)]
*  you like. Yeah, so this story was reported by the Washington Post and by Bloomberg and others so [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4120.92s)]
*  it appears to be more than just a rumor conjecture. I mean these are publications that are apparently [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4128.04s)]
*  well-sourced within the Harris campaign so I think it is fair game for us to comment on this [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4135.08s)]
*  policy proposal that she apparently will be coming out with. Look, I think Freeburg is [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4141.16s)]
*  right about the policy. The idea of price controls is widely discredited across the political [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4147.48s)]
*  spectrum. I mean I think virtually all economists agree on this. This was pride extensively in the [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4153.88s)]
*  1970s not just under Jimmy Carter but Nixon tried wage and price controls and Gerald Ford had this [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4160.28s)]
*  whole program called Whip Inflation Now where they printed out these buttons called these wind [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4167.48s)]
*  buttons and then Carter extended it. That's why we had huge lines of the gas pumps is because we had [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4172.28s)]
*  price controls on gas and those lines of the pump went away almost overnight when [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4178.92s)]
*  Ronald Reagan came in and removed the price caps on gas. So we've tried price controls before, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4183.48s)]
*  it didn't work and it is remarkable that she would be proposing here potentially [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4190.28s)]
*  as her first major policy proposal on the economy to go back to this 1970s era failed policy. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4197.879999999999s)]
*  And I think it's really tipping her hand in terms of where her economic proposals are going to come [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4205.639999999999s)]
*  from and what she really thinks. Keep in mind that throughout the Biden presidency, he rhetorically [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4211.8s)]
*  would blame corporate greed for the rise in inflation we saw as like a scapegoat because [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4219.56s)]
*  he didn't want to blame himself for all the spending. But she's going further now and actually [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4224.52s)]
*  instituting this as policy. Yeah and so just to be clear with everybody, [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4229.4800000000005s)]
*  we don't have the actual policy here but it's been reported. Seems like it's true, maybe it's not, [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4233.24s)]
*  maybe they stepped it back. We don't know the details of this at all but we do know it's been [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4238.6s)]
*  tried before. What we do know is there are times when you could like in an economic emergency like [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4243.240000000001s)]
*  during what was the giant hurricane or wars, you know you can keep your eye on this. But the truth [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4250.04s)]
*  is as we just talked about with Starbucks, you know, Sachs is like I got a free cup of coffee [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4257.400000000001s)]
*  or close to free. I make my own cold brew, shout out Cafe Dumont because I don't want to pay [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4262.76s)]
*  eight dollars for it. The market responds and when you put your thumb on capitalism, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4268.44s)]
*  you put 12 thumbs on capitalism and on the scale, all kinds of weird behaviors occur. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4272.759999999999s)]
*  It does not work and consumers can just simply opt out. They can make breakfast at home, they [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4277.96s)]
*  can brown bag their lunch and it's a great point. Then companies are going to be like holy s***. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4283.24s)]
*  People are not buying eight dollar coffees. Let's make a cheaper happy meal. To support your point [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4289.4s)]
*  and what Chamath was messaging on our chat, look at Walmart. Stocks up 7% today because they offer [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4294.6s)]
*  lower priced solutions to consumers and Dollar General and Dollar Tree are rallying as well. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4300.84s)]
*  When the market competes, consumers benefit and there are companies that will win and the companies [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4306.52s)]
*  that try to price gouge and the companies that try to charge too much will lose. Starbucks has [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4312.280000000001s)]
*  been trying to charge too much for sugar water. They have a real problem they are now tackling. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4317.160000000001s)]
*  Walmart is trying to bring value to consumers. They are winning. That is how free markets work. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4322.68s)]
*  When the government steps in and says here's how much margin you can make or here's how much [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4327.96s)]
*  prices should be, it ruins everything and the entire incentive structure goes away and you end [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4331.16s)]
*  up with bread lines. Saxie Poo, what do you got? Well, there was a really interesting story in the [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4337.0s)]
*  Wall Street Journal this week called Kamala Harris's economic team and agenda start to take [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4342.68s)]
*  shape. It was interesting because it said here in the first paragraph that the challenge of her [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4347.56s)]
*  economics team is, quote, differentiating the candidate, which is Harris, from her unpopular [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4354.120000000001s)]
*  boss, which is Biden, without abandoning his policies. The problem that they have is that [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4360.04s)]
*  for the last three and a half years, there has been no daylight between Harris and Biden and in [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4366.68s)]
*  fact, Corinne Jean-Pierre said exactly that in the article. There's been no daylight. They've been [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4371.64s)]
*  highly aligned. Now, in response to that, what the campaign has been trying to do is A, not say [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4375.88s)]
*  anything about policy, just try to redefine the candidate based on biography. She's done [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4382.2s)]
*  no interviews with the media. She's done no unscripted speaking appearances and the media [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4386.68s)]
*  has cooperated with this so far. The most egregious example was that Time magazine cover story, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4393.56s)]
*  which was this really gauzy profile that was hagiography, even though she refused to even do [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4399.16s)]
*  an interview with Time magazine in that story. Strategy number one has been just to kind of [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4405.24s)]
*  hide from the media in terms of what she would really do. Strategy number two was [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4410.92s)]
*  adopting some of Donald Trump's most popular policies. She just announced no tax on tips. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4415.8s)]
*  She was, I think, widely criticized for being a copycat on that. Now, we finally have strategy [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4421.0s)]
*  number three, which is to tiptoe into the campaign with her own original proposal on price controls, [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4426.679999999999s)]
*  which I think is being roundly criticized, but it shows where her policy instincts are coming from. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4433.56s)]
*  This is somebody who has always been on the progressive left when she was a member of the [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4439.320000000001s)]
*  Senate. GovTrack rated her as the most liberal member of the Senate, even to the left of Bernie [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4443.240000000001s)]
*  Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. You're now seeing this come out in her policy proposals. Look, [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4450.120000000001s)]
*  I think she's definitely gotten a bounce in the polls over the last few weeks because of this [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4455.8s)]
*  favorable media coverage, but it's a sugar high based on something that's not substantive. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4459.96s)]
*  I mean, she didn't put forward any proposals, and I think that now that she finally is putting out [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4465.08s)]
*  policy proposals that can be questioned or analyzed and criticized, I think this is going [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4469.96s)]
*  to be the beginning of, I would say, a big correction in her campaign. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4475.08s)]
*  Soterios Johnson J. Cal, do you agree? Do you think her strategy is off at this point, and [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4479.56s)]
*  is it starting to hurt her to put out these proposals? [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4484.6s)]
*  I remain undecided, moderate, left-winging moderate. I've voted Republican 35% of the time, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4487.24s)]
*  Democrat 65% of the time, and I've been studying the strategy here. Her strategy is crushing Trump, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4493.96s)]
*  so obviously it's working. Now, I don't like it. I think everybody should be doing debates. I was [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4499.4800000000005s)]
*  really upset that there wasn't a debate or a speed run primary. I don't like the fact that Trump and [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4505.400000000001s)]
*  Biden skipped out on the primary debates. I think they should be forced to do debates, forced to do [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4510.52s)]
*  interviews. And so, on that front, I hate what this is doing to democracy. Now, pragmatically, [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4514.68s)]
*  running out the clock as a strategy and not defining your positions too much and just [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4524.76s)]
*  selling the vibes is a brilliant strategy, and it's working. And as Trump said, the VPs don't [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4531.96s)]
*  matter. What she did as VP doesn't really matter. What JD Vance thinks as VP doesn't matter. VPs [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4538.76s)]
*  don't matter. You're voting for the president. The VPs get in line. Trump's positions, JD Vance [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4543.8s)]
*  flipped a bunch of his positions to align with Trump, and I think Kamala did the same when she [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4549.96s)]
*  worked with Biden. That's your job, is to align with the president. Now that she's her own, and [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4554.360000000001s)]
*  Waltz is going to flip to her. So, I think they're putting out moderate vibes. I think they're kind [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4559.08s)]
*  of socialists. I think they're not as socialist as Bernie and Elizabeth Warren, but they're not [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4563.72s)]
*  moderates. But they're pretending to be moderates, and that is working as a strategy. They are [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4569.08s)]
*  demolishing Trump, and then Trump is getting bad advice around him, I think. If I were to [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4574.28s)]
*  handicap this and I wrap up, it would be just one more minute. I think Trump was so good on all end. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4579.72s)]
*  He was so good at the RNC for the first half of his speech. When he is presidential, when he has [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4584.76s)]
*  a big open tent, I love him. I think he's great, and I think he's like world positive. When he [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4590.84s)]
*  goes into grievance culture, when he goes after the race stuff like he did with the black journalists, [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4596.76s)]
*  when he goes after gender or JD does the gender stuff and the cat stuff, I hate that stuff. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4600.92s)]
*  Moderates hates that stuff. Women hate that stuff. And the moderates and the women in the swing [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4605.96s)]
*  states will decide the election, and Trump's campaign is loundering right now. They have to [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4610.360000000001s)]
*  flip it back to that Trump 2.0 I described many times, where he's serious presidential, not bullying [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4616.280000000001s)]
*  people, not doing the incel comic thing, just going after Waltz, going after cat ladies. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4621.96s)]
*  It's just gross and not necessary. So I think maybe Trump after the DNC will go back to Trump [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4626.28s)]
*  2.0. That would be much better, and I think Trump has a chance of winning if he does that. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4633.4s)]
*  If Kamala goes moderate, I think she's going to win. So that's my strategic take. I remain [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4637.719999999999s)]
*  undecided as a voter. But you just said she's a socialist, not a moderate. I think in her heart, [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4643.4s)]
*  she's between like, if you had Clinton, and great question, if you had Clinton and you had Bernie [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4649.16s)]
*  Sanders, I think she kind of falls between the two. But I think she's pretending to be a moderate [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4655.0s)]
*  to get votes. Right. You know, just like Trump will pretend to be super right wing to get the, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4658.6s)]
*  you know, who are acted up, but he's kind of a moderate to socially. I think Trump is a [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4663.16s)]
*  moderate in this race. And she's much more moderate than than she is. I think that actually is true. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4667.56s)]
*  Look, I think that she's pretending to be a lot of things. She's pretending to be a moderate when [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4673.96s)]
*  really she was the most liberal member of the Senate. She's pretending to be a change agent [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4677.56s)]
*  when really she's the incumbent. Keep in mind that she has been in office now for three and a [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4681.4s)]
*  half years as part of the Biden-Harris administration. And she was perceived within [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4686.5199999999995s)]
*  that administration as their emissary to the left wing of the party. I mean, remember that when she [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4690.2s)]
*  was put on the ticket, Biden was perceived as the moderate and she was perceived as the person [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4695.16s)]
*  on the left and she was going to basically help consolidate those votes. So she's pretending to be [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4699.5599999999995s)]
*  a lot of things that she isn't. And the reason why it's working is because the press has fully [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4704.36s)]
*  cooperated in letting her run a campaign without doing press interviews, without doing unscripted [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4709.96s)]
*  appearances. And the press frankly is embarrassing itself by revealing themselves to be effectively [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4715.64s)]
*  DNC operatives. And that Time magazine cover story was just the latest example of that. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4723.64s)]
*  I do think that this strategy can only work for so long. I think that the media is starting to [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4728.12s)]
*  feel a little bit embarrassed. They're starting to get a little bit shamed about the fact they're [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4733.24s)]
*  letting her just give them the Heisman. And I don't think she can run out the clock for three [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4738.2s)]
*  months without doing interviews. I just think that she can do this for another week or so. I think [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4743.08s)]
*  that they're going to run this playbook through the convention. But eventually she's going to [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4747.32s)]
*  have to start doing interviews and she's going to have to start putting out more substantive policy [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4751.8s)]
*  proposals. And I think the fact that this price control proposal is their very first one that [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4756.44s)]
*  they've put out, I think this shows that this is not going to be easy for her. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4762.36s)]
*  It certainly jolted me awake, Sachs. I'll tell you that. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4767.56s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, this idea that she can pretend to be a moderate and just run on vibes with no [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4769.96s)]
*  interviews and no substantive proposals, I don't think it's going to work for three months. I think [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4775.56s)]
*  she's going to reveal herself. I think an educated voter base is going to wake up to that. And [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4779.160000000001s)]
*  particularly in that independent segment, there's going to be a lot of acknowledgement that maybe [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4783.080000000001s)]
*  these are not going to be the right policies. I think they're preparing their policies and [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4787.080000000001s)]
*  they're going to drop them after the DNC. Chamath, what's your take on strategy? And then we'll move [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4791.400000000001s)]
*  on to Science Corner. And we're in the middle of the relief rally that Biden isn't in the race. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4794.84s)]
*  I think that we had a different version of a relief rally when everybody realized that President [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4802.28s)]
*  Trump hadn't been assassinated. So these are the pendulum swings, I think, of an electorate that [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4808.360000000001s)]
*  still hasn't been given a clear definition of A or B. In this case, I think what's happening is [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4818.2s)]
*  there's a lot of testing of language and ideas and concepts that both sides are doing. And I think [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4826.2s)]
*  we will not know where this election is going to go until after September the 10th and that first [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4831.96s)]
*  presidential debate, because I think that these big issues will be put to the test. The journalists [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4836.599999999999s)]
*  asking the questions will corner both candidates. Both of them will have points of view. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4843.24s)]
*  And then I think they'll have to go into these five states that matter on these five issues [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4847.72s)]
*  that matter. And I do think that this will be one of those issues because this is a very aggressive [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4852.84s)]
*  proposal that has a lot of implications. And that has a lot of historical context of never having [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4858.44s)]
*  work, literally never. We haven't seen it, but it seems dumb on its face. And just to be clear, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4866.36s)]
*  there is no proposal. We're just commenting on reports of a proposal. Proposal will probably [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4874.44s)]
*  come out on Friday this weekend. So you can read it for yourselves. And we'll talk about the actual [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4878.839999999999s)]
*  proposal. If there is one, who knows? It could be bad reporting, could all be capped. Freeberg, [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4883.4s)]
*  you wanted to talk about Boeing? Well, I wanted to just highlight the Starliner project. And [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4887.719999999999s)]
*  unbelievable issues. Unbelievable. Give us an overview. And then let's let's let's chop it up [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4895.08s)]
*  to NASA astronauts flew on the Boeing Starliner capsule, June 5. And they docked with the ISS, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4900.2s)]
*  and they're now stuck on the ISS. And they might be stuck there until February, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4908.04s)]
*  because the Starliner has a number of technical issues. The astronauts cannot get back in the [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4913.240000000001s)]
*  Starliner and just fly back to Earth. NASA is kind of evaluating the options here on what to do, [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4918.04s)]
*  and whether to put them on a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule in February to get them back. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4923.96s)]
*  So I just want to talk a little bit about the history of this project and provide a little [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4928.68s)]
*  context before we highlight the particularly acute story of two astronauts being stuck in space right [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4934.04s)]
*  now, which is an incredible story. So this is a next gen space capsule that was designed to take [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4940.76s)]
*  people to and from lower orbit, basically to the ISS. And NASA, if you guys remember, in the 2000s, [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4945.72s)]
*  decided to stop making their own vessels, and they're going to start using third party contractors. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4951.96s)]
*  So they went out and had a competitive bidding process. And ultimately, in 2010, they gave both [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4956.28s)]
*  SpaceX and Boeing the winning contracts to develop these commercial crew transportation [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4963.08s)]
*  capabilities. SpaceX obviously developed the Crew Dragon capsule. So it was unveiled in 2010 as the [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4969.4s)]
*  CST-100, Boeing's first commercially developed space capsule. The company would take on all the [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4975.08s)]
*  financial risk for developing it with a fixed price contract from NASA of $4.2 billion. To date, [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4980.76s)]
*  by the way, Boeing has taken a $1.6 billion financial hit on the development of this program. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4987.320000000001s)]
*  SpaceX, by the way, won a $2.6 billion contract to develop the Crew Dragon capsule. And just to [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4993.16s)]
*  give you guys a sense, the Crew Dragon capsule has flown 13 missions thus far to the ISS. And this [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=4999.64s)]
*  was the first crewed mission flown by Boeing, both of which got contracts at the same time. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5006.44s)]
*  So originally, it was going to be a 2017 launch timeline. And I just want to hit on some of the [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5012.5199999999995s)]
*  history of the Starliner problems. 2016, it was the late- [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5016.5199999999995s)]
*  You said, just to confirm, you said it was $4.2 billion, that contract. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5019.48s)]
*  That contract with Boeing to develop the Starliner capsule. So the first issues arose in 2016 when [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5023.879999999999s)]
*  there were design problems. The first crewed flight was then pushed back to be scheduled for [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5029.16s)]
*  2019. In 2018, they found issues with propellant leaks, which led to more delays. 2019, a test [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5033.64s)]
*  flight parachute failed. December of 2019, they had their first uncrewed test flight, [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5040.68s)]
*  and there were software errors that would have caused destruction of the spacecraft. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5045.88s)]
*  This led to NASA and Boeing submitting 80 different changes that needed to happen before [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5050.68s)]
*  they did their next uncrewed test flight. So they then pushed that all the way out to 2021. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5054.76s)]
*  Boeing ended up saying it cost us half a billion dollars to do that. Then in August of 2021, 13 [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5061.16s)]
*  propulsion system valve issues were discovered on the launch pad. The flight was aborted and the [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5066.92s)]
*  capsule was returned. They eventually got it up again in space in May of 2022, and it docked with [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5073.0s)]
*  the ISS, and it returned back to Earth. Even though one of the parachutes failed when it returned to [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5079.0s)]
*  Earth, it still made it down. This again led to the 2023 first crewed launch, which means people [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5084.36s)]
*  are in the capsule. This was originally supposed to be in 2017, and they kept pushing it back [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5091.5599999999995s)]
*  because of more issues of the parachute system. And then they finally got it launched in June 5th [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5097.32s)]
*  of 2024 with two astronauts on board to go to ISS and come back. On the way, they discovered that [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5102.599999999999s)]
*  five out of the 28 maneuvering thrusters, which is how they can move this capsule through space to [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5110.36s)]
*  get it to dock with the ISS and ultimately make its way back to Earth, were malfunctioning. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5115.4s)]
*  They have now discovered five helium leaks. Helium is stored in a pressurized system [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5120.44s)]
*  to actually control those thrusters and make it move through space. And now they may not even be [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5125.32s)]
*  able to get this capsule to fly off of the ISS. So on June 28th, NASA announced that while the [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5129.5599999999995s)]
*  Starliner is theoretically capable of returning the astronauts to Earth in an emergency on the ISS, [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5136.2s)]
*  the capsule is not approved to fly until these thruster issues and the leaking helium [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5141.96s)]
*  are figured out or better understood. And they have now pushed the decision to the end of August. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5146.92s)]
*  It would be massively embarrassing for Boeing if these two astronauts had to be rescued by SpaceX. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5152.44s)]
*  It's a crew dragon capsule had to find its way up to the ISS. They hopped on and they came back to [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5160.12s)]
*  Earth. Clearly a massive problem, but it's certainly a personal and a human story now [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5164.04s)]
*  with these two astronauts stuck on the ISS. And to be clear- [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5169.0s)]
*  You've had a lot of comments on Boeing in the past, but I mean, does this feel like [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5172.5199999999995s)]
*  a continued underscoring of the issues at Boeing? [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5176.68s)]
*  And just to be clear, Chamath, the statistics are three for Starliner, two on man, one man. And then [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5179.32s)]
*  for SpaceX with the Dragon, they did 11, eight with NASA three with commercial [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5186.6s)]
*  commercially with like other passengers. Yeah. Yeah. So the NASA cargo dragon, [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5192.92s)]
*  which only has a cargo on it, not people has completed nine successful missions to and from [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5197.0s)]
*  the ISS. There are six more planned and they've obviously done 13 missions with the crew dragon. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5201.240000000001s)]
*  And by the way, I don't know if you guys know this, this is a surprise, but exciting to share [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5207.320000000001s)]
*  that we are going to have a crew dragon capsule from SpaceX at the All In Summit in LA parked on [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5212.44s)]
*  the lawns. You can actually go inside and check it out and take a little tour. It's going to be [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5217.0s)]
*  amazing. So thank you to the SpaceX team for bringing the crew dragon capsule. Chamath? [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5219.719999999999s)]
*  Chamath. My gosh. I mean, where do I begin? Look, [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5224.5199999999995s)]
*  Boeing is these three very complicated businesses that try to live as one. So you have a commercial [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5227.5599999999995s)]
*  airline business, you have a defense business, and you have the space business. I'll be the first [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5234.44s)]
*  one to say that I think it's extremely difficult to be good at any one of those three things. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5240.52s)]
*  And the probability of getting all of those three things right is basically next to impossible. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5246.4400000000005s)]
*  That's just a general comment. And I think that specialization is better. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5252.200000000001s)]
*  The second thing that I'll say is that I observed this company about five years ago, [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5257.400000000001s)]
*  and I wrote about it in my annual letter. And part of the reason why I wrote about it was there was [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5263.080000000001s)]
*  a quote, I'll never be able to judge what motivated Dennis Mullenberger, whether it was [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5268.04s)]
*  a stock price that was going to continue to go up and up, or whether it was just beating the other [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5272.2s)]
*  guy to the next rate increase. He said, he added later, if anybody ran over the rainbow for a pot [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5276.92s)]
*  of gold on stock, it would have been his. Who do you think said this? It was the incoming CEO of Boeing. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5283.0s)]
*  And I was so flabbergasted because I'd never seen something like this. So in a company where safety [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5290.6s)]
*  has to be the number one priority to have an individual that's characterized by the incoming [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5296.04s)]
*  CEO as solely focused on their compensation plan, sort of explains why there's all these fissures in [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5301.64s)]
*  this company. Because again, back to that famous Charlie Munger quote, show me the incentive, [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5309.48s)]
*  and I'll show you the outcome. If the incentive is safety and world-class engineering, that's what [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5315.4s)]
*  you'll get. But if the incentive is earnings per share growth, then that's what you will also get. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5321.4s)]
*  And Boeing was a darling of the stock market for a very long time. And now what happens is underneath, [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5328.36s)]
*  the other things that actually should matter, i.e. safety, are slightly deprioritized. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5334.92s)]
*  And then you have these issues. I really hope these two people get back safe. It seems like [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5342.2s)]
*  they're doing a lot of experiments and they love being up there. But it's a little bit unacceptable [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5347.72s)]
*  that they have to be there until February. But I do trust that if Elon has to go and get them, [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5352.76s)]
*  SpaceX will do a great job and they'll be home safe. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5358.92s)]
*  Sachs, one of the great things about this. Thank God NASA gave two contracts out of the head, [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5361.64s)]
*  give him one. Oh my God, could you imagine if that was lobby? [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5366.68s)]
*  You would be asking the Russians to go get them. And then like, you know, we're in a little, [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5370.76s)]
*  I don't know if you've been watching this. I thought we could discuss it's like, [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5374.68s)]
*  you know, is there benefit in having to dependent on Putin at this moment in time when Ukraine is [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5377.88s)]
*  making massive gains into Russian territory. I know this hasn't come up all that much, [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5382.76s)]
*  but that would be really dangerous. By the way, just back to what Friedberg said before, [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5387.08s)]
*  sorry to interrupt you before you go, Sachs, but why is this even possible? It's exactly as you [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5391.16s)]
*  said, J. Cal, we have competition. But why is competition possible? It's because of what [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5396.280000000001s)]
*  Friedberg talked about before. We didn't have a set price. The government didn't come and say, [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5400.44s)]
*  you will build it for X and I'm only doing it one time. The free market was able to solve this [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5406.44s)]
*  problem. And it turned out the more capable solution was 40% cheaper than the one that they [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5411.799999999999s)]
*  thought was going to work. And the one that was 40% cheaper was also on time. And the other one was [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5418.839999999999s)]
*  and reliable and this other one, seven, eight, nine, 10 years delayed. It's 100% [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5425.4s)]
*  Shemagh. That's a perfect example. Every day of the fact that these other ideas just don't work. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5430.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think we've pretty much beaten that capitalism is the greatest force for innovation [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5438.04s)]
*  and lowering prices. Sachs, your thoughts on this and humanity? Yeah, God forbid people will get [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5443.24s)]
*  air conditioning at a lower price, you know, and smartphones, etc. Sachs, your thoughts here? [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5449.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, if we're talking about capitalism, I think about what the Austrian [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5457.8s)]
*  economist Joseph Schumpeter said, which is capitalism is a process of creative destruction. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5462.280000000001s)]
*  And the creativity happens in the early days when you've got a founder who's creating a startup and [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5466.360000000001s)]
*  the business gets big, but then it gets older and the founder goes away. And the company can drift [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5472.52s)]
*  and become bureaucratic. And sometimes it can renew itself. And maybe you get a Brian Nicollin [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5478.36s)]
*  maybe to save it. And sometimes it doesn't. And the companies that get old and don't renew themselves [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5484.28s)]
*  eventually fade away. And they get destroyed and replaced by other startups. It's a system that [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5491.0s)]
*  has worked incredibly well in America. And that's the basis for all of our prosperity and innovation. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5497.32s)]
*  When you compare that to the political process, it's very different. I mean, the political process [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5503.96s)]
*  kind of has this knee jerk resistance to change and innovation and it has an impulse to control [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5508.599999999999s)]
*  things. It wants to control prices, it thinks it can solve problems with just top down mandates, [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5515.24s)]
*  and it doesn't reform itself. It creates new bureaucracies and never gets rid of them. I mean, [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5521.48s)]
*  we create new departments, they never go away, they just keep getting bigger and bigger. There's [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5527.5599999999995s)]
*  never any creative destruction. It's just like a blob. It's a one way ratchet of bureaucratic growth. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5530.759999999999s)]
*  So it's really clear what creates prosperity. And I do think we have now reached a point where [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5536.360000000001s)]
*  the government has gotten so big, and so out of control and so expensive, that it actually is [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5542.52s)]
*  threatening this engine of creative destruction. And at some point, I think voters are going to [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5548.52s)]
*  have to make a choice about whether they're going to try and rein in the government and create more [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5553.64s)]
*  room for capitalism innovation, or they're going to allow it to get overtaken. I love your [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5559.88s)]
*  capitalism quote and reminds me of the Winston Churchill in which I'm sure you've heard the [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5565.24s)]
*  inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings. The inherent virtue of [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5568.599999999999s)]
*  socialism is the equal sharing of miseries. It's a great quote. Winston Churchill is strong, man. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5572.92s)]
*  I'd like to hang with that dude. That's the guy I would like to hang out with. Teddy Roosevelt. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5581.96s)]
*  Oh my gosh. Drinking cigars. I would love to go drinking with Teddy and cigars, guns. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5587.32s)]
*  Wow. I like to go hunting. Churchill took a bath every day. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5592.6s)]
*  Freberg, please don't bring up this whole thing about baths because then you're going to make me [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5595.8s)]
*  pull out of my phone the three or four times you called me from the bath. And I took a screenshot. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5599.64s)]
*  I literally, Freberg's in the bath. He lights candles. He takes a picture of his pale stems [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5604.52s)]
*  and he sends it to me and calls me from the bathroom. You can't see anything. I have PTSD. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5610.76s)]
*  He's called me from the bath. I know he's in the bath because you hear this kind of like [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5617.88s)]
*  echoey kind of, you know, so it does. And it's like, Oh my God, you're in the bathtub. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5621.48s)]
*  Yeah. It's like he's calling you that he's in the bathroom. I'll call you later. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5627.08s)]
*  It's so disturbing. By the way, I mean, that invasion of Russia that you're talking about, [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5632.28s)]
*  it's not what you think it is. Here we go. So yes, we haven't had a general facts update in a while. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5636.839999999999s)]
*  I actually want to hear your take on the sacks. Like what is the story? Yeah, what is the real [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5642.2s)]
*  story with the Ukraine counter-invasion into Russia? I think you're falling for a lot of, [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5648.04s)]
*  lot of hype. I mean, what's happening is that the stage of the war is that the fighting is in the [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5652.68s)]
*  Donbass and along a 1200 kilometer front in Ukraine, where the Russians has just been pounding [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5659.4s)]
*  the Ukrainians. The Russians have more soldiers. They have more artillery. They have more air power [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5666.36s)]
*  and they have air superiority and they've just been annihilating the Ukrainians. I mean, Ukrainian [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5671.48s)]
*  casualties, according to some sources are somewhere between 30,000 and 60,000 a month. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5677.48s)]
*  It's massive and unsustainable. So what Zelensky did is he basically threw this Hail Mary, [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5682.5199999999995s)]
*  where he took some of their best forces, their best reserves and had them attack this undefended [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5688.04s)]
*  part of Russia, Kursk. And yeah, they took a few hundred miles of undefended territory, [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5693.0s)]
*  but there's nothing strategically important there. And now Russian air power is basically [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5699.24s)]
*  creating significant casualties among those forces and the Ukrainian forces are not trying [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5704.44s)]
*  to figure out what to do. I mean, they're basically running around this part of Russia, [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5709.5599999999995s)]
*  like headless chickens, trying to figure out where they can dig in and find some defensive [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5712.679999999999s)]
*  fortifications. I don't know what Zelensky is trying to accomplish. I guess it's kind of a PR [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5717.24s)]
*  offensive. A lot of people have been fooled into thinking that this is somehow a game changer in [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5721.639999999999s)]
*  the war. It's not. All Zelensky has really done is take some of his best troops away from where the [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5726.44s)]
*  strategically important fighting is, have them attack this part of Russia. And over time, [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5731.8s)]
*  Russia is just going to mop them up. Did the Russians get caught with their pants down? Yeah, [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5737.400000000001s)]
*  I guess they did. Is that an embarrassment to Putin? I guess it can be spun that way. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5741.400000000001s)]
*  Does it change the outcome of this war in any way? No, it's not. And what we're on track for is, [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5745.64s)]
*  at some point, probably next year, Ukraine is going to collapse. I mean, their position [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5752.12s)]
*  in this war is unsustainable. And taking some of their top troops, feeding them into [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5757.72s)]
*  Kursk, where they can be easily picked off by the Russians, is only going to accelerate that process. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5763.320000000001s)]
*  And then, Sax, what about Nord Stream? What we just found out about Nord Stream? [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5768.360000000001s)]
*  Well, the Nord Stream story is very strange because we're on our third or fourth explanation [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5773.160000000001s)]
*  here of what happened. I mean, it was pretty clear that somehow the US was behind it. And they've [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5777.160000000001s)]
*  been blaming... First, they said that the Russians did it, right? Which makes no sense. That'd be like [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5785.8s)]
*  the Russians shooting their own legs off. That was the first cover story. Then they kind of went with, [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5791.08s)]
*  I guess, the illusion he did it from a yacht. I guess that's the story they're on now. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5799.24s)]
*  Yeah, the Wall Street Journal report... Just to give people the background of why we're talking [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5802.92s)]
*  about this, the Wall Street Journal reported that Germans investigation into this, the people who [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5806.04s)]
*  were impacted by it. Here's the quote, the whole thing was born out of a night of heavy boosting, [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5810.76s)]
*  and the iron determination of a handful of people who had the guts to risk their lives for the [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5815.32s)]
*  country. The Ukraine operation cost around 300,000, according to people who participated in [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5818.84s)]
*  it. But the small rented yacht with a six member crew, including trained civilian divers, one was [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5823.32s)]
*  a woman whose presence helped create the illusion they were a group of friends on a pleasure cruise. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5829.48s)]
*  So you're saying you don't believe that German report? Well, no. So this report about that yacht [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5835.16s)]
*  being used and how Zaluzhny was like the mastermind of this. That report is not anything [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5841.24s)]
*  new. This has been out for, I don't know, at least six months. I've always been skeptical about this. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5847.96s)]
*  The thing to understand about the Nord Stream pipeline is that it was a massive structure [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5852.84s)]
*  surrounded by huge amounts of concrete on the ocean floor. And blowing this thing up required [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5858.36s)]
*  some significant expertise in underwater demolition. I'm just very skeptical that [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5866.44s)]
*  it could be accomplished by six guys on a yacht under Zaluzhny. I mean, the Ukrainians have never [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5871.48s)]
*  had a Navy. This just doesn't seem like something that's in their wheelhouse of capabilities. It [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5877.719999999999s)]
*  always made more sense to me that the US was involved somehow. But how do you think an article, [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5884.28s)]
*  this detail that points to the Dutch intelligence community, the German intelligence community, [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5889.08s)]
*  American intelligence, how does an article like this with this much detail [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5897.88s)]
*  then get written and put into the Wall Street Journal? How does that happen? [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5902.2s)]
*  I think intelligence sources wanted to happen. I mean, they have to get their sources from [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5906.5199999999995s)]
*  somewhere, right? And I'm just saying that this story about Zaluzhny and the yacht has, this is [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5910.12s)]
*  not new. This has been out there for many months. Look, I mean, it could be true. I mean, I guess I [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5914.2s)]
*  don't know for sure. But I guess I'm also just saying that I'm a little bit skeptical about this. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5918.76s)]
*  I mean, Seymour Hersh had other reporting from different sources who claimed that the US was [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5923.8s)]
*  behind it. And President Biden himself at a press conference said that if Russia invades Ukraine, [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5930.280000000001s)]
*  we will bring an end to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. And when a reporter asked him, [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5936.76s)]
*  how will you do that? He said, we have ways, we'll get it done. And similarly, Victoria Newland [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5941.16s)]
*  warned at a press conference that Nord Stream 2 will not move forward if Russia invades. And then [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5945.72s)]
*  lo and behold, the pipeline gets blown up. And if you're comparing which of these two forces [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5950.6s)]
*  has the capability to do something like this, I know for sure that the US does. Ukraine, [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5956.04s)]
*  I'm just a little more skeptical of- Just to give you some facts, to introduce some facts here. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5961.72s)]
*  It was only 260 feet or so down where they blew it up. I've dove to 130, 140 feet many times. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5966.52s)]
*  You can easily dive three, four, 500 feet. This is not difficult. I could dive to 260 feet [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5975.0s)]
*  with one day of training and I've done half of that. And I've only dived 25 times in my life. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5981.48s)]
*  So this is easily accomplished, Sax. And so this sounds like it's dead on. I mean, [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5988.5199999999995s)]
*  I know you don't want to- Diving? What about the explosives? [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5992.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's very simple. I mean, you're literally attaching it to a pipe and you hit boom. I mean, [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=5995.719999999999s)]
*  these people are- The Ukraine people are- I think it required a massive amount of explosives to do [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6000.04s)]
*  something like this. No, it does not. In the face of Ukraine defending itself against Russia, one of [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6005.72s)]
*  the greatest militaries on the planet, this idea that that same group of people who have held [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6012.36s)]
*  Russian at bay for two years plus can't go down 260 feet and blow it up is ridiculous. They could [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6017.96s)]
*  easily do this. This is not a difficult task. Super easy for the Ukraine army to do this. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6024.12s)]
*  I don't think you're in a position to know. I am because I have facts. 260 feet down, [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6028.84s)]
*  I've dove to 130. It's very easy to go to 260. That's your facts. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6033.96s)]
*  I mean, it's just called reality chamoff. I'm sorry, Sax is the most biased person in the world [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6038.84s)]
*  when it comes to this. It's hysterical to hear him- [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6043.16s)]
*  No, Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason, what you just said was, here are the facts. It's 260 feet down. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6045.0s)]
*  I've gone to half that. So it's possible. So they did. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6053.8s)]
*  No, no, he's saying it's too deep. Sax's premise is this is beyond the capability of the Ukraine [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6056.2s)]
*  army. That ridiculous Sax, it's easily- Well, a lot of people are dumb then. It is the stupidest [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6065.88s)]
*  concept. You're also an explosive expert as well as a professional diver. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6073.88s)]
*  Well, no, no, no. He wants us to firecrackers, so he knows what he's talking about there as well. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6078.5199999999995s)]
*  Dude, I bought pineapples. That's a quarter stick of dynamite. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6084.12s)]
*  You think six guys on a yacht did this? Easily, easily. Six Ukrainians, these are [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6086.599999999999s)]
*  hardcore mofos. You think the Ukrainians are not hardcore? They probably did it drunk. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6093.32s)]
*  They did it drunk. I bet you they were half in the bag when they blew that up. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6099.8s)]
*  That's why Russia can't beat them. I've also read the Seymour Hersh story, [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6104.599999999999s)]
*  and it just makes a lot more sense to me. That's all I'm going to say is it just makes a lot more [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6108.36s)]
*  sense to me. By the way, I've never taken away anything from the Ukrainians as a fighting force. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6111.4s)]
*  Clearly, they are fighting bravely, and they are hardcore. I've never taken that away from them. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6116.679999999999s)]
*  I'm certainly not saying that they're incompetent or anything like that. They've definitely been [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6123.0s)]
*  massively plussed up by American weapons. You'd like to see them win versus Russia and get Russia [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6127.0s)]
*  out of their country, right? I would like to see America stay out of other people's wars, [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6131.799999999999s)]
*  and I would have liked to have seen them agree to a peace deal that would have avoided this war. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6137.24s)]
*  Okay. Okay. Who would you rather wins the war, Russia or Ukraine, if you had to pick? Who would [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6140.68s)]
*  you rather see win? It's not my war. I don't think America should take sides in other people's wars. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6145.240000000001s)]
*  I think we should stay out of them, and I think we should agree to peace deals when we can, [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6148.4400000000005s)]
*  and not sabotage those peace deals. Yeah. I'm for peace deals too. I'm also for [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5B6quoahY&t=6151.96s)]
