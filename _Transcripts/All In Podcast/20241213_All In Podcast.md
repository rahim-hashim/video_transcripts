# Trump's Cabinet, Google's Quantum Chip, Apple's Flop, TikTok, State of VC with bestie Keith Rabois
**All In Podcast:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8)
*  All right, everybody. Welcome back to the number one podcast in the world, the All In Podcast. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=0.0s)]
*  With me again today, Chamath Palihapitiya, your chairman dictator. How are you doing, brother? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4.4s)]
*  How are you feeling? Great. Fresh off the holiday spectacular. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=10.88s)]
*  Good times. And then getting ready for a little ski. You and I will be doing a little skiing [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=15.92s)]
*  together with Friedberg. That'd be quite nice. I have to say, Friedberg, I don't think you've [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=20.56s)]
*  skied with me and Jason. Jason is an excellent skier. I mean, I've heard his form. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=25.2s)]
*  Have I skied with you, Jason? I don't think I have. His brother is excellent too. They're both. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=30.0s)]
*  Josh the Black Bomber is good, yeah. Shout out to Josh the Black Bomber. It's going to be fun. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=33.76s)]
*  He's got skiing hips. They kind of shift left, right, left, right. Yeah. Childbearing hips. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=39.6s)]
*  You know, it's kind of like when I went to the Tom- [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=44.0s)]
*  The hips are wider than the shoulders, yeah. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=45.6s)]
*  It reminds me of when I went to the Tom Ford. When I went to Tom Ford to get my suit, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=46.8s)]
*  I'll do that in just a second. But with us again, of course, your cackling sultan of science, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=52.16s)]
*  Friedberg, how are you doing? Have you guys seen that clip of the guy with the fake bum that runs [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=56.559999999999995s)]
*  around the city? Yes, with security guards. It's like some sort of a crypto put on or something. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  It's hilarious. This guy's got like a big Brazilian butt and he just runs around in tight caches. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  Nick, can you find the clip of this guy? Oh my God, it's so ridiculous. So funny. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=72.32s)]
*  All right. With us, the cackling with his afterglow from the holiday spectacular. Let's call it what [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=76.4s)]
*  it is. It's the Christmas spectacular. We're going to pick a side, Friedberg. How did you like our [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=81.92s)]
*  Christmas? Why are you being anti-semitic, bro? How dare you? How dare you? You can have the Hanukkah [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=87.36s)]
*  special with your two specials. And now with us in the red throne, it's fit sacks. It is stylish sacks. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=92.64s)]
*  It is. Goes to work every day in venture sacks. His name is Keith Raboy. How are you, my brother? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  Great. Great. Jason, thanks for having me. You know, it's great being more fit and more [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=109.28s)]
*  fashionable than socks is a pretty low bar. So I'm really excited to be with you all. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=115.04s)]
*  And as we love about you, you've got a little American exceptionalism, supremacy, dare I say. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=120.48s)]
*  You don't F with dictators. That's true. You don't F with them. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=145.84s)]
*  Yeah. I don't really love dictators. They're not good for society. They're not good for America, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=150.72s)]
*  but you know, it's not always America's job to fix all of that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=155.2s)]
*  All right. Well, listen. What about running companies? Should company CEOs be dictators? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=158.64s)]
*  Yes, actually. So I believe in the founder mode, the Brian Chesky founder mode. I held a conference [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=163.04s)]
*  in New York recently that Brian was nice enough to speak at called hiring, the art of hiring for [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=168.16s)]
*  founder mode. So specifically for people who subscribe, founders that subscribe to that view, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=172.64s)]
*  how do you hire people and how is that different than what you would hire in a standard, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=177.92s)]
*  you know, monstrosity of a company like Google or something? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=181.76s)]
*  Yeah, good founder mode in New York, by the way, just history, if I remember correctly, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  pure founder mode in New York. Do you want to give Keith's background? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=189.27999999999997s)]
*  Well, of course, went to Stanford with the boys, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=192.72s)]
*  Sachs and Peter Teo went on to do PayPal. He had a stint at Square. He started a bunch of other [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=197.36s)]
*  companies, worked at Founders Fund. He worked at... [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=203.12s)]
*  He went to LinkedIn. That's how it all started. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=206.16s)]
*  LinkedIn was pretty key. Like, Reid left PayPal, started LinkedIn. I joined them. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=209.76s)]
*  So yes, that's true. And then after that, I went back with Baxilevchin from PayPal Days [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=214.56s)]
*  to slide, which is on the Ashby of history. We don't have to talk about that. But then I did [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=218.96s)]
*  jump into Square as the 20th employee and helped build a pretty good company. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=223.76s)]
*  Yeah. And then Founders Fund, KOSLA, Founders Fund. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=228.0s)]
*  Then I got lazy. I became a VC, you know, became lazy, you know, decided to be a VC in 2013, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=229.84s)]
*  spent six years at KOSLA Ventures, five at Founders Fund last year, almost the last year now. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=236.39999999999998s)]
*  Before we jump in, I actually have a question for you. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=241.68s)]
*  Starting already. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=244.48s)]
*  How does that happen, Keith? How do you... You're at Founders... Sorry. And then you get... [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=245.44s)]
*  What pulled you to go and work with Vinod? And then what pulled you back? How does that process [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=250.88s)]
*  work? Because these things are typically meant to be sort of forever jobs. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=256.0s)]
*  That's true. So I had the benefit of having Vinod on the board of Square, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=259.76s)]
*  which I think is typically how executives wind up turning into VCs, is you forge a relationship [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=264.0s)]
*  with board members. So like, for example, Roll Up Ote, who runs Sequoia, had Mike Moritz on his [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=270.88s)]
*  board. Roll Up was our CFO at PayPal and Mike recruited him. So that's a very common, same thing, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=276.0s)]
*  Ravi at Sequoia today was the COO and CFO of Instacart. Again, same thing, Mike recruited him [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=283.36s)]
*  into Sequoia. So I think that's typically how people become VCs. I always knew I wanted to be [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=289.76s)]
*  a VC since 2003. I was a very activational investor, as you know, even when I was, you know, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=294.96s)]
*  concentrating on all these other jobs, I was writing a lot with checks. And so anybody who's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=300.24s)]
*  writing a lot of active angel checks probably has in the back of their mind one day, I might [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=304.32s)]
*  want to be a professional investor. We could talk about the merits or demerits of that. But like, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=307.68s)]
*  the goal was pretty clear in my mind. And then at some point, I think you have to make a decision. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=311.84s)]
*  What do you want to be in life? You know, venture has long time horizons. It is a job for life, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=317.76s)]
*  like 15, 20 years is pretty much what you have to commit to. So you don't really want to start [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=324.08s)]
*  venture when you get too old, because 20 years, you know, you'll be like Donald Trump age. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=328.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=333.84s)]
*  So I can run for president in 25 years or something. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=335.2s)]
*  Keith, why did you leave Founders Fund to go to COSA? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=339.6s)]
*  So COSA was great. I spent six years there. The truthful reason why I left, it's kind of funny, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  given COVID and how history changes. I hated commuting a Sand Hill Road every day. We were [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=347.92s)]
*  one office period in office every single day. And I felt like the future of investing was more in [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=353.76s)]
*  San Francisco than in Palo Alto at the time. And I just despised sitting in a car 45 minutes [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=361.68s)]
*  each direction. Turns out, you know, COVID changed everything, how people do their work. Like we're [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=367.44s)]
*  recording this by Zoom. Before COVID, we'd probably all be in the same studio recording a podcast [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=371.92s)]
*  like this. And so, but Vinod and the team was very inflexible about it. And Founders Fund was [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=376.64s)]
*  located in the city. Obviously, I knew Peter since college, as Jason alluded to. And I decided that, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=381.68s)]
*  it was better for me. I remember talking to Sam Altman. And I said, am I crazy for changing funds [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=387.6s)]
*  mostly on a commute basis? And Sam said, you're human. And every single study of human happiness [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=392.48s)]
*  is inversely correlated to your commute time. It's like, there's nothing wrong with being human. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=397.52000000000004s)]
*  In any event, there are a lot of similarities between FF and KV. Both are great funds that have [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=402.64s)]
*  put up incredible returns, have funded iconic founders and companies, but they're very different. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=408.24s)]
*  KV is involved as early as possible. And FF is a momentum investor and is maybe the best on the [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=414.71999999999997s)]
*  planet at being in a momentum investor. So almost every successful investment of Founders Fund over [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  eight funds was invested at $500 million or more entry valuation. And almost every single [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=426.24s)]
*  investment at KV in eight funds was like the seed or series A investment with very few exceptions [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=432.4s)]
*  ever. And so Anderil and Ramp are the only exceptions at Founders Fund. And at KV, the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=439.12s)]
*  only exception would be Stripe, which I led in 2013 or so, which is an order of magnitude higher [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=445.36s)]
*  valuation than any KV investment, initial investment ever. So KV is much more an input [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=451.76s)]
*  driven organization. Founders Fund is much more output driven. And there's great technology [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=456.96s)]
*  companies that are input driven, think Amazon, Apple, and there's great technology companies [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=460.96s)]
*  that are output driven. So you can choose, but certain people are going to be better in [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=464.72s)]
*  some environments and other people are going to thrive in other environments. I fit in really, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=468.88000000000005s)]
*  really well at KV. You enjoy the early stage. You enjoy year zero, year one, year two. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  I am very good at it. I prefer to invest as early as possible on a keynote deck only. If I meet a [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=479.52000000000004s)]
*  founder and there's a keynote deck, there's no product, there's no metrics. That's my sweet spot. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=486.24s)]
*  Because I also know nobody else in venture is good at that. Nobody else is still active in [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=489.92s)]
*  venture. What's the secret? What's the secret from a keynote to a check? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=494.24s)]
*  It comes down to founder assessment. At the end of the day, the only data point is, is this founder [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=497.84000000000003s)]
*  capable of building an iconic company, period? And I prefer to compete when there's no metrics [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=501.76s)]
*  because all the metrics are going to do is confuse you. That said, there's a lot of investors who are [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=506.56s)]
*  very good once there's product metrics, financial metrics. And so I have to compete with people who [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=510.8s)]
*  are pretty good at what they do. So I prefer to go as early as possible. And then secondly, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=515.28s)]
*  I like company building. I think part of my role is to help the founder increase the amplitude [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=518.8s)]
*  or probability of success. And I enjoy that. At FF, that's very controversial. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=524.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=529.52s)]
*  Ah, right. Yeah. The founder reigns supreme and everybody else is there to get out of the way. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=530.0799999999999s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=534.56s)]
*  I've had both KV and FF as lead investors in both climate and at Ohalo now. So I know both [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=535.04s)]
*  firms really well. And people always ask me about the difference between the two. That's always what [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=541.8399999999999s)]
*  I get to. It's like founders fund. They have this kind of mantra. They find great founders and just [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=546.0s)]
*  get out of the way, let them run. And they don't want to be helpful. That's not their objective. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=550.32s)]
*  They feel like if they have to be helpful, it's not the kind of founder. I mean, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=554.56s)]
*  keep obviously speaking outside of yourself. And then at COSLA, as you know, Vinod has been [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=557.44s)]
*  extremely and the whole team there, especially climate and always have always been extremely [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=563.36s)]
*  helpful. So adding board members, introducing commercial partners, being like very traditionally [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=568.0s)]
*  proactive participatory VCs on the board, very different, both very valuable. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=572.8s)]
*  When I had a board issue at founders fund and there were some board members that did not like [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=579.04s)]
*  my strategy, had issues with what I was doing with the company at climate corp at the time. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=584.0s)]
*  Founders fund actually stepped up and protected me and they got the board, the rest of the board [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=589.68s)]
*  together to protect me in a way that was like actually at a very kind of crucial moment for the [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=594.4799999999999s)]
*  business. And as a result, we had a massive exit within a year. I saw Brian Singerman is leaving. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=599.12s)]
*  So does anybody know which ambassadorship he's taking? I mean, the timing's a little interesting, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=605.84s)]
*  is it not? I don't know. He's got to compete with our friend, Kenny Howrey. Yeah. Ken Howrey, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=611.6s)]
*  where is he off to next? Hopefully some great destination. I'm sure. I know. So we can all [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=616.64s)]
*  crash. Yeah. Something warm this time. Okay. Sweden's a little bit much. I'll send in my wishlist [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=621.36s)]
*  for you. Yeah. Let's go. Like maybe like, is there like a Turks and Caicos or something? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=626.56s)]
*  What about an embassy tour? We should do an embassy tour this year. Yeah. St. Bart's, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=630.88s)]
*  they have an embassy there. St. Bart's. Yeah. That's a great idea. They don't, unfortunately. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=633.68s)]
*  It's a French protectorate, but. Well, you know what? Everything's on the table now. We could make [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=637.5999999999999s)]
*  them the 51st, second, third or fourth state. I mean, we're in the game right now. Canada's [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=642.4s)]
*  coming on board. Did you not want to roll in the administration yourself? No. You know, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=646.64s)]
*  the thinking, I love politics. If you follow my Twitter feed, I pay a lot of attention. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=651.5999999999999s)]
*  I used to be involved in politics before I got into tech. However, what I realized about where [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=655.84s)]
*  I am in my career in tech is if I stopped doing what I do, I'm never going to come back. Like [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=661.2800000000001s)]
*  technology is rapidly emerging. We're going to talk about all the latest developments this week. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=667.52s)]
*  Like you can't take your foot off the gas in the network building parts of venture for two to five [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=671.44s)]
*  years and come back when you're like 50 years old. And so I felt like I'm not ready to give up on [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=676.48s)]
*  venture. I'm in like the prime of my venture career. I'm only 12 years in actually tomorrow. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=681.68s)]
*  So figure five, 10 more years like is the sweet spot. And so I'd like to see the companies that [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=685.8399999999999s)]
*  I was involved in grow up, become public companies, et cetera. And I didn't feel like I could ever [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=691.04s)]
*  come back if I quit at some point when I like to get involved in politics, probably yes, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=695.8399999999999s)]
*  but it's a decade out. Well, the households involved, a big announcement. Your husband, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=701.3599999999999s)]
*  Jacob is joining the administration. You can tell us a little bit about that. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=707.52s)]
*  Jacob's going to be very proud of that. Yeah. It's extremely exciting for him, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=712.48s)]
*  obviously for the country, I think, which is he's going to be the chief economic officer, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=716.88s)]
*  really for the country. His job is to build foreign policy from the business standpoint, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=722.64s)]
*  which if you think about it, what's the foundation of power in the world? It's economic success. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=729.28s)]
*  Why did the United States win World War II is we had an economic engine that could outcompete [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=733.76s)]
*  Germany plus Russia, plus Japan. We could build more tanks, blah, blah, blah, et cetera. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=738.4s)]
*  And so the economic engine is critical to this administration. Obviously Trump understands that [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=743.2s)]
*  we had a great three years under his first administration, as he likes to say, best economy [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=748.3199999999999s)]
*  ever before COVID, which may be true. And we need to rebuild American strength. And Jacob's job is [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=752.96s)]
*  to export that philosophy. And sometimes you can build economic strength through working [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=758.56s)]
*  through foreign affairs. And so that's his main job is to be the primary point person, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=764.3199999999999s)]
*  undersecretary of economic affairs. And then they've got a bunch, the Democrats and the woke [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=769.68s)]
*  people added a bunch of other things to the title. It used to be just undersecretary of state for [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=774.88s)]
*  economic affairs. And they added like, you know, environment and all these politically correct [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=778.64s)]
*  things. So hopefully they'll subtract all that stuff and just go back to undersecretary of state [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=782.9599999999999s)]
*  for economic affairs. And interestingly, what's turning out to be interesting as Trump assembles [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=787.04s)]
*  this group, I love to get the panel's thoughts on it is not everybody thinks the same. Jacob's [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=793.52s)]
*  position on TikTok, which we'll get to in this show, very different than some other people in [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=798.9599999999999s)]
*  the administration. And even Trump himself flip flopped a little bit on that. So what are your [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=804.0s)]
*  thoughts as we get started here, just on that assembly of people, you know, including Sachs, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=809.1999999999999s)]
*  obviously who couldn't be here this week, but we'll be on future episodes. There's your [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=816.16s)]
*  announcement folks. What are your thoughts on that? The sort of diversity and opinion in the [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=820.0799999999999s)]
*  administration and how that all sorts out? Because some people- [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=826.16s)]
*  I think it's extremely exciting. I think it's very obvious watching from afar that the way Trump [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=828.56s)]
*  makes decisions is he likes to ask a lot of people a lot of different questions, and then he makes [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=833.1999999999999s)]
*  the decision. That's why he's, to some people, the media, and he's very unpredictable is he doesn't [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=837.8399999999999s)]
*  just take one source of input. And so you can never totally predict the output, but he arrays [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=844.88s)]
*  an interesting cast of characters and listens to them. Like, so for example, I haven't spent that [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=851.2s)]
*  much time with him, but in so far as I have, he would go around the room and ask every single [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=856.56s)]
*  person at dinner, what's your view on X? And literally go around the room of 28 people and [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=860.64s)]
*  listen to every single person. So I think that's how he makes decisions. X being a topic, not the [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=866.32s)]
*  website X. Not X. Yeah, everybody knows what it's about. I think he likes X. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=871.68s)]
*  Chamath, any thoughts on this, the wider team as we see it get assembled? We obviously don't [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=876.4s)]
*  have Saks here. He joined the team. What's your thoughts on the collection of characters and [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=880.9599999999999s)]
*  executives? Here's an interesting tweet that I saw, Nick. Can you just share it with the guys? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=887.52s)]
*  Oh, net worth of each one. Now, the reason why it was interesting to me was not the net worth per [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=892.7199999999999s)]
*  se, but I think this is the first time that I can remember in modern history at least that I've been [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=899.6s)]
*  in the United States and following US politics where such an enormous number of business people [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=906.64s)]
*  have been motivated to come and work inside of the administration. And I think that it creates [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=913.76s)]
*  this very interesting contrast and compare. I think that the Democrats would never have assembled [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=920.08s)]
*  a group of people like this, even though the Democratic Party has a version of this chart [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=926.72s)]
*  that they could have made. There's a lot of extremely talented business people that support [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=932.4s)]
*  the Democratic Party. The problem is that they believe it's deeply unfashionable to get strong, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=937.2s)]
*  competent business people to take a pause in their business career and come work in government. And [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=945.36s)]
*  you almost look down on people that are successful. Whereas the Republican alternative here, if it [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=949.6s)]
*  creates a movement, so to speak, so that subsequent presidents tap folks on the shoulder, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=955.2s)]
*  I think will be much better off. And the reason is pretty simple. I think that the United States [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=962.48s)]
*  economy is too complicated to be managed by theoreticians, by folks with random PhDs and [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=968.0s)]
*  absolutely no working experience in the real world. And when you bring those people in to oversee [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=975.5200000000001s)]
*  those PhDs, I think you probably get better outcomes. So I hope this becomes a standard, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=982.24s)]
*  which is ask these very talented, clearly demonstrated, successful people with judgment [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=987.12s)]
*  to hit the pause for a year or three or five, whatever it is, step into government, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=994.0s)]
*  help the country and then go back. And this was what the founding fathers Dave [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=999.36s)]
*  actually prescribed. This is what they wanted. They wanted people who are in business to do a [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1005.84s)]
*  tour of duty to serve their country and then to get out. They were not interested in career [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1010.24s)]
*  politicians, correct? I've said this a number of times, but all of the founding fathers had [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1014.88s)]
*  jobs, had professions, and they stepped in to serve their country as a civic duty, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1021.2s)]
*  participated in the process of executing the responsibilities of government, and then stepped [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1027.1200000000001s)]
*  out and went back to their private lives. I think it is such a more powerful model for government. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1034.32s)]
*  Then people who choose to be politicians to represent people as a living, because it creates [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1040.56s)]
*  extraordinarily nasty incentive structures, if that's the model, which is, for example, to curry [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1046.88s)]
*  favor with private industry participants and then go cash that favor in after you leave. And I think [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1053.04s)]
*  that this alternative where you have people who are everyone looks at them and they're all billionaires [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1059.04s)]
*  and so on, they're actually as because they're independently wealthy and they have enough money [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1063.2s)]
*  than they'll ever spend. I think Larry Page once said, you can never spend more than a billion [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1066.96s)]
*  dollars in your life. No matter how hard you try, it's literally impossible. People think like, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1070.72s)]
*  oh, you could spend all that money. Actually, when you buy stuff, most of the stuff you buy [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1074.8s)]
*  are capital assets that you end up selling later. It's very hard to spend at that level. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1077.6000000000001s)]
*  So when you have people that are truly independently wealthy, their motivation is actually [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1082.16s)]
*  quite different than someone who's trying to make it from 100K to 500K of net worth or 50K to a [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1086.88s)]
*  million of net worth. And I think it actually creates a higher degree of freedom and it [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1092.4s)]
*  aligns the people much more in the long term outcome of government rather than their own [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1098.0s)]
*  personal interests. And they're just smarter. So I'll give you a simple example. Maybe we'll talk [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1102.0800000000002s)]
*  about this later, J. Cal, I'm not sure. But when I saw the DOJ's theoretical guidance on the Google [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1108.5600000000002s)]
*  antitrust matter, their idea is to divest the browser. And I kind of scratched my head thinking, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1116.08s)]
*  would any reasonable business person think that that was the right remedy? Meanwhile, three weeks [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1125.12s)]
*  later, Google's like, here's a super chip in quantum computing that breaks the world. And I [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1131.6799999999998s)]
*  thought, how is it that these folks are so disconnected from reality that they don't [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1138.72s)]
*  understand what's actually sitting inside this company? And I think it's in part because they [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1143.12s)]
*  don't know the right questions to ask. And the reason they don't know what the right questions [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1147.36s)]
*  is asked is they've never worked in the real working world. We have a professional class [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1151.28s)]
*  of politicians and their understanding is 10 years old. But it's not just politicians. This [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1156.3999999999999s)]
*  is also bureaucrats. So my point is, these folks need to get off the sideline and work in a company [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1161.04s)]
*  for a while, know the bowels, they'll be much better able to guide these regulatory agencies [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1167.36s)]
*  if they actually just know what's going on. So if the right answer is some antitrust [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1173.84s)]
*  issue with a company where you need to divest, wouldn't it be great where like 100 smart [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1179.84s)]
*  businessmen looked at that said, that makes sense. But let me give you the counter to that, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1184.8799999999999s)]
*  Chamath, because the counter to that, which comes up a lot, just so you can frame the response, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1188.8799999999999s)]
*  is why are all these people coming out of pharma companies to regulate pharma? Why are all these [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1194.16s)]
*  people coming out of big ag companies to regulate big ag? Why are all these people that come from [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1198.0800000000002s)]
*  energy companies coming to regulate energy? The common refrain is business people are [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1201.76s)]
*  basically bringing business interests into the government by transporting themselves [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1207.8400000000001s)]
*  into these regulatory bodies versus having career politicians or what you call bureaucrats [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1212.0800000000002s)]
*  be kind of independent regulatory authority. So what's the response in that context [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1216.96s)]
*  to that, that refrain? They're absolutely right. And that's how it should work. The United States [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1220.88s)]
*  can no longer afford to be a bleeding piggy bank for bad ideas. So yeah, like if a bureaucrat [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1226.24s)]
*  thinks the right thing to do is to divest a random browser to fix Google's monopolistic tendencies, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1234.5600000000002s)]
*  that's not a remedy. Or spend tens of billions of dollars on a super on a high speed rail, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1241.7600000000002s)]
*  like you were talking about earlier this week. This is not logical. It's not meaningful. It's [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1246.88s)]
*  misguided. So if what we want is kindergarten soccer, where everybody gets to touch the ball, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1251.8400000000001s)]
*  that's what we are getting right now, which is it's not useful. So I would rather have a business [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1258.5600000000002s)]
*  person with a direct point of view. And by the way, with the level of transparency, the big issue, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1264.64s)]
*  I guess, Freebrook that that would create is, could these people advantage themselves somehow [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1269.92s)]
*  to make more wealth? But the reality is, that would be so obvious and laid bare. What happens [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1275.04s)]
*  today is they burrow at this mid level of an organization, and they do exactly this, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1281.76s)]
*  but it's not laid bare. Yep. So I'd rather be a transparent where some guy tries to take [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1286.8799999999999s)]
*  the government for $500 million, and we castigate that person, then what's happening today, which is [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1292.0s)]
*  you slip in the back door, you get paid for 500 grand from a company, then you come back to the [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1297.68s)]
*  government, then you go back, nobody knows who these people are. Nobody knows the decisions [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1303.28s)]
*  they're making. And they're altogether misguided because they're not grounded in understanding of [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1307.76s)]
*  the real economy. Keith, where do you fall? Yeah. Well, I share, actually, you're both right in [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1313.12s)]
*  some ways. If you look at what, who's Trump's pick, these successful people, they're not typically [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1318.72s)]
*  being assigned to industries they came from. So it's not like he's taking drug, you know, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1323.44s)]
*  he's actually taking the opposite, like figure RFK, for example. So I actually, I think you [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1328.0s)]
*  can take successful people who have proven themselves through merit. Like I think what [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1333.2s)]
*  that's one of the other benefits of the real world is the only way you get ahead is you're [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1337.8400000000001s)]
*  in a Darwinistic experiment with other people that are comparable. And to be successful, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1343.04s)]
*  you have to outthink, outwork, etc. And that shows up ultimately in promotions and net worths and [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1347.8400000000001s)]
*  various other metrics. So Trump has taken a lot of successful people. And I think we want a society [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1354.56s)]
*  where we aspire for our kids to be successful. We want to emulate successful people that will [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1359.28s)]
*  yield more success. Like having Elon involved in the government will yield more success than, you [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1364.56s)]
*  know, if you penalize successful people, you'll get stigmatized, you get less of. So I think if [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1370.6399999999999s)]
*  you transplant successful people into industries that they're not from, and that they have no [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1375.36s)]
*  interest in going to after the government, you might get the best of both worlds. Because I can [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1379.68s)]
*  see some of the critiques of, you know, you're regulating, you know, your friends, companies, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1384.24s)]
*  and you're gonna make money later. That said, most of Trump's people are not going to do that. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1389.52s)]
*  You can also pass laws like, you know, you can't lobby, you can't work for, for x years after. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1393.1200000000001s)]
*  There's also this great data point. I think it's in the last 60 years, Trump is the only [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1398.88s)]
*  president whose net worth went down after office. Every other president took a relatively modest [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1402.72s)]
*  net worth or mediocre net worth and turned it into a stratosphere. So you think about the president [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1409.36s)]
*  as the signature example. It's great that Trump is setting the opposite illustration. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1414.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, we've discussed this on the other pod, Keith, a couple of times, which is domain [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1420.4799999999998s)]
*  expertise can be an ankle for a founder. You know, you've got a founding team that works in the hotel [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1425.28s)]
*  business. They're going to look at something like Airbnb and say, this will never work. You've got [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1430.8799999999999s)]
*  somebody who worked in transportation. They're going to look at Uber and say that'll never work. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1434.4799999999998s)]
*  They'll look at PayPal. They worked in finance and they did say to you and the team, that's never [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1438.24s)]
*  going to work. Yeah. I mean, I think it's critical in venture to not really fall for that trap. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1442.88s)]
*  I always mentioned that I don't like people with expertise typically as founders. I think [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1448.96s)]
*  in what I call due diligence or call experts, I only ask one question, which is what is metaphysically [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1456.08s)]
*  impossible about this working? Like, is there a lot of physics that I don't understand that makes [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1461.84s)]
*  this actually impossible? And if they can't isolate a very specific principle that makes it or fact [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1467.12s)]
*  that makes it actually impossible, then I just ignore everything they're saying, you know, write [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1473.84s)]
*  a check. Yeah. Cause then it's just all vibes and opinions, et cetera. So there are experts in a prior [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1477.84s)]
*  world, right? They've learned why not. And this is actually like to combine a couple of topics here. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1483.12s)]
*  The reason why Trump is so effective. So the most interesting question to me over the last year was [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1487.84s)]
*  how is this guy who everybody in the media and everybody in, you know, the legal groups of [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1492.6399999999999s)]
*  various things is trying to attack and hate and all these people publish these books. Why is he [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1497.6s)]
*  on the precipice of being elected president of the United States twice? You must have a superpower or [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1502.48s)]
*  two. Most people do not get elected president of the United States twice. And most of the people [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1506.1599999999999s)]
*  who are attacked by everybody who has power in the establishment definitely do not get elected [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1511.04s)]
*  president twice. So when it came down to, and I interviewed a lot of people who are critics of him, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1514.6399999999999s)]
*  but knew him well, like ex cabinet people that don't like him, comes down to, he just asks a [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1519.12s)]
*  lot of why, like, why do we do this? Why do we have to do it this way? Why have we done it this way? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1524.0s)]
*  And it turns out in politics and in DC, most of the answers are pretty mediocre or weak or poor, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1528.8799999999999s)]
*  or haven't been rethought for 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 years. And so he just constantly dives in and [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1533.4399999999998s)]
*  says, why, why, why, why? And that's actually what predicts success for founders is in a domain. They [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1539.6799999999998s)]
*  don't know anything about, they're just like, why, why do we take these hotel things for granted? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1544.8799999999999s)]
*  The Airbnb case, why should they be so expensive? Why should scarcity, you know, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1548.56s)]
*  prevail in New York for four months of the year, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1552.24s)]
*  All right, let's get to our doc. And we got a ton of stuff to get to. Google's new quantum chip [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1556.48s)]
*  is super impressive, Freeberg. And we're talking about that on the group chat on Monday, Google [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1560.8799999999999s)]
*  announced its latest quantum chip. It's called Willow. Here's the chip, if you haven't seen it, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1566.72s)]
*  it's beautiful. It was fabricated in Google's new chip plant in Santa Barbara. They started this [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1571.44s)]
*  project back in 2012, their quantum computing project. And the headline basically is Willow [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1576.8s)]
*  performed a standard benchmark computation under five minutes that would have taken today's fastest [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1582.56s)]
*  supercutors 10 septillion years or 10 to the 25th power, which is billions of times older than the [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1587.6s)]
*  universe. If you don't know what quantum computing is, Freeberg will expand on it. But basically, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1592.8799999999999s)]
*  computers are binary. You've heard this before, one and zeros, quantums use qubits, you know, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1598.48s)]
*  those are zero one or both at the same time. And Google got a 5% pop, they're up 13% in the last [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1603.04s)]
*  five days, probably on the other news that Gemini 2.0 is out as well, which is unbelievable, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1612.8799999999999s)]
*  I've been playing with it. What do you think, Freeberg, of this big announcement? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1618.32s)]
*  Google's announcement is a paper published in Nature that follows a preprint they actually [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1623.76s)]
*  put out in August. So this news has been out for a little bit. There's obviously a press cycle [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1629.6s)]
*  this week around it to kind of make a big thing about it. But it is a very kind of important [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1633.1999999999998s)]
*  milestone in the evolution of quantum computing. So do you want me to kind of talk about quantum [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1638.56s)]
*  computing again? I think we've talked about this in the past, like maybe a brief primer for people, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1646.32s)]
*  but like what does this mean? Practically, I think what people want to know is when did these things [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1650.1599999999999s)]
*  actually have an impact in the way say, NVIDIA's GPUs have had? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1655.52s)]
*  The big breakthrough here is that the whole basis of a quantum computer is called a qubit or quantum [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1659.6s)]
*  bit. It's radically different than a bit, a binary digit, which we use in traditional [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1665.52s)]
*  digital computing, which is a one or a zero. A quantum bit, you can kind of think about it [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1671.52s)]
*  as a wave function. It's sort of a quantum state of a molecule. And if we can contain that quantum [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1675.84s)]
*  state and get it to interact with other molecules based on their quantum state, you can start to [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1684.72s)]
*  gather information as an output that can be the result of what we would call quantum computation. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1692.32s)]
*  That sounds complicated, but what it really means is that instead of doing kind of binary [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1699.76s)]
*  computation where we're adding numbers together or doing kind of other traditional arithmetic, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1704.0s)]
*  there are really interesting functions you can do with qubits. Qubits can, for example, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1709.68s)]
*  be entangled. So two of these molecules can actually relate to one another at a distance. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1715.76s)]
*  They can also interfere with each other, so canceling out the wave function. And then when [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1721.92s)]
*  you read it out, you get a result that is basically a very, very complex problem that is solved [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1726.24s)]
*  through this quantum interpretation. It's really hard to kind of highlight how different this is [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1734.0s)]
*  from traditional computing. So quantum computing creates entirely new opportunities for algorithms [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1740.48s)]
*  that can do really incredible things that really don't even make sense on a traditional computer. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1745.6s)]
*  They're not possible to kind of resolve on a traditional computer. And sorry, let me just [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1750.72s)]
*  state one thing. The quantum bit needs to hold its state for a period of time in order for a [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1754.16s)]
*  computation to be done. And so the big challenge in quantum computing is how do you build a quantum [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1759.84s)]
*  computer that has multiple qubits that hold their state for a long enough period of time [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1765.28s)]
*  that they don't make enough errors that you can actually do a computation with them? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1772.08s)]
*  So what Google was able to demonstrate here is they created these, call it [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1776.56s)]
*  logical qubits. So they put several qubits together, and by putting several qubits together, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1782.08s)]
*  they were able to kind of have an algorithm that sits on top of it that figures out, hey, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1787.2s)]
*  this group of physical qubits is now one logical qubit, and they balance the results of each one [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1790.88s)]
*  of them. So each one of them has some error. And as they put more of these together, what they were [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1796.64s)]
*  able to demonstrate for the first time ever is that the error went down. So when they did a three by [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1800.64s)]
*  three qubit structure, the error was higher than when they went to five by five, and then they went [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1806.0800000000002s)]
*  to seven by seven, and the error rate kept going down and down and down. So this is an important [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1810.48s)]
*  milestone because now it means that they have the technical architecture to build a chip or a [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1814.72s)]
*  computer using multiple qubits that can all kind of interact with each other with a low enough [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1820.4s)]
*  fault tolerance or a low enough error rate that they can start to do these quantum calculations. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1825.1200000000001s)]
*  This is a big area of opportunity. One of the very interesting areas that a lot of people are [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1829.6000000000001s)]
*  talking about is in cryptography. So there's an algorithm by a professor who was at MIT for many [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1834.16s)]
*  years named Shor. It's called Shor's algorithm. And in 1994, 1995, I think around that time, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1841.36s)]
*  he basically came up with this idea that you could use a quantum computer to factor numbers almost [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1847.1999999999998s)]
*  instantly. And all modern encryption standards, so all of the RSA standards, everything that [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1853.4399999999998s)]
*  Bitcoin's blockchain is built on, all of our browsers, all server technology, all computer [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1858.8s)]
*  security technology is built on algorithms that are based on number factorization. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1865.12s)]
*  So if you can factor a very large number, a number that's 256 digits long, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1871.4399999999998s)]
*  theoretically, you could break a code. And it's really impossible to do that with traditional [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1876.1599999999999s)]
*  computers at the scale that we operate our encryption standards at today. But a quantum [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1881.12s)]
*  computer can do it in seconds or minutes. And that's based on Shor's algorithm. And if you want, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1885.1999999999998s)]
*  there's some great YouTube videos that describe Shor's algorithm and how it works. But it's like [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1890.4799999999998s)]
*  mind blowing when you look at it. It's like this really like non-intuitive but simple set of steps [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1894.8799999999999s)]
*  that when you put them together on a quantum computer, it's like this thing can instantly [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1900.24s)]
*  figure out all the factors and then you can break a code. One of the things that this highlights [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1903.28s)]
*  is that in a couple of years, theoretically, if Google continues on this track, and now they build [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1906.48s)]
*  a large scale, keep a computer, they theoretically would be in a position to start to run some of [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1910.08s)]
*  these quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm. And so we're now kind of spitting distance or a [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1916.08s)]
*  couple of years. It's not really clear. Is it three years, five years, seven years, but a couple [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1920.32s)]
*  years away from having computers that theoretically could crack all encryption standards. And there [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1923.36s)]
*  are a set of encryption standards that are called post-quantum encryption. And all of computing and [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1928.72s)]
*  all software is going to need to move to post-quantum encryption in the next couple of years. So there's [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1932.96s)]
*  like this big kind of push now to like, how do we do that? How do we accelerate it? I saw Sundar post [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1936.48s)]
*  it. I saw it in my feed. I ended up missing my next meeting because I had to figure out how long [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1940.56s)]
*  will it take for us to crack the encryption standards that we use for Bitcoin. Here's the [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1947.28s)]
*  answer because I was so tilted by this idea. So if you think of Willow as essentially like one stable [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1953.36s)]
*  logical qubit equivalent in a chip, we need about 4,000 to break RSA 2048. And we need about 8,000 [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1963.4399999999998s)]
*  to break SH8256, which is the underlying encryption framework for Bitcoin. So I think you're right. I [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1973.4399999999998s)]
*  think we're in the sort of like- The end game? Two to five year shock clock. No, I mean, I think [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1980.88s)]
*  what will have to happen is some of these chains will need to obviously re-implement something at [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1986.88s)]
*  a pretty foundational level. The weird thing, as Freebrook says, is like the Willow chips error [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1992.64s)]
*  correction gets better the more of these things you start to use together. Now there are some really [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=1999.6000000000001s)]
*  big problems inside these chips. Like logical interconnects are very complicated. If you put two [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2006.96s)]
*  chips on a board, like the C2C communication is common. All this stuff that we haven't figured out [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2012.16s)]
*  how to do, but this is a big deal. And I was really like, my God, what's going on here? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2016.4s)]
*  Other projects at Google are finally landing. You have Waymo and you have this now. I mean, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2023.3600000000001s)]
*  Project Moon might be gone, but I think those projects, we're going to see a couple of them [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2029.92s)]
*  change the world. Yeah. Just to give you a sense on the numbers, like Google's target for fault [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2035.12s)]
*  tolerance on a quantum chip to make it logically useful is one times 10 to the negative six. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2039.76s)]
*  Right now, this Willow chip is kind of running at 99.7%. So it's still a few orders of magnitude [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2046.0s)]
*  away. They have a long way to go in getting the fault tolerance low enough to actually build [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2052.64s)]
*  logical gates using qubits that can resolve kind of computational output. And so there's still a [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2058.56s)]
*  build cycle ahead and that pathway is a little bit unclear. But what they've shown is this almost [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2064.8s)]
*  feels like the Shockley transistor moment. It's like, here's this transistor. Now everyone's like, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2068.6400000000003s)]
*  you have a lossy transistor and then you'll figure out PN junctions. You'll figure out all of these [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2075.28s)]
*  ways of just getting the error correction down. But by the way, this reinforces what you said [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2079.28s)]
*  before, which is it's hard for an outsider like us to comprehend what's really happening inside [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2083.92s)]
*  of Google because the business they've built was able to fund this. I mean, and I went down a rabbit [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2090.56s)]
*  hole because I'd never heard of who this guy was that runs his helmet, Nevin. He's in Santa Barbara. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2095.68s)]
*  They have a whole team at Santa Barbara. They've been running for like 10 years. He has his own [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2100.64s)]
*  law, Nevin's law. And then I went down the rabbit hole of that. But what's amazing is so valuable [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2103.7599999999998s)]
*  for humanity. Google had the money to fund him for the last 12 years. Exactly. And the greatest [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2109.36s)]
*  money printing machine of all time is paying dividends. Yeah. But isn't it great to know that [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2115.04s)]
*  Google takes these resources from search and sure, maybe there's waste and or maybe they could have [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2120.88s)]
*  done better with the black George Washington or maybe they could have done better with YouTube. But [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2127.2s)]
*  the other side is they've been able to like incubate and germinate these brilliant people [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2132.96s)]
*  that can toil away and create these important step function advances for humanity. It's really [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2138.88s)]
*  awesome. DeepMind is on that list as well. Keith, what are your thoughts about it? Yeah. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2147.76s)]
*  Yeah. So I think, first of all, I think there's a long time before this becomes a commercial product [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2151.36s)]
*  or application of any sort. So it's great that they're taking money, but think about it as like [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2156.88s)]
*  almost like Stanford takes money or the US government funds basic research in some ways. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2162.56s)]
*  This is at least a decade out kind of thing. There's another, I mean, this area way beyond [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2166.96s)]
*  my expertise, but I've been talking to a lot of smart people because I do do financial services [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2172.7200000000003s)]
*  innovation. And obviously encryption is pretty critical, whether it's Bitcoin or other places. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2175.92s)]
*  And there's a couple of concerns. One is it's not even clear that you can verify that this is true, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2180.32s)]
*  by the way, like standard computing to explain sort of the magnitude of difference. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2186.7200000000003s)]
*  Standard computing would take 10 to the 25th years to verify that what Google analysis is [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2191.36s)]
*  accurate. So there's a chance that it's not even true. For the sampling test they ran. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2198.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. They think about that 10 to the 25th number of years. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2203.76s)]
*  That's the big, I think, hole in the whole RCS benchmark that they use that it's a framework [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2207.6800000000003s)]
*  that only a quantum computer could theoretically even provide a solution. So how do you know the [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2213.28s)]
*  answer is correct? It's a guess. The question takes that long to solve. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2216.72s)]
*  And then to be practical, like, so assuming you solve all this in accurate, but while you make it [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2221.12s)]
*  fast, second, then there is the post quantum computing encryption, which, you know, a lot of [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2225.3599999999997s)]
*  people, a lot of things, a lot of poor things have switched over to. So you have historical [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2230.9599999999996s)]
*  communications that were encrypted under an old paradigm that would be vulnerable. And, you know, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2234.64s)]
*  every year that goes by like the embarrassment level or the threatening level of old historical [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2240.16s)]
*  communications will probably have some decay function or some half-life. So if it takes [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2245.2s)]
*  another 10 years, communications that were drafted 20 years ago, yeah, there'll be some embarrassing [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2249.2s)]
*  things and blah, blah, blah, blah. But the more time it takes, the more safe, you know, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2254.16s)]
*  sort of private communications and exchanges will be. So I think that's positive. Third [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2258.3199999999997s)]
*  is there's a question of order of magnitude here. You mentioned you need like three orders of [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2265.4399999999996s)]
*  magnitude sort of improvement. Is each step function, you know, incrementally easier and faster, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2269.7599999999998s)]
*  or is each step function, you know, 10 years? And I don't know that anybody knows the answer to that. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2274.48s)]
*  That's right. That's right. Yeah. A lot more work here to be done. You're not buying any quantum [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2279.76s)]
*  computing stock yet? Not yet. We have looked at KB, you know, talk about like technology forward, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2285.6s)]
*  you know, VCs over the years, I've sat through partner presentations and we've never really [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2291.28s)]
*  pulled the trigger. There's other reasons, like including like, even if you have quantum computing, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2296.4s)]
*  you have to rewrite software on top of it from a different, it's a completely different, you know, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2301.28s)]
*  world and who knows? Nothing maps, nothing maps at all. Nothing. So you're starting from scratch. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2305.52s)]
*  So you have an application layer, which might be actually an interesting business opportunity. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2309.52s)]
*  Yeah. How are these things actually going to be coded and how are developers going to interact [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2314.4s)]
*  with them? If at all, maybe by that time, it'll just be AI. How do you build a compiler? Who the [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2318.32s)]
*  hell knows? How do you build language properly? These are all complicated. Yeah. Who's going to [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2322.2400000000002s)]

*  a lot of work that's been done in this space. Like thinking about quantum computing and quantum [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2330.24s)]
*  algorithms is like an entire branch. People do spend a lot of time thinking about this and [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2334.56s)]
*  working on this and there are ways you can kind of simulate and test and start to build out models [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2339.2s)]
*  for how you could utilize quantum computers. But obviously we just don't have industrial scale [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2344.0s)]
*  systems at this point. There was one interstellar Marvel Easter egg in your announcement that I [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2350.64s)]
*  wanted to get your thoughts on Freiburg. Google said that this massive jump in performance, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2358.16s)]
*  quote, lends credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes in [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2363.2799999999997s)]
*  line with the idea that we live in a multiverse. So is that somebody in PR is high AF or reads too [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2369.44s)]
*  much science fiction? You know, you know, the crazy thing for us. So the crazy thing about [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2380.08s)]
*  quantum physics is such a mind. If you guys taken quantum mechanics, I have not. I have. Yeah. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2385.76s)]
*  I remember the summer I took it like the quantum, the first quantum mechanics class. And I was like, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2391.28s)]
*  glad it was a summer course because you really have to like think pretty deeply about what you've [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2396.1600000000003s)]
*  learned in quantum mechanics. There's just nothing about it. That's intuitive. Like the way we kind [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2401.76s)]
*  of think about the world is not the way the quantum world operates. In the case of a qubit, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2406.4s)]
*  as soon as you measure the qubit, it collapses to a value. If you try and measure it, you try [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2412.56s)]
*  and look at it, it goes to zero or one. The probability by which it goes to zero or one is [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2418.32s)]
*  defined by, you know, the quantum state right at the moment you observe it. It's just such a mind. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2422.64s)]
*  So effectively, this thing is existing in a superposition and multiple states at the same time [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2428.7999999999997s)]
*  until you try to observe it. And that's the case of quantum mechanics. So what's kind of happening, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2434.48s)]
*  I think in that language, J Cal is nothing novel was kind of discovered or represented. That's [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2439.84s)]
*  just quantum mechanics. It's a mind. And you could go watch hours of YouTube videos if you want to [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2446.56s)]
*  like get taken down the mind rabbit hole of quantum mechanics and realize nothing. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2450.96s)]
*  One thing I've always found fascinating about this discipline is that looking at a qubit changes it. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2454.96s)]
*  Like it understands it's being a sure article. There's a slit experiment. And if you try and [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2462.32s)]
*  observe a light as a particle versus a wave, it actually changes what happens, what the outcome is [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2467.68s)]
*  of it being a particle or a wave. Same with electrons. The thing about quantum mechanics [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2475.12s)]
*  is the observation of a particle changes what happens. Serious question. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2478.8799999999997s)]
*  There's question. Here it comes. Here it comes. Buckle in. When you look at the quantum, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2485.2799999999997s)]
*  can you get a better idea of the scale of Uranus? Let's move on. No, let's move on. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2490.72s)]

*  I was thinking about Schrodinger's cat. That's like another ridiculous thought experiment. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2502.64s)]
*  That's the same concept. The quantum state of the cat [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2508.72s)]
*  is it's both in the box and not in the box. You don't know whether it's in the box or not. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2514.16s)]
*  You don't know until you open the box. And then you open the box and there's an [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2517.3599999999997s)]
*  X probability that it's in the box, X probability it's not in the box. But when you don't see it, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2521.04s)]
*  it's both. It's both. And if you're a cat lady, you have three of those boxes and [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2524.72s)]
*  I'm a dog person. Well, we got more engagement from Keith on that science corner than we have. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2532.72s)]
*  Yes, than we ever did from Sachs. He's more open to science. More stylish, better BMI. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2537.12s)]
*  I need to defend Sachs. They both said, this is stupid and I'll never touch it. Except Keith was [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2544.72s)]
*  kinder and more articulate in getting there. Sachs would have just been snoring. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2551.68s)]
*  He would have done his move where he goes stupid and then like. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2559.68s)]
*  Next topic. There's an advantage of Monday partner meetings is I get to watch the science fiction [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2564.56s)]
*  stuff every week. Even if I don't really understand it. But like a decade of watching science fiction, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2569.44s)]
*  you pick up some tricks. Do you play chess with Peter Thiel while that discussion's going on? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2574.72s)]
*  Actually, so I don't play chess at all. OK. The reason why is if I do something, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2581.2000000000003s)]
*  I want to be really proficient at it. I don't have the time. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2586.32s)]
*  Got it. Also, you have a life. You have a life. Yeah, I like to do other things. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2588.96s)]
*  Things in the real world. Big shout out to Gukesh D. My Indian friend, 18 years old, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2593.2000000000003s)]
*  new world champion. I saw that. Yeah. New world champion. Was he playing Magnus? Is that who he [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2599.6800000000003s)]
*  played? Every Brown guy that's done any random useful thing in the world, we all know each other. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2607.28s)]
*  We're in a huge group chat. Oh, is it really? Yeah. What's the name of the group chat? [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2613.1200000000003s)]
*  Isn't like the top 10 tech companies. The group chat's name is What Can Brown Do For You? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2618.7200000000003s)]
*  What Can Brown Do For You? OK, there it is. Also UPS is filing a trademark infringement case. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2623.28s)]
*  Hey, speaking of chip news, Apple is making its own AI server chips for internal use. A report [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2630.0800000000004s)]
*  just came out that Broadcom and TSMC are helping them develop AI inference chips, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2636.64s)]
*  you know, inference chips like Rock, Hunchemoth. And there are obviously GPUs like Nvidia. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2642.7999999999997s)]
*  GPUs are like the giant dump trucks that help you build large language models. These [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2648.3199999999997s)]
*  inference chips are kind of like speeder bikes, you know, motorcycles quickly getting you the [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2653.44s)]
*  results from the same ones. It's called BALTRA. BALTRA. I don't know what that's in reference to. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2657.6s)]
*  Mass production in 2026. They don't plan on selling the chips. They don't plan on cloud [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2663.36s)]
*  computing. The reason they're doing this obviously is because they really want the iPhone to be the [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2668.1600000000003s)]
*  interface. And they have planted their flag that they want to have privacy and have AI working off [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2673.76s)]
*  of your local device and not having access to your data, but having a compelling AI experience. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2682.08s)]
*  My iPhone does not work. I'm sorry. I'm just going to say it. OK, I don't know what happened in- [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2688.1600000000003s)]
*  You upgraded your software. What happened? You're on iOS 18. It doesn't work. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2693.04s)]
*  After three years, I upgraded to the newest phone. I upgraded to the newest OS. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2696.88s)]
*  The phone doesn't work, meaning like to call people. I can't call my wife anymore. I can't [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2701.36s)]
*  call my kids anymore. The phone bricks constantly. My photos app doesn't work. It is just really bad. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2705.6s)]
*  And I think for a company of this scale, I don't understand how it does not go through [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2711.7599999999998s)]
*  a more complicated test harness that catches all of this. I'm not trying to complain, but because [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2716.16s)]
*  I know it's hard for them. I know it's complicated, but it's really bad. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2721.44s)]
*  You're not the only person. People are freaking out about the interface changes on photos. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2725.76s)]
*  Crashing is a major thing. And Apple intelligence just doesn't work. So it does seem, Keith, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2730.0s)]
*  that Apple has gotten off their game of making polished stuff to race to try and, I guess, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2736.2400000000002s)]
*  catch up to their perception of AI being a disruptive force at the interface level, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2742.08s)]
*  i.e. your phone or desktop. What are your thoughts on this new story about them doing more chips? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2748.56s)]
*  They've obviously had great success with the processors and phones and now the M4. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2753.92s)]
*  Incredible if you haven't tried the Mac Mini, best computer for the dollar in the world right now. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2758.64s)]
*  But what are your thoughts on Apple? So the most important thing about Apple [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2762.72s)]
*  is to remember it's vertically integrated. And vertically integrated companies, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2766.16s)]
*  when you construct them properly, have a competitive advantage that really cannot [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2769.84s)]
*  be assaulted for a decade, 20, 30, 40, 50 years. And so chips, classic illustration, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2774.16s)]
*  go all the way down to the metal and build a chip that's perfect for your desired interface, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2780.08s)]
*  your desired use cases, your desired UI, and nobody's going to be able to compete with you. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2785.2s)]
*  And if you have the resources, because you need balance sheet resources to go in the chip direction, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2789.68s)]
*  it just gives you another five to 10 year competitive advantage. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2795.68s)]
*  And so I love vertically integrated companies. I posted a pinned tweet. I think it's still [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2799.8399999999997s)]
*  my pinned tweet about vertically integrate is the solution to the best possible companies. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2803.92s)]
*  But it's very difficult. You need different teams with different skill sets and you need [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2809.28s)]
*  probably more money, truthfully, more capital. But Apple is just going to keep going down the [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2812.2400000000002s)]
*  vertical integration, software, hardware, all day long. And there's nobody else who does hardware [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2816.2400000000002s)]
*  and software together in the planet, which is kind of shocking in some ways. Is there a world [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2821.52s)]
*  class company, a company that's world class in both software and hardware? [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2825.44s)]
*  Tesla. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2829.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2830.4s)]
*  Nvidia? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2831.6800000000003s)]
*  Nvidia? Well, not really. Could they do a world class UI? Maybe. Maybe there's a foundation, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2832.72s)]
*  but you don't have a different vision, maybe a different team. Not clear. Tesla's close, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2839.7599999999998s)]
*  I guess. I'd say the software's good. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2843.7599999999998s)]
*  If you define software as it touches a consumer, Tesla, Apple, in some ways, Google, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2847.6s)]
*  maybe Meta with the Meta glasses. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2856.7999999999997s)]
*  Trying. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2859.7599999999998s)]
*  Trying. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2860.24s)]
*  Attempting. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2860.7999999999997s)]
*  You can't say Nvidia because I think Nvidia touches the consumer through an app that then [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2861.44s)]
*  sits on top of CUDA, which I think is that's a brilliant strategy for them. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2865.6s)]
*  But it's a hard game. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2869.12s)]
*  It would be Apple, then Tesla, and then a long tail of people experimenting. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2871.44s)]
*  Right. So anyway, this is the point. Apple has a lot of competitive advantages that they've [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2874.64s)]
*  actually been leveraging for about 15 years now. And even back then, Steve, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2880.2400000000002s)]
*  there's some old great Steve videos. I'll see if I can find you a clip [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2883.92s)]
*  where he talks about this very intentionally from the 1990s. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2887.36s)]
*  We came back to Apple. He said, we're doing vertical integration, basically using those [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2891.28s)]
*  words of software and hardware, and there's going to be nobody else that can compete with us. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2896.0s)]
*  I think it's in an interview he did, and it's published in the company of giants, I believe. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2900.32s)]
*  And he's perfect on point. He just followed that strategy for the next 25 years. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2905.04s)]
*  Now, you're seeing some of the manifestations, though, of a competitive strategy that gives you [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2909.92s)]
*  incredible advantages is you get very sloppy in other places, especially over time, because you [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2914.48s)]
*  have such great competitive modes that you don't have to compete at the cutting edge of this. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2919.76s)]
*  Like the Photos app is completely unusable. I'm the biggest Apple fanboy in the world. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2923.1200000000003s)]
*  I remember interviewing once with a job for Tim Cook, and I walked in and he's like, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2927.36s)]
*  why are you interested? And I said, well, I own every skew of every product you've ever produced, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2932.7200000000003s)]
*  except I don't have every color of each iPod. And he was blown away. But now, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2937.44s)]
*  my Photos app is completely unusable. So I totally understand the frustration. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2944.2400000000002s)]
*  And they are showing the decay function culturally and otherwise that eventually [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2948.96s)]
*  somebody will figure out an angle to rip them out. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2955.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2957.92s)]
*  I'll tell you, we talked about dictators at the beginning of this, Chamath, and obviously, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2958.4s)]
*  this is your real house as a dictator yourself, is there has to be a constant fear that some [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2962.16s)]
*  a-hole is going to come to your office and be like, what did you do to the Photos app? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2968.96s)]
*  And that fear does not exist inside of Apple. It's not like the mobile me. You ever hear the [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2975.44s)]
*  mobile me story where he brought the mobile me team in and said, how is mobile me supposed to [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2980.4s)]
*  work? They said, well, it's supposed to back up everything. When you buy your new phone, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2985.76s)]
*  you get everything. You never have to worry about losing the file. He slammed his hand down and [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2988.48s)]
*  said, well, why the F doesn't work that way. Fired the person, brought the next person in and [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2991.36s)]
*  said, now make it the way he said it's supposed to be game over. I don't think Tim Cook's doing that. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=2996.1600000000003s)]
*  Johnny Ives not there. And obviously, Steve Jobs not there to terrorize people. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3000.48s)]
*  Well, I don't think you look, you don't need to necessarily terrorize people. But I do think you [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3004.96s)]
*  have to go through UAT. So I think it's pretty reasonable when you have a large footprint of [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3009.2000000000003s)]
*  consumers using an app to go through user acceptance testing is like first base. And typically, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3014.32s)]
*  what happens is you can do a process of a few months where several hundred thousand people get [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3019.6000000000004s)]
*  it all over the world. And as long as you do an okay job of getting a decent distribution of people, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3024.8s)]
*  this would have come out. But I want to just talk about what Keith said as well. It's literally not [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3030.4s)]
*  just photos. It's like the phone doesn't work. So there are just core structural issues with [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3035.44s)]
*  this operating system now that makes the iPhone maybe 10 to 30% less usable. And that's really, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3041.52s)]
*  that's really frustrating. The command center, you know, when you pull up your little command center [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3051.52s)]
*  to change the brightness and your AirPods, it's just like, what are they doing? I mean, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3055.28s)]
*  by the way, so do you need a chip? Do you need a machine learning chip to do inference to figure [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3060.0s)]
*  out that when you constantly run your phone at a certain level of brightness, you should just allow [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3065.12s)]
*  the phone to be at a certain level of brightness? Why does it read? This is not this is not [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3070.72s)]
*  complicated software engineering guys. No, but this is my point. There's no [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3078.24s)]
*  arbiter of taste anymore. Taste is the backstop. We said, well, yeah, let me let me [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3083.04s)]
*  pause, double click on that for a second. So I think taste is great if you have it, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3089.52s)]
*  but there's only so many people on the planet that are going to have, you know, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3093.7599999999998s)]
*  cutting edge taste and be right. If you don't have taste, what most tech companies do is they use data. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3096.4s)]
*  Data is something that's approachable and leverageable because Apple has like this, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3102.8s)]
*  the antibodies to using data to measure success with the user experience measure, whatever success. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3107.12s)]
*  If you subtract taste, even by a bit, you don't have the scaffolding that every other company [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3113.44s)]
*  would use. And so you see the worst of both worlds. That's a great take. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3118.56s)]
*  That's a great take. I mean, you just go off the rails, right? You go off the rails. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3122.56s)]
*  So Keith, you think that you think that what happened is like when Steve Jobs isn't there [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3126.16s)]
*  and Johnny Ive isn't there, there's still a bunch of folks that probably think they have taste, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3130.08s)]
*  but the real taste folks left and there's really no scaffolding left to get more methodical. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3135.36s)]
*  The scaffolding you had at Facebook Meta, obviously, or the Google uses would catch some of the stuff, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3140.4s)]
*  but without a doubt, like no doubt about it, you know that users are less thrilled and they'd use [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3145.44s)]
*  things less and you'd fix it. And maybe even you take that to extreme, you never develop taste. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3149.28s)]
*  Like I could argue that about Google or Meta, they don't really have taste, but like, you can [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3154.32s)]
*  argue the paradigms, but fundamentally, if you don't have that backstop, if the taste subtracts [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3159.12s)]
*  even 10%, not all the way down, you're just not going to catch this stuff. And I think there's [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3164.32s)]
*  only like how many people in the world really have cutting edge technology user experience case. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3168.8s)]
*  I don't know too many. I would fund them right away. It's incredible. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3173.36s)]
*  Brian Chesky might have it. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3175.92s)]
*  It's an incredible point because I, if I'm being really insecure, I would want to say, oh yeah, [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3177.6s)]
*  I know we had a lot of taste at Facebook back in the day, but actually we had so much scaffolding [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3185.6800000000003s)]
*  around data, probably because intuitively we knew that that was way more reliable for us. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3190.7200000000003s)]
*  It's more predictable scale. It's certainly more scalable, right? Like you take Steve out, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3195.84s)]
*  you don't need a dictator, but you do need a taste and taste is artistic. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3199.52s)]
*  There's anything in venture, like scaling venture funds is really, really challenging [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3203.92s)]
*  because early stage investing is more like taste than data driven. And later stage, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3208.4s)]
*  you can use data and scale it and scaffolding. So I think there's just fields. It's a little bit [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3213.7599999999998s)]
*  also, you see like the sports teams, they just happened at Stanford when Jim Harbaugh left. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3219.04s)]
*  It took years for the decay function for like the next coaching regime to show they were completely [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3223.68s)]
*  incompetent. Like the next year, they're pretty good. Next year, they lost one more game. They [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3230.24s)]
*  should have the next year. They lost two more games. They should have blah, blah, blah. And then [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3234.0s)]
*  eventually they became like horrible. And there's a decay function with an organization when you [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3236.56s)]
*  take out the person who is the original thinker or the leader or the dictator or whatever. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3240.96s)]
*  And so I think some of this is showing up now and then playing on a field that's not [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3246.08s)]
*  favorable to them, which is there are advantages Apple has in AI, but there's some significant [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3251.6s)]
*  organizational structural disadvantages. And that's the field that people are going to be [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3256.7999999999997s)]
*  competing on for the next five years from a consumer perspective. And they're playing on [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3261.52s)]
*  a field where they don't have all the advantages in their favor. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3265.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, true. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3268.96s)]
*  Let's go to the app level here. TikTok is scrambling right now after an appeals court [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3270.72s)]
*  upheld the January 19th deadline for divestment. Here we go. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3274.72s)]
*  Meet. Here we go. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3279.44s)]
*  I refer you to my Twitter feed. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3282.4s)]
*  I mean, you and Jacob must sit. I mean, what do you do? You just sit at dinner and [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3286.48s)]
*  feed the kids and then talk about TikTok and China. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3290.7200000000003s)]
*  It's why they talk to you. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3293.84s)]
*  Obviously, you don't have a conversation in my view, like, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3295.44s)]
*  TikTok is a threat to the national security in the United States. And that's why. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3298.8s)]
*  Why? It's going to people who are like, it's just an app. It's just an app. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3304.08s)]
*  Why? Why? [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3307.6s)]
*  I think there's different dimensions. One of the problems is there's so many things wrong with [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3308.8799999999997s)]
*  TikTok that actually sometimes people get confused because there's not just one. It'd be easier [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3312.08s)]
*  sometimes if there's just one thing. So they are definitely using the app to track data about [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3316.24s)]
*  Americans. And there's evidence that regardless of what alleged protections exist, there are [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3321.04s)]
*  people in China monitoring what certain people in the United States are doing. And the CEO lied [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3328.3199999999997s)]
*  under oath to congressional committees about this. And the evidence is now in the public domain. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3334.24s)]
*  Hopefully, this Justice Department will prosecute him for lying under oath. I think setting a really [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3339.2799999999997s)]
*  good example that you cannot just purge yourself before Congress. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3343.68s)]
*  Sorry, Keith, can you double click into that? So what, how did it come into the into the open [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3346.56s)]
*  source that what he said was a lie? Like what? [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3350.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. So there are people in China who on the record have said they had access and have had [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3353.3599999999997s)]
*  access to American user data, which he swore to under oath to the Congress that they were [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3360.16s)]
*  storing the data in Texas somewhere and that there's no possibility that Chinese nationals in China [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3365.7599999999998s)]
*  could access the data. There is now several instantiations of this in the public record, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3372.3999999999996s)]
*  let alone what's privately available. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3377.12s)]
*  I mean, the case specifically too, back in 2022, ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3378.64s)]
*  had used an app to track locations, had used their app to track the location of journalists [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3384.56s)]
*  because they were trying to track leaks outside of TikTok. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3389.36s)]
*  Of course, yeah. Then secondly, let me keep going here because it's worse. So there's a law, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3392.8s)]
*  the fundamental problem is in China, there's a law that says if you're a Chinese company, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3396.88s)]
*  upon request of the CCP, you must provide all user data. So any Chinese company is subject to [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3402.6400000000003s)]
*  that law period. There's no coordinate intervention. You don't need to subpoena, blah, blah, blah. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3409.52s)]
*  And so any Chinese, any executive of that company is subject to significant penalties [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3413.6s)]
*  on the record for not providing any user data at the request of the CCP. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3421.44s)]
*  So as long as that law exists, there's a real structural threat to the United States. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3426.24s)]
*  Now, then there's the, is the app being used, manipulated on a content basis to influence [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3431.36s)]
*  policy in the United States, to disadvantage this or that or create hostilities. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3438.72s)]
*  I don't really know the answer. I think there's been studies that suggest that, [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3443.44s)]
*  and pretty rigorous methodologies, but that's a second level. And then third is there's the, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3447.44s)]
*  why the hell are we allowing Chinese companies to compete with us when no American content-based [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3454.08s)]
*  organization is allowed into the Chinese market? Whether it's Meta, Google, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3460.64s)]
*  X, you know, there's a strong argument there that Reddit, if you don't allow our content or non, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3465.52s)]
*  you know, non-Chinese content into your market, why should we be enabling Chinese companies to be [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3472.88s)]
*  successful in quotes in the U.S. market? And that's more of a fair trade, free trade. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3479.44s)]
*  Steve McLaughlin [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3484.32s)]
*  Keith, do you think that the Pegasus spyware that can infiltrate WhatsApp so that you can turn on [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3485.04s)]
*  the mic and listen remotely, and it has no fingerprints, it's very difficult to detect, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3490.0s)]
*  do you think an equivalent, let's call it a backdoor, exists inside of TikTok? [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3496.8s)]
*  Keith Sarkis Yes. So my evidence for this that I believe is an interpolation of what's in the [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3502.08s)]
*  public domain is if you looked at that vote to ban TikTok, it was extremely bipartisan, despite, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3507.04s)]
*  you know, controversy. And what happened was that vote was taken a week after there was an [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3514.24s)]
*  intelligence briefing to both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees that was, that's [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3520.16s)]
*  confidential. And the votes, you know, all of a sudden flowed through. I think there's things [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3524.4799999999996s)]
*  that are not in the public domain about TikTok that spooked a lot of elected officials and led [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3529.4399999999996s)]
*  to this bipartisan consensus. How many bipartisan votes do we see on an allegedly controversial [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3534.7999999999997s)]
*  issue that, you know, basically the vote was like, you know, like not even close in either house? [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3540.48s)]
*  Steve McLaughlin 360 to 58. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3545.84s)]
*  Keith Sarkis Yeah, when you see a vote like that on something meaningful, never. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3548.08s)]
*  Steve McLaughlin Yeah, they definitely got spooked. I mean, if you just think about Navy SEALs, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3551.52s)]
*  special forces, they're not allowed to use a lot of these apps. Government officials aren't to use [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3558.0s)]
*  these apps because they know that all you have to do is if you tracked somebody's child and their [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3561.76s)]
*  TikTok usage, now you know what the parent is. You start thinking about the security and safety [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3567.12s)]
*  of individuals and how government is crazy. Keith Sarkis So 352 votes for an incredibly [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3571.04s)]
*  popular product. Think about how bad something has to be to get a consensus of 352 votes [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3576.24s)]
*  on an app that's used by, you know, huge fraction of the American public. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3584.7999999999997s)]
*  Steve McLaughlin Past the Senate 79 to 18. And you are right. If you say you're going to ban TikTok, [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3588.3199999999997s)]
*  the vague was against TikTok, but then he opened one because that's where voters are. You're going [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3594.88s)]
*  to lose that generation of voters. Keith Sarkis Arguably, arguably. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3599.28s)]
*  Steve McLaughlin Okay. Keith Sarkis [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3602.64s)]
*  In theory, there's some risk. I can see that. Steve McLaughlin [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3603.84s)]
*  Biding 10, if he's awake, extend this window by 90 days. I don't know if grandpa is up for it, [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3607.76s)]
*  but he could extend it a bit. And obviously this with the Trump campaign, you know, he says a lot [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3615.44s)]
*  of different things. Trump has flip flopped a couple of times during his first time. He tried [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3621.12s)]
*  to ban it. Keith Sarkis [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3625.04s)]
*  Wait till he gets the readout that the rest of these guys got. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3625.92s)]
*  Steve McLaughlin Yeah. Well, and then he had mega donor [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3629.52s)]
*  and TikTok investor Jeff Yoss gave PACS $50 million and he owns 15% of it. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3632.48s)]
*  Keith Sarkis When I had dinner with him, this is the, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3638.3199999999997s)]
*  one of the things that I pointed out to him was this specific thing I said, [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3642.16s)]
*  you have to look at the Pegasus like equivalent infiltration of WhatsApp having been done on TikTok [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3645.92s)]
*  because the reality is if TikTok has 200 million users, it is true that, you know, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3654.4s)]
*  199,999,000 just don't matter. So you could turn on the microphone, you're not going to hear anything. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3661.28s)]
*  But there's probably a thousand to 10,000 to 15,000 people. And I do suspect that [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3669.76s)]
*  state actors are smart enough to figure out how to triangulate who you would want to be able to [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3676.5600000000004s)]
*  turn it on when that phone is in your pocket or when that phone is on a desk. And I'm sure you [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3682.8s)]
*  will hear all kinds of random things. And many of those things could be quite sensitive in nature. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3688.0s)]
*  So I think that this is something that the government's going to have to look at really [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3693.5200000000004s)]
*  intensely. Steve McLaughlin [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3698.48s)]
*  There's such a simple test here. What are they doing with their own people in China? They are [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3699.04s)]
*  in a police state there. They make the Stasi jealous how much they're tracking individuals [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3703.68s)]
*  in China. So if they'll do it to their own people, they would have no problem doing it to an adversary [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3708.8s)]
*  and ask yourself, if the shareholders care about money, they would be willing to divest, right? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3713.44s)]
*  No problem. They want to take the company public. So if you won't divest and get off the board as [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3719.2s)]
*  the CCP, it's because you see this as a valuable tool, right? I mean, just work through the basic [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3725.44s)]
*  logic folks, right? Steve McLaughlin [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3730.64s)]
*  At some price point, right? What I would do if I were president, I'd say, you tell me the fair [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3731.6s)]
*  market price for Tik Tok, and I'll go far. You know, I'll make sure that there's buyers. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3735.92s)]
*  Because CCP won't name any price. There is no price. That alone is the greatest tool they've [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3741.04s)]
*  ever had. That would be like giving up your nukes. Steve McLaughlin [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3746.8s)]
*  I don't think they should have to sell at a less than fair market price. I think that's, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3750.08s)]
*  you know, legit, like I believe in capitalism. But any free market should allow for, you know, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3754.0s)]
*  some price discovery. And if they can't name any price period, that suggests that you're doing [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3760.32s)]
*  something that's nefarious. There's no reason by the way, Chamath, you probably know this. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3765.6s)]
*  You know, if you meet like at least, you know, some of the times I've met with the president, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3770.4s)]
*  they take your phone away. Why do they take your phone away? Why do they take your phone away? [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3773.84s)]
*  100% exactly. Pretty obvious. Yeah. Also, there are phones that can be designed to be weapons, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3777.04s)]
*  as we've seen a number of people got some nut shots with their pagers recently. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3783.44s)]
*  All right, let's talk about venture as we wrap up here, man, Keith, for boy cooking with oil, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3788.64s)]
*  new sacks, new red meat sacks. Are you a steak guy too? Keith, you eat a steak once in a while? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3792.4s)]
*  Oh, of course. What's your cut? What's your cut? Are you cool? Are you a [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3798.88s)]
*  rib eye guy? I think Tom, eight to 10, 12 ounces, max, medium, you know, solid. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3802.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't really care. Yeah, just pretty much. But why do you I'll be a little non-American, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3809.92s)]
*  go Wagyu, you know, like you like Japanese. Yeah, sure. All right. All right. I think just [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3815.04s)]
*  shout out to my friend Kimberlin. You know, red meat Republicans. Of course. Of course. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3819.76s)]
*  I'm a big fan of this cool let slash the conus. Oh, you know, you know what I bought? [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3824.32s)]
*  Yes. I just bought recently a Denver cut, which I'd never tried. Incredible. Denver. Okay. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3829.6s)]
*  There you go. Yeah. All right. Let's wrap up with a venture update here at the darkest hour. Keith, [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3834.8s)]
*  sometimes before the dawn VC deal activity has getting close to pre COVID numbers in 2019. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3840.1600000000003s)]
*  Obviously, major funding drop off happened in 2022. Yeah, it's been a couple of years of this, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3849.1200000000003s)]
*  but deals, the number of deals is coming back, the amount being put to work coming back to, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3854.2400000000002s)]
*  I would say the steady state perhaps even normal level. And but VC exits sadly are not keeping up, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3859.36s)]
*  but we did have service now go public today up 50%. And the wrath of Lena con is officially over. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3868.1600000000003s)]
*  She's out. Andrew Ferguson is in this looks like a great appointment. Another one by Trump in the [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3875.84s)]
*  column of somebody who wants to allow business to occur and wants a free market. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3882.32s)]
*  He wants to do basically everything Lena con didn't do, which is allow some M&A. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3890.0s)]
*  Reboi, what's your pulse like here? And what's your take on the venture industry? And then we'll [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3895.1200000000003s)]
*  go into M&A and exits. We'll start with just investing. Is it is it ramping up? You're seeing [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3900.7200000000003s)]
*  high quality companies? Well, I'd say that you should cut that data by AI and non AI. And you [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3905.36s)]
*  might see a tell to different cities. My anecdotal experiences, there's AI companies where the [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3911.04s)]
*  market's pretty hot, maybe cooling a little bit, but hot and AI companies with the right team [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3917.2799999999997s)]
*  are getting funded, you know, frequently, quickly, etc. And then there's non AI companies. And I [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3922.48s)]
*  think you'll see a very different sort of chart there. I do think net net, you're probably at a [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3927.84s)]
*  steady state that looks reasonable across 40 years, you know, like, etc. But it would be [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3932.8s)]
*  interesting. And, you know, you have to make some methodological decisions about what's an AI company, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3937.84s)]
*  what's not. But if you could do that, it'd be interesting to see if the lines, you know, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3941.6800000000003s)]
*  look similar or not. But it's pretty hot, like people starting companies, founders are optimistic, [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3945.6000000000004s)]
*  crypto companies also, you know, are back in vogue, obviously due to the change in administration. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3952.0s)]
*  I think a lot of people have been hesitant to start new crypto companies, and, you know, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3956.88s)]
*  of course, confidence in the new administration, etc. So we'll see if innovation accelerates, [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3961.04s)]
*  you know, with all the new capital and all the new founders back in crypto. In enterprise software, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3967.04s)]
*  it had been pretty cool, non AI based enterprise software. But, you know, like, as you mentioned, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3974.32s)]
*  with the IPO this week, trading very aggressively, I think, you know, maybe there's some inspired [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3979.36s)]
*  inspiration there for, you know, more traditional, boring companies, Stripe, Stripe, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3985.84s)]
*  Stripe should go public, but, you know, they don't listen to me. So [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3991.6s)]
*  Yeah, you didn't know why aren't they going public, Keith? What's the story with the boys over there? [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3994.3999999999996s)]
*  Why are they waiting to get disrupted by crypto stablecoins? [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=3999.7599999999998s)]
*  Seriously, talk about missing your window. Get out there, boys. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4004.3199999999997s)]
*  They bought that crypto stablecoin company for like a billion dollars. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4007.2s)]
*  Defensive. Yeah. I personally believe and subscribe to the Vita company should go public as early as [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4009.9199999999996s)]
*  possible. And the group bill Gurley is sort of school thought. What amount of revenue, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4014.56s)]
*  what amount of revenue? 50 million minimum, but predictability matters, [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4018.3999999999996s)]
*  you know, definitely. So not just 50, like, but 50 with line of sight to 100 and knowing 100, 200. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4021.92s)]
*  I wrote a whole chapter in Elad Gill's, you know, high growth handbook on why [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4028.48s)]
*  companies should go public as early as possible. So I've been on this crusade forever. I like [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4031.76s)]
*  accountability, transparency, discipline. I think they're good things. And, you know, there's a [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4035.84s)]
*  critique that like, oh, you're not going to be innovative anymore. If you look at some of the [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4041.2000000000003s)]
*  companies we've been talking about, what are some of the most innovative companies in the world? [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4044.8s)]
*  They're public companies. It just takes the right leader to say, I'm going to be innovative and I [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4048.24s)]
*  don't care what the bureaucrats and lawyers, you know, I'm just not going to get distracted with [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4053.12s)]
*  that. And so I like public companies. And so I think you'll see a lot of the companies I am involved [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4057.12s)]
*  in go public at a fairly rapid clip by hysterical historical standards, different founders, though, [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4062.3999999999996s)]
*  have different sort of views on this. It's very reasonable. Stripe, SpaceX, you know, for example, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4067.92s)]
*  founded 2003. Who knows, you know, when it's going to be a public company. So you can have [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4073.92s)]
*  a very successful company like SpaceX or Stripe. But my preference is to go public early. And then [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4078.7200000000003s)]
*  you have the capital resources, equity or capital to be strategic, per your point about potentially [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4087.28s)]
*  missing window. And they were able to transact, you know, in that particular case and get ahead [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4092.48s)]
*  of the curve, or at least not miss the curve. But sometimes when you're a private company, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4097.12s)]
*  there are strategic assets that you can't get your hands on. And, you know, think about Facebook [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4101.36s)]
*  buying Instagram. We talked about the taste issue. Instagram had taste at the time, like Kevin had [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4106.16s)]
*  taste. And think about where meta would be. Have they not been able to acquire Instagram? [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4111.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, totally, totally different timeline. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4118.4s)]
*  Were the public currency to about what's up? [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4122.16s)]
*  Yeah, what's up? [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4124.4s)]
*  So optionality increases as you have that public currency. If you're a private buying a private, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4126.639999999999s)]
*  the acquired company needs to believe that you're going to get it over the finish line, [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4131.5199999999995s)]
*  they're going to have some liquidity at some point. Whereas with the public government, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4135.36s)]
*  they just sell within whatever their window is. Jamath, your thoughts? [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4137.679999999999s)]
*  Well, I was just going to ask Keith a question, which is what is the game theory behind [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4140.5599999999995s)]
*  Stripe not going out? Like, what's the, what's the strategic rationale? [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4144.0s)]
*  You know, honestly, yeah, without sharing, like, you know, one on one conversation sort of stuff. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4150.0s)]
*  I think the question, the burden, they inverted the burden, which is why should we go public? [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4154.639999999999s)]
*  A lot of, a lot of people ask the question the opposite way, which is, you know, why wouldn't [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4159.84s)]
*  I go public? I think their first principle thinkers, like put, per my point about Trump, [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4165.12s)]
*  and I think true of Elon, they asked like, why, and they're like, well, what advantages [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4170.24s)]
*  would we get? And I actually think the M&A one is very real. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4174.48s)]
*  It is now. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4179.12s)]
*  I think they've been able to construct alternatives to most of the advantages, [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4180.08s)]
*  but not every company is going to be able to do that. It took a lot of effort, energy, [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4185.2s)]
*  and then the question is, would you substitute that energy into something else that might be [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4188.56s)]
*  higher value creation if you weren't to like, you know, creating the alternatives to a public [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4192.320000000001s)]
*  structure? [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4197.04s)]
*  That is a great answer. Freeberg, your thoughts here on public markets, M&A, the end of the [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4198.4800000000005s)]
*  wrath of Lena Con and what we might see in the new year post-January 20th. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4203.6s)]
*  I think you, I disagree with the conflation of Lena Con into all this stuff too much. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4208.64s)]
*  She's a big company break apart kind of mandate. It has nothing to do with tech M&A, small, [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4212.88s)]
*  like the typical kind of deal flow stuff that I think you're focused on. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4217.84s)]
*  I've said this a number of times, so I'll just say it again. But I think on the, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4220.96s)]
*  on the general liquidity thing, I don't think that the thing holding up acquisitions and IPOs [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4224.88s)]
*  is markets. I actually think it's investor and board expectations on valuation relative to where [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4228.72s)]
*  they put money in the last couple of years. So if you look at the valuations from 21 to 23, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4234.56s)]
*  you know, early 23, so much money went in at such high prices. Those investors can take those [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4240.24s)]
*  companies public today. There are public, there's a public market appetite at all times [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4245.92s)]
*  for anything just depends on the valuation. And the real issue right now is that a lot of the [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4250.16s)]
*  VCs, the late stage private equities, the ones that did the big markups in the late stage, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4256.72s)]
*  D rounds, E rounds, et cetera. They don't want to take these things out and take a 60, 70% haircut [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4260.64s)]
*  on the IPO. They'd rather kind of let this thing sit private and see if they can earn their way [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4266.4s)]
*  back into the valuation that they did the market when they put the round together. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4270.64s)]
*  I 100% agree. 100% agree with this. Yeah. I mean, there is these overhangs. They're very real. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4274.4s)]
*  I don't think the exit liquidity dirts fundamentally is driven by markets. I think it's just driven by [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4280.639999999999s)]
*  the, uh, the sell side and the investor expectations. There's also a culture thing. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4286.08s)]
*  I have to say, like in talking to a number of like the leaders of these public companies that [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4289.599999999999s)]
*  were very inquisitive and M and A, they are taking the position. It's easier for us to build a [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4294.4s)]
*  competing function, a competing adjacency than do any tuck ins. They just told the corp dev people [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4300.32s)]
*  pencils down and they are not wanting to spend a year or two on a deal when they have a breakup fee, [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4306.08s)]
*  when they see what happened with Adobe, or they just think, well, why don't we just build it [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4312.5599999999995s)]
*  ourselves? Yeah, those are big deals. The small deals are different. The small deals are more, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4316.48s)]
*  the small deals are the fact that over a couple of years, like Google bought a cyber security, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4320.88s)]
*  there are these acquisitions that happen at 800 million that maybe should have been done at 200, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4324.48s)]
*  250. And again, it's the same problem that the sellers of the high quality companies demand too [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4328.8s)]
*  high a premium that the buyers of these rational scaled companies are like, that's not worth it. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4333.52s)]
*  Just like IPO candidates. So I don't know if you've got to agree. I also agree. So I used to be an [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4337.84s)]
*  antitrust litigator, which I know Jason knows. And I think I hate like, you know, the current [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4343.84s)]
*  leadership, the antitrust division, I called her a fraud and I think she is intellectually a fraud. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4350.320000000001s)]
*  Why? Well, she published a paper that was false. Like her whole claim to fame is this paper about [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4354.799999999999s)]
*  Amazon. And the data in the Amazon, the data she used in the paper at Yale was false. And in [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4360.96s)]
*  time, she's too smart to have done it accidentally. Benedict Evans wrote a good critique of it, if you [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4367.84s)]
*  want to read all about the data. Second thing is you look at Amazon, which is this alleged [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4372.24s)]
*  quintessential example. Have you heard of Shopify? Shopify is one of the biggest success stories of [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4376.5599999999995s)]
*  the last decade, right down the middle competitive Amazon. And there was nothing Amazon could do. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4382.08s)]
*  They lost the core market to a competitor that was started and, you know, went public at a very [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4386.64s)]
*  low valuation. And Shopify is dominating DTC commerce. Nobody builds a DTC commerce brand [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4391.76s)]
*  except on Shopify. So everything about her is like a fraud. That said, I don't believe that what she's [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4396.48s)]
*  done has affected, you know, exits very much at all. Because like the truth is in high-end venture, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4404.24s)]
*  like institutional venture capital, other than the WhatsApp and like maybe like applied acquisition [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4408.72s)]
*  or something, you know, one every two years, you don't drive returns in venture to an institutional [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4414.0s)]
*  venture capital fund through an M&A. Like WhatsApp may be the only one that really drove a fund [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4419.360000000001s)]
*  returning exit to a serious fund. It just doesn't happen that way. I need IPOs to return our funds. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4425.12s)]
*  Our funds are like billions of dollars. You don't get returns on lots of acquisitions at $50 million [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4431.84s)]
*  to $100 million. Yeah, but a $300 million fund. Yeah, but most funds have ballooned for lots of [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4436.639999999999s)]
*  reasons. And that's actually led to some of the perversity that, you know, David talked about. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4443.84s)]
*  If the funds get large, their tendency to do these things also increases. So yes, the seed fund can [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4449.04s)]
*  drive returns on M&A acquisitions that might be deterred in a bad, you know, hostile administration. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4455.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's my adventure fund of $500 million to $2 billion drive returns through M&A. No. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4462.72s)]
*  No, I mean, they could fill in the first one X maybe. I've been lobbying officials for a long [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4469.84s)]
*  time on this crusade. They come in and they expect that, oh, you know, M&A, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4474.08s)]
*  And I'm like, no, no, no, I could care less. Only my most mediocre companies are quiet. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4479.04s)]
*  And the IPO window has started to crack open. Just give me a couple more data points, gentlemen. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4483.84s)]
*  We ride the Chinese based self-driving car company went public on the NASDAQ last month, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4487.52s)]
*  $4.5 billion market cap Pony AI, another Chinese based self-driving car company went public in [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4494.64s)]
*  November. Klarna plans to go public in the US. I think they quietly filed Service Titan today, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4502.0s)]
*  the taping of this on Thursday and Sheen, the fast fashion company. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4507.92s)]
*  Well, she's going to have some real problems in the new administration. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4512.56s)]
*  Yeah, right. Tariffs. As we wrap here, that's a good place to wrap on. What do you think of, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4515.12s)]
*  I guess, two issues, Keith, that will end with politics as we started there. Two things seem [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4520.4s)]
*  forplexing to people in finance. One is tariffs and how that's going to work. And the other is [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4525.84s)]
*  inflation and what the impact would be on 15 million people being shipped out of the country [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4535.599999999999s)]
*  being shipped out of the country and the impact that would have on inflation vis-a-vis the [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4541.52s)]
*  unemployment rate getting even lower than the historical low it's been in our lifetimes. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4547.6s)]
*  What do you think of those two issues? Take either one. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4552.0s)]
*  Well, I think first of all, the Treasury Secretary understands this. I think Scott, [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4554.240000000001s)]
*  actually, from everybody I've talked to, I don't know him, but I've interviewed about 10 or 12 [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4558.240000000001s)]
*  people that are very successful in Wall Street. And every single one of them universally has a [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4562.400000000001s)]
*  claim for him. And they've all made points to me that these kind of subtleties, he really does [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4566.48s)]
*  grok. And so when he says you can raise tariffs without inflation, he understands how all this [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4572.48s)]
*  substitution works and is running an equation in his brain. He's a very successful trader and [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4579.28s)]
*  that's a really good skill. Also Chamath's earlier points about darwinistic evolution of brilliant [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4584.0s)]
*  people being successful, understanding how the economy actually works, he's perfect. So I think [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4589.599999999999s)]
*  you're going to see real tariffs, especially against China. And the Trump administration is [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4594.8s)]
*  completely committed to reducing inflation, the cost of eggs and groceries. And I think those [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4600.72s)]
*  things can be reconciled. I know amateur economists with random degrees from war and don't think so, [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4606.08s)]
*  but as Trump pointed out in the debate and JD Vance pointed out with some research, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4612.16s)]
*  his first administration imposed all these tariffs and there was no inflation. And then JD Vance [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4617.360000000001s)]
*  pointed out that the fed reserve has a study that says, you know, housing prices, which are a primary [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4624.0s)]
*  driver of affordability for a normal American are inflated because of illegal immigration. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4628.8s)]
*  So I think this administration- And not making more units. I mean, [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4635.04s)]
*  the Nibia-ism. Well, I think this administration, there is substitution, right? If the price of one [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4638.32s)]
*  gig goes up, consumers typically have, you know, unlike people on this podcast, typically have a [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4642.64s)]
*  limited budget. And at the end of the day, if one price goes up, you have to substitute somewhere [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4647.6s)]
*  else to the debt deflation might be negative even. So in any event, this administration is not naive [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4652.32s)]
*  and the people that Trump has put in place to drive this in treasury, the national economic council, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4658.0s)]
*  absolutely understand this and they're committed to driving down actual prices. The hardest area is [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4663.679999999999s)]
*  going to be healthcare. That is really, really difficult and it is a major driver of costs to a [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4669.04s)]
*  normal person. And Obamacare has been a disaster. The question is, what do you do about that? And I [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4674.88s)]
*  don't have an answer for you right away. I have some ideas. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4679.2s)]
*  Chamath, your thoughts on tariffs and or immigration and inflation. And that seems to be a place where [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4683.84s)]
*  even across the aisle, you got people debating. I think Keith said it pretty well, which is that [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4690.16s)]
*  we do have a lot of experience with how tariffs can be implemented and that the practical experience [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4694.16s)]
*  is not what the fear mongering is about. That being said, I think the devil will be in the details, [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4700.639999999999s)]
*  which markets for which goods, what is the tariff and why. What I hope happens is that if we can [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4707.68s)]
*  really study the second and third order degree impacts of some of these markets, what the tariff [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4714.8s)]
*  does is it acts almost as a reverse subsidy for American companies to compete. I'll give you one [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4722.240000000001s)]
*  very narrow example. If you believe in electrifying the American economy, one of the underlying things [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4727.84s)]
*  that you need are electric motors, right? Electric motors and electric batteries. And just to double [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4737.36s)]
*  click on electric motors for a second, electric motors needs a permanent magnet. If you look inside [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4741.679999999999s)]
*  of a permanent magnet, there are these rare earths that are just required to make these magnets. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4747.599999999999s)]
*  But as it turns out, it is impossible for any company that is not a Chinese company [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4753.28s)]
*  to be able to manufacture these magnets in an economically viable way. And the reason is [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4759.679999999999s)]
*  not only can China make it and they can make it in the absence of a lot of environmental controls, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4767.5199999999995s)]
*  they'll also subsidize. So if anybody tries to compete, they'll just inject a subsidy into that [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4772.96s)]
*  economic supply chain where they're always cheaper. So what do you do, Jason? If you can observe that [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4777.68s)]
*  and realize that we want supply chain diversity, what the tariff does is it starts to push back [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4784.5599999999995s)]
*  on those kinds of activities because it doesn't allow it to continue to work. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4791.36s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Then if you take that with what the United States government already does through [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4794.8s)]
*  the DOE, which is through subsidies and underwriting, this is what I mean by it could [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4800.320000000001s)]
*  be a really amazing new moment for the American economy. And that would please a lot of people, [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4806.0s)]
*  including a lot of people on the left, if they just took the time to understand what's being [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4811.2s)]
*  proposed. I mean, look at rare earths. You mentioned them. We have some of the great deposits in the [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4815.360000000001s)]
*  world in our country. Why can't we get them? We have one of the largest lithium deposits in the [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4821.68s)]
*  world. It's because of environmental regulations. And it's the same thing with Starship going up. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4825.52s)]
*  We got a lot of regulations in this country. I understand people want to do the right thing, [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4830.64s)]
*  but we also have a lot of debt. And if we could start mining rare earth metals here [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4833.4400000000005s)]
*  and maybe loosen the regulations. The lithium supply chain is another [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4838.4800000000005s)]
*  really good one that's emblematic of all of this, but there are so many other markets. I'm sure that [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4842.64s)]
*  if you looked in something that's a little bit more down the middle, like appliances, [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4847.36s)]
*  what you would also see is the same thing where Whirlpool will try to make an appliance or [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4852.08s)]
*  Bissell will try to make a vacuum cleaner. And the Chinese equivalent [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4857.759999999999s)]
*  makes it almost like fighting uphill. And there has to be a way to course correct that. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4862.88s)]
*  Well, I mean, look at BYD, some of these cars, they're just copying wholesale everything Tesla's [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4868.4s)]
*  done in their design and feature set, and they're half the price. And so they're selling really well [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4872.8s)]
*  in countries that allow them and they would decimate US automakers and German automakers. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4879.76s)]
*  By the way, a different version of this, I wrote this in my weekly newsletter, but I was curious [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4884.72s)]
*  why these Chinese models are so good. And I was like, the training of these models seems to be [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4890.8s)]
*  quite fast. The quality of these models are really good, the Alibaba model, et cetera. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4896.0s)]
*  And part of what you realize is when they do their training runs, the Chinese models have no guardrails [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4899.76s)]
*  in the sense that there's no copyright checks. No, there's just none of these things that otherwise [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4908.0s)]
*  slow down an American company to make a useful model. They don't have any of those things. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4913.84s)]
*  So that's another example where maybe there's not an economic tariff, but there has to be [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4918.96s)]
*  a simple reciprocity. And in the absence of reciprocity, [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4923.6s)]
*  I think it's reasonable to say that there needs to be checks and balances. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4928.16s)]
*  Freeberg, anything to add there on tariffs or, okay, four, Jamath Paliha-Hapatia, [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4931.76s)]
*  your chairman dictator, the sultan of science, and Nusax, better BMI, hates dictators. What's [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4936.88s)]
*  your take on Ukraine? Maybe we could fire up a Ukraine discussion. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4944.0s)]
*  I can get into here. How do you feel about Ukraine? [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4947.2s)]
*  No, no, no. I'm falling in love with Kiev. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4951.5199999999995s)]
*  By the time you have me back, hopefully that's solved. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4954.88s)]
*  Hopefully that's solved. Day one, we're going to solve it on day one. Okay? [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4957.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4961.04s)]
*  Keith, you were excellent. You were tremendous. Keith Raboi, excellent husband, very, very effective, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4961.5199999999995s)]
*  great, great American. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4968.24s)]
*  Great host, great co-host. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4969.599999999999s)]
*  Awesome. You may have heard of two words, all in. Okay, you may have heard of it. David Sacks, [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4971.28s)]
*  brilliant crypto. I mean, we didn't even dive into crypto. I mean, [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4976.959999999999s)]
*  people are going a little nutty on this crypto. What do you think about all this crazy crypto [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4982.24s)]
*  going on here, Keith? Everything's spiking back up, XRP, Bitcoin. What do you think of [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4986.799999999999s)]
*  Saler? I know the Saler fans are like obsessing about him coming on the pod. What do you think [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4993.5199999999995s)]
*  of Saler taking these loans to buy Bitcoin and that other people are following suit to [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=4998.16s)]
*  put it in their treasury? [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5002.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, short version on crypto generally is I still think the primary use case is speculation. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5004.08s)]
*  Not that there's anything wrong with that. People speculate on stocks, retail, trading. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5008.48s)]
*  People speculate on football games, gambling. The natural tendency for humans to want to speculate [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5012.0s)]
*  is very real. The art to me is because everybody's now a node connected into these crypto, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5017.68s)]
*  let's call Bitcoin, can you build an application on top that would have too much inertia, too much [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5024.48s)]
*  friction to start from scratch, but it has real value. I think it's possible because so many [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5031.2s)]
*  people are now connected based upon speculation initially. That's what's exciting to me. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5035.76s)]
*  We've watched speculation before in crypto markets and it's very volatile. Hopefully, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5043.04s)]
*  someone builds real layers of productivity or utility on top, but takes advantage of the [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5049.12s)]
*  network. It's a little bit like back in your days at Facebook, Tomoth, you had the social [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5055.12s)]
*  graph and you'd say you can build applications on top of the social graph, but if you had to [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5059.12s)]
*  create a social graph from scratch, that was a heroic effort and nobody else was going to do it. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5062.64s)]
*  That was literally the Facebook monopoly story. I think that's true of crypto. There's lots of [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5066.0s)]
*  nodes. Someone's got a social graph against it. There's no Zuckerberg to rug pull and say you [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5071.2s)]
*  can't use it. Someone's got to build the application on top and then it'd be extremely exciting. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5075.68s)]
*  What do you think, Freeberg? You were monitoring this sailor situation, the Mr. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5080.4s)]
*  Micro strategy. Well, I think the way the sailor financial structure is set up is it looks a lot [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5085.84s)]
*  like a synthetic call option on Bitcoin. You get a convertible note, so you earn a coupon on the [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5094.8s)]
*  note and then you have a conversion price, which is a premium to the stock price, which you can [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5101.2s)]
*  translate. If you look at the book value or the net asset value of the stock, that's how much [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5105.6s)]
*  Bitcoin there is. It was two and a half to one, I think. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5111.28s)]
*  Yeah, the premium that the conversion price is at tells you what Bitcoin needs to be for you to have [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5116.16s)]
*  equity upside. It's effectively a convertible note. You earn a coupon and then you have a conversion [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5120.96s)]
*  premium that you can convert to equity, which basically gives you a call option. You're saying [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5126.4s)]
*  the premium you're paying is the price for the call option, effectively, and you're earning [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5133.12s)]
*  this kind of coupon in the meantime. It's a way for some people to trade the price of Bitcoin. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5137.36s)]
*  Seems like this guy said a lot of hedge funds. I don't know if you guys saw the CNBC article [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5142.16s)]
*  that it's like where Bloomberg, it's the hottest trade in hedge fund land right now, [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5146.08s)]
*  is to buy up these convertible notes that he's issuing. If you actually were to sit down [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5150.32s)]
*  and do the Black Shell's modeling of the value of the synthetic call option that he's selling you [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5154.88s)]
*  with the convertible note, there's a reason people are paying for it. They think that there's value [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5161.679999999999s)]
*  there. So there's certainly something to the structure that makes sense. All right. So for [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5165.84s)]
*  your Sultan of Science, the dictator and FitSax. FitSax here, a low BMI, low heart rate. What's the [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5170.8s)]
*  heart rate at right now? 40 to 42, like measured by eight sleep in typical day. Oh, eight sleep. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5177.84s)]
*  What do you think of our Knicks by the way? Oh, well, we'll see. I don't know if I would have [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5185.84s)]
*  made that trade honestly, but for Carl Anthony Towns, really fascinating. He's playing so good. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5190.24s)]
*  I know. But like I think you had the chemistry all dialed in and hopefully they build back better, [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5195.84s)]
*  you know, like back. Absolutely. All right. Listen, we'll see you all next time. Don't worry. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5201.92s)]
*  Sax isn't going anywhere. It's just a little bit busy right now. There's a transition going on. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5206.8s)]
*  Sax is transitioning and we'll see the pot will transition as well. We'll see what it looks like [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5211.2s)]
*  in the new year. We have a good lineup of co-hosts. We're going to do eight weeks. It's going to be [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5216.24s)]

*  Keith, that was great. Thank you. You did great, Keith. Thank you for joining us. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-vCUB5AA8&t=5228.5599999999995s)]
