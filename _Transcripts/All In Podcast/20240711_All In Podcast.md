*  Getting ready according to reports. I don't know if we can talk about this, but David Sachs is in [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=206.88s)]

*  I don't know what to say. I'm doing it, but it got out there [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  so I guess there's no hiding so we'll keep the cards close to the chest and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=243.3s)]
*  from [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=248.36s)]

*  Sunning happening last couple of weeks. Yeah enjoying enjoying the enjoying the vitamin D. All right, gentlemen, let's get to the docket [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=264.12s)]
*  There's a lot to talk about let's let's start with macro [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=271.24s)]
*  We haven't talked macro everybody wants to start a little macro and I got a lot of news today [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=273.98s)]
*  The big question is has the soft landing been secured? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=277.8s)]
*  Obviously stocks are still surging records again this week last week [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=281.38s)]
*  All the jobs seem to have burned off and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=285.62s)]
*  Unemployment is moving up that was one of Jay Powell's major efforts and all the stimmy savings as you pointed out your mouth are a [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=289.5s)]
*  Long gone and today the big news CPI came in at 3% perhaps [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=295.82s)]
*  Inflation has been cracked. Here's your chart gentlemen [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=301.5s)]
*  Economists were expecting 3.1. So the print was meaningfully cooler than expected and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=306.22s)]
*  CPI actually fell 10 Bips on a month-on-month basis [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=311.3s)]
*  obviously when you see that three handle that is year over year and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=315.26000000000005s)]
*  This is the first time [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=320.1s)]
*  We had month-over-month CPI [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=322.22s)]
*  Decreased since May of 2020 so lowest CPI in three years [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=324.58000000000004s)]
*  Jay Powell said the Fed doesn't need he said this earlier this week [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=330.18s)]
*  He doesn't need to see the 2% inflation to start the cuts [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=332.86s)]
*  Obviously, he I guess he wants to steer or speed up going into the turn [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=335.70000000000005s)]
*  So [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=339.46000000000004s)]
*  September cut looks highly likely if you look at the prediction markets fed funds [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=340.70000000000005s)]
*  Futures now see an 89% chance of at least one rate cut by September. That's up from 73% [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=346.42s)]
*  Before the print according to FedWatch. That's a tool that tracks interest rate traders [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=353.14000000000004s)]
*  We discussed the Fed wanting to see [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=359.46000000000004s)]
*  Employment and savings cool well in June unemployment was 4.1% the highest since [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=362.76s)]
*  2021 up from 4% in May. Here's the stunning chart of unemployment since [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=368.12s)]
*  1948 in April 2023 unemployment bottomed out at 3.4% the lowest since any of us were born [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=373.6s)]
*  1969 and you can see here there's been an uptick from this incredible historic low so [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=381.04s)]
*  Soft landing appears to be working the jobs market slowing down inflation has dropped tempered and [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=388.16s)]
*  The market continues to hit all those all-time highs S&P up 26% since last year [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=395.04s)]
*  Mostly, of course, thanks to Nvidia's [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=402.04s)]
*  record breaking performance, but also meta Amazon Microsoft a lot of the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=404.8s)]
*  the fang [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=410.24s)]
*  Magnificent seven, so I guess tomorrow let's just start with you has the soft landing been secure. I [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=411.76000000000005s)]
*  Mean, it's pretty incredible actually, but it looks like [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  There's a really good chance that it has I [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=423.12s)]
*  think the bigger question though is if [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=426.36s)]
*  We are on the verge of a real contraction in the economy [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=428.72s)]
*  And I think there's been enough people that have warned you have to remember like even though [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=433.88000000000005s)]
*  The stock market for seven companies is hitting all-time highs the stock market for every other company that isn't those seven companies have not and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=438.08000000000004s)]
*  That really is about just the broad-based demand in the economy. So yeah, I think that inflation is [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=447.64000000000004s)]
*  Contracting but it could be contracting for a combination of reasons one is because we have we have had high rates for a long time [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=453.68s)]
*  But the other part is now people aren't employed. There is no money and [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=461.96000000000004s)]
*  The question is whether you have some sort of contraction economically that is measured by a recession or not [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=466.64s)]
*  I think that's a really big question. What happens in the next couple quarters? Do we have a little mini recession or not? Okay [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=472.08s)]
*  Free bird your thoughts and then we'll go to sex. I [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=478.40000000000003s)]
*  think the markets priced in a lot of the expectation already if you look at the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=481.96000000000004s)]
*  PE chart on the s&p 500 going back five years. Let's pull this one up real quick [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=486.76s)]
*  You can see that we peaked out obviously in 2020 [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=492.28000000000003s)]
*  2021 [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=496.04s)]
*  Where we had a big boom? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  with all the stimulus money coming in and [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=499.40000000000003s)]
*  All the money found its way into the markets during the end of the ZERP era [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=502.16s)]
*  and then there was the slow wind down as we started to hike rates and then rate hikes peaked and [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=505.44s)]
*  Now despite the fact that rate hikes [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=512.64s)]
*  Have stopped and there have been conversations about when the reversal will happen the markets already started to price in that reversal [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=515.2s)]
*  so with respect to like [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=521.74s)]
*  Market valuations we have still seen a rather significant [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=523.24s)]
*  Increase in the PE ratio across the s&p 500 not to Chamath's point a large percentage of that is [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=527.16s)]
*  Contributed to by the top seven tech companies that are driving that ratio inflation [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=532.44s)]
*  But a lot of the market makers have already started to take action [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=537.5600000000001s)]
*  Expecting the rate cuts to come in as you point out JL 90% plus likelihood of rate cuts happening this year [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=541.72s)]
*  So I don't know how much market action we will see but there has been a lot of conversation from DC [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=548.26s)]
*  About the Fed should reset expectations on inflation from two to three percent [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=553.64s)]
*  And if they did that that that becomes the new normal and we're never gonna get back to two percent [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=558.66s)]
*  At least in this current kind of era [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=564.28s)]
*  That might be the era that we start the level that we're talking about that talking about that freeberg of that like [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=567.4s)]
*  That's been a big interest that the the Jerome Powell [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=573.6800000000001s)]
*  mandate of two percent inflation [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=577.52s)]
*  May be an expectation that cannot be met given the amount of stimulus that went into the economy [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=580.48s)]
*  During kovat that it could take a decade to earn its way out as a result [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=585.8s)]
*  We will not see a normalized contraction of that capital coming out of the markets in a way that will get us back down to two [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=589.76s)]
*  Percent inflation for the time being and I just saw a presentation by a bunch of food company executives [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=595.24s)]
*  Recently and they took 13 to 15 percent price hikes last year and you've heard Elizabeth Warren kind of chime on about this [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=601.1999999999999s)]
*  But the reality is that inflation is not just in the US but around the world and it affects the US markets as well [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=607.6999999999999s)]
*  because a lot of US companies have had to raise prices because of their dependence on labor and [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=613.86s)]
*  Materials and commodities from other countries that are inflating they call this the inputs, right? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=618.66s)]
*  This is what they say the exactly and because of the way that the globalized economy works today [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=624.18s)]
*  The inflation around the world is going to continue to buoy inflation in the US even if we get our house in order [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=628.42s)]
*  so it's very unlikely that we get back to a two-handle and [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=633.5s)]
*  You know at least in this kind of era and as a result, you'll probably see the [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=637.66s)]
*  The market kind of assume that we're gonna be at a 3% kind of inflation level for quite some time [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=642.18s)]
*  It's very interesting the obsession with it with the two. I brought this up on the show [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=647.38s)]
*  The the 2% handle and this target came from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's guy Roger Douglas [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=651.8199999999999s)]
*  Minister of Finance and he came up with it because they just asked them like well [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=658.42s)]
*  What's a healthy one and he came up with that and then everybody adopted it the Dunder Mifflin inflation index [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=662.62s)]
*  Basically, it's just sitting out there. Okay, so first [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=667.86s)]
*  objective [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=671.42s)]
*  Nonpartisan view of all this incredible economic data. We go to our RNC [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=672.8199999999999s)]
*  Correspondent David Sacks throw a wet blanket on this incredible news. I'm as nonpartisan as you are Jake out [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=677.86s)]
*  Like you're a candidate in this race. I am a modern independent as we all know from my Fox News hits [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=684.6999999999999s)]
*  Yes, exactly Fox News has hired you to provide the opposite point of view in any event [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=690.54s)]
*  Sorry, what's your question? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=695.8199999999999s)]
*  Joking obviously, but a little bit but this is just [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=699.58s)]
*  rate the feds [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=704.7s)]
*  Reaction to this it seems like you know feds supposed to be independent. Obviously this this fed chair has worked across an administration. So [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=706.74s)]
*  We've said here very critically they got started too late [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=714.1s)]
*  They should have got ahead of this but I mean rate their performance [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=716.62s)]
*  Since then do you think they're nailing this and there's gonna be a soft landing what you have concerns [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=719.66s)]
*  You're optimistic about the economy and how they've handled it [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=723.74s)]
*  Well, the feds mistake was just waiting way too long to react to the inflation and they didn't just wait nine months [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=726.78s)]
*  After the first inflation print came in that was too high before they start raising rates. They continue QE for six more months [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=734.14s)]
*  So when you talk about all this stimulus that's still in the economy that they can't seem to get rid of a lot of that [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=740.98s)]
*  Was created by the feds QE in the second half of 2021 that should never have happened [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=746.74s)]
*  Since then they did what they had to do, which is they increased rates to solve inflation. That's what you do and [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=751.7800000000001s)]
*  Yes, it does seem to be working but we still have [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=758.1800000000001s)]
*  Inflation being persistently high at 3% [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=761.7s)]
*  And so now like freeberg saying they're trying to change the goalpost to somehow normalize 3% [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=764.5s)]
*  we should just understand that what that means is permanently higher interest rates because [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=769.58s)]
*  The Fed has to offer or under normal circumstances [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=775.0600000000001s)]
*  Has to offer a return above the rate of inflation [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=778.7s)]
*  So whatever that return is 1% 2% you stack that on top of the inflation rate [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=782.38s)]
*  So in other words, let's say the Fed wanted to target a 2% real return [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=788.24s)]
*  that means that the [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=793.14s)]
*  Interest rate would be 5% with the 3% rate of inflation [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=795.3000000000001s)]
*  Whereas if inflation can be managed down to 2% you would have a 4% interest rate and that [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=798.78s)]
*  Persistently if we're talking permanently higher interest rate will create a drag on the economy because lower interest rates create [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=806.5s)]
*  More investment they reduce the hurdle rates to take risk [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=813.78s)]
*  Whereas higher interest rates as we've seen create drag on equities and drag on investment [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=818.5799999999999s)]
*  So if they redefine the inflation rate to 3 instead of 2 there will be long-term consequences from that [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=824.6999999999999s)]
*  That is not a free thing to do [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=830.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so that would be like one part of the answer the other thing is just yeah look inflation going from 3.1 to 3.0 is [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=833.42s)]
*  Positive it's good news better than it going from 3.1 to 3.2 [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=841.46s)]
*  But we're talking about 0.1% and I just think people get a little too excited reading into these prints [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=845.58s)]
*  When these are not huge changes in numbers, I do think that once the inflation rate starts with a two-handle [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=852.82s)]
*  That psychologically I think will be a big change for people [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=859.86s)]
*  Psychology has so much to do with this [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=863.18s)]
*  I thought I was doing a little research on it why it's so contentious and there's so much of a lack of consensus about it [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=864.5799999999999s)]
*  Nick pull up this chart. I wanted to share it with you guys. This is [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=871.06s)]
*  basically a [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=874.38s)]
*  psychological phenomenon called partisan economic perception and this has been studied for some time and [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=875.5799999999999s)]
*  It's really interesting about it is it shows [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=881.8199999999999s)]
*  What percentage of people who are Democrats and Republicans here in the United States of America say the economy is good [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=884.8199999999999s)]
*  And if you look at Clinton and you know, he got to [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=890.9s)]
*  Be president at the helm during the Internet Revolution and this incredible economic boom [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=895.74s)]
*  He was obviously so centrist right he appealed to both sides of the aisle and you had this very tight [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=900.98s)]
*  Consensus that the economy was good [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=908.98s)]
*  Democrats were maybe three or four percentage points above Republicans in that perception and then Bush came in and all of a sudden Democrats [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=911.42s)]
*  Hated Bush so much that they perceived the same economy [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=918.62s)]
*  2000 and you obviously have the dot-com bus there. So they both went down in unison [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=923.22s)]
*  especially after the Great Recession, but you have this [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=928.22s)]
*  Disparity that comes up Chamath where you have 25 points between how they perceive it Obama obviously [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=932.5s)]
*  Democrats were incredibly enthusiastic about Obama effusive even but [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=939.66s)]
*  Republicans hated him with a passion right and that was really when Fox News started to get cooking and then you look at Trump same [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=945.22s)]
*  exact phenomenon it flips [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=951.74s)]
*  under Trump 80% of [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=953.9s)]
*  Republicans think how the economy is good and then Democrats [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=957.62s)]
*  Say it's it's not good and that plummets and you get this big dispersion. There are two moments in time free Berg where [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=961.58s)]
*  Or three when you start to see the consensus get tighter and that's during a crash [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=967.82s)]
*  There's a dot-com crash great in an election crisis and an election. Yeah, and great. That's a very good point [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=972.2s)]
*  Actually, I didn't notice that and then also during the pandemic. So you have three. Yeah, this is a great chart [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=978.24s)]
*  Yeah, so free Berg, you know looking at this. I think it explains so much of the the the tension in the country [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=982.5600000000001s)]
*  That we can't even agree on you know, hey is the economy good? It's just everything is perceived through your partisan lens [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=990.48s)]
*  What's your takeaway from this is that we just don't run moderates anymore like Clinton [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=997.1400000000001s)]
*  Um, well look, I mean at the end of the day if people feel like they're progressing [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1003.12s)]
*  They feel happier. They feel like they're not progressing. They're unhappy regardless of their absolute state [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1007.72s)]
*  You know, we talked about this with with Jonathan Haight on our interview show. We talked about this on the show in the past. I [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1012.5200000000001s)]
*  Think that there's some studies that show that if income growth is not roughly 10% a year [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1018.4000000000001s)]
*  You get an unhappiness indicator and then there are other associations with that like am I improving the size of my house? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1024.64s)]
*  I'm able to buy a new car [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1030.88s)]
*  Am I able to like progress in my career and make more money? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1031.96s)]
*  all these factors kind of play in and much of this ends up being buoyed by [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1034.96s)]
*  The the political ideology of the candidate that's in the office and how they are popularizing [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1039.8000000000002s)]
*  What they are doing to help you progress even if you are or are not actually progressing [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1045.88s)]
*  So then people hear the political leadership say this is what we're doing [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1050.5200000000002s)]
*  You associate that as being positive or negative if you're a Republican or you're a Democrat you associate it as one or the other [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1055.68s)]
*  And so you have this perception of progression without actually having economic progression be tied to it [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1061.16s)]
*  So the reality is gets decoupled. So I think it's a you know, it's an excellent chart to kind of highlight that that fact [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1067.82s)]
*  I'm not sure how much it ties to this inflationary issue that we're dealing with right now [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1073.96s)]
*  But I will tell you that and I'll restate this again [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1077.76s)]
*  Much of the inflation like I think grocery prices are up 30 plus percent Nick [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1082.08s)]
*  You could probably pull this up since Kovac. That is you're correct one of the sticky points [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1085.6799999999998s)]
*  You know because this CPI you have to parse it like you're saying and groceries. Yeah [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1090.56s)]
*  Globalized the more globalized the businesses are that are providing the goods or services to us [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1097.1999999999998s)]
*  The more likely they are to need to hike prices to make up for the inflationary cost structure in their business because of their global [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1101.82s)]
*  Presence you want to hear an interesting factoid? Yes, please [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1108.76s)]
*  There's an article in Bloomberg. I sent it to Nick, but people have been tracking the S&P 500 index [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1113.04s)]
*  Versus the equal weighted index. So when you calculate the S&P 500 index you wait it for the market cap [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1120.2s)]
*  So the top seven or eight companies obviously get a lot more weight in it [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1126.36s)]
*  And so they look at the spread between that index and an equal weighted index where every 500 companies are you know? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1130.14s)]
*  The 500 companies are each equal and what's interesting is the spread right now is the most extreme [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1138.12s)]
*  Since March of 2000 right before the top [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1147.7199999999998s)]
*  Well, this is Bloomberg's data, so I'm just repeating it I just I read that article but that's incredible [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1153.6s)]
*  It's a tie-in to the AI thing. I guess that we're gonna talk about soon, but next year [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1159.1599999999999s)]
*  We could be at the end of just an enormous hype cycle here where we have to contract the equity market [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1164.24s)]
*  That's probably not a bad thing by the way [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1170.5600000000002s)]
*  because as sac said one of the things that you have to do is I think you have to underwrite to a rate of return and [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1172.68s)]
*  right now nobody knows really what to do because [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1177.8400000000001s)]
*  Valuations would tell you that you should price to the low end [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1182.24s)]
*  But then it's not really clear what the risk-free rate of return should be [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1185.92s)]
*  So everybody's just sort of like they're there they're there shrugging in their arms are in the air [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1191.26s)]
*  And nobody knows what to do [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1196.4599999999998s)]
*  So if you really want to get the economy moving at some point, you're gonna have to reset something [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1197.98s)]
*  You're gonna have to reset rates or you're gonna have to set the equity risk premium in the stock market [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1203.6999999999998s)]
*  You're gonna have to reset people's expectations around whether but what is actually happening in the economy and right now [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1209.98s)]
*  We're in this limbo where none of those things have been decided, but there are all of these weird [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1216.1799999999998s)]
*  Moments like data points that you could use to kind of just justify your bias quite honestly [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1221.6599999999999s)]
*  But the point is that I think there's a lot of question marks right now. Not a lot of answers. Yeah that [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1228.78s)]
*  phenomenon you're talking about [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1234.9399999999998s)]
*  previously is [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1237.1s)]
*  relative deprivation [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1238.82s)]
*  Freebird it's a phenomenon where you compare yourself to other people. You feel like I I'm getting screwed here [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1240.9399999999998s)]
*  Sax what's your take on? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1247.98s)]
*  This AI bubble because we get some data I'm about to pull up on it, but let's just get there right now how much of this [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1250.7s)]
*  Boom that we're seeing in the stock market is this AI [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1259.18s)]
*  Bubble [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1263.98s)]
*  Well, a lot of the boom is driven by these AI stocks notably in video [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1265.3s)]
*  I mean if you take out the AI stocks, I'm not sure the market is or maybe it's up a little bit [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1269.34s)]
*  I mean a huge part of the the gain is from these top five top seven tech stocks [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1274.7s)]
*  Is it a bubble? I think that's going a little too far. I mean, I personally think the AI wave is real [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1279.98s)]
*  I think the question is whether the level of investment that we're seeing going into cloud service infrastructure is sustainable [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1285.98s)]
*  There's a huge build out happening right now many many billions of dollars building out these [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1293.78s)]
*  new [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1300.18s)]
*  cloud service centers or cloud infrastructure data centers data centers based on GPUs instead of CPUs and [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1301.46s)]
*  I think it's a good question about whether that's sustainable [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1308.06s)]
*  I do think that one of the things that's going on is that the chips are really expensive [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1311.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean these GPUs from Nvidia what they're like $30,000. Yeah per GPU [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1316.3s)]
*  Right and part of the reason for that is the scarcity [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1322.26s)]
*  They haven't been able to produce as much as there's demand for and so they're commanding a premium right now [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1324.98s)]
*  And just to be clear, they're not just a chip. I mean people think they're like a chip [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1329.74s)]
*  They think something you hold in the palm of your hand. They're like a racked server. That's like [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1332.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's got like thousands of components and it's a very complicated product to make [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1337.82s)]
*  In any event, they're very expensive and so it's very expensive to build out this new infrastructure [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1341.74s)]
*  I do think that over time the price of these chips just has to come down [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1348.0s)]
*  It doesn't make sense that they'd be so expensive just as [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1351.9399999999998s)]
*  Production increases and they don't have this rate limit on the supply [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1355.5s)]
*  Then I think the price should come down and the cost of this infrastructure should normalize a bit [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1360.34s)]
*  Well, and you heard it here first on the all-in-pot here's episode 181 six weeks ago [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1364.62s)]
*  No, Shrek Anis wasn't involved in this one, but here's to Moth and Freebird [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1370.1s)]
*  You cannot spend this kind of money and show no incremental revenue potential. So while this is [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1374.5s)]
*  Incredible for Nvidia [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1380.4599999999998s)]
*  The chicken is coming home to roost because if you do not start seeing revenue flow to the bottom line of these companies that are [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1382.4199999999998s)]
*  Spending $26 billion a quarter the market cap of Nvidia is not what the market cap of Nvidia should be and all of these other companies [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1389.86s)]
*  Are going to get punished for spending this kind of money [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1396.46s)]
*  Where are all these newfangled things that we're supposed to see that justifies a hundred billion dollars of chip spend a year [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1398.98s)]
*  200 billion dollars of energy spend a hundred billion dollars of all this other stuff. We're not spending 750 billion dollars [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1406.34s)]
*  This is on the order of a [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1413.72s)]
*  national [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1416.3s)]
*  Transfer payment and we've seen nothing to show for it except that you can mimic somebody's voice [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1417.82s)]
*  It doesn't all hang together yet [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1423.26s)]
*  you know the general statement might be made that perhaps the first AI mini bubble is bursting a bit and [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1425.82s)]
*  particularly with respect to the accelerated expectations that public market investors had for public market technology stocks that [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1433.1799999999998s)]
*  Perhaps now is the time for a bit of a reckoning that perhaps this isn't going to happen at the same margin level [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1440.54s)]
*  Or the pace that folks had modeled correct and this is going to cause a bit of a setback [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1445.5s)]
*  And so I think inspired in part by that David Khan from Sequoia Capital legendary venture firm here in Silicon Valley [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1449.58s)]
*  Published a blog titled AI six hundred billion dollar question [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1457.4199999999998s)]
*  Khan said there was a five hundred billion dollar revenue hole when considering AI cap X levels [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1462.18s)]
*  He got this number by calculating that companies need to show around six hundred billion in AI revenue to justify [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1468.5s)]
*  Projected cap X levels in q4 and he generally assumes Google Microsoft Apple meta Tesla and others will generate [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1473.98s)]
*  Hundred billion annually combined. That's pretty generous and that still leaves a five hundred billion dollar hole [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1482.02s)]
*  Here's the Nvidia data center run rate revenue as you can see q4 of twenty twenty three fifty [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1488.38s)]
*  billion and now 150 billion and then you have the [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1495.6200000000001s)]
*  Data center facilities being built and the cost operate those implied data center AI spend and then of course your software margin [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1500.3799999999999s)]
*  Khan said he also thinks that the GPU shortage already peaked last year. We'll get to that later on [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1506.3s)]
*  June 25th a couple weeks ago Goldman published a 31 page report called gen AI too much spend too little benefits [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1512.9799999999998s)]
*  So you heard it here first on the all in pod and I think everybody's kind of catching up with this theme [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1520.78s)]
*  Companies are gonna spend one trillion according to the report on AI cap X over the next several years [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1525.6999999999998s)]
*  Usually that's three to five and we use the word several AI productivity gains are limited in the near to midterm the next ten [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1532.34s)]
*  Years and AI's ROI is likely significantly limited due to costs the cost of AI are so high and the road bridges so unclear [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1538.4199999999998s)]
*  That's a chance the economics never makes sense [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1545.9399999999998s)]
*  Here's a choice quote and then I'll get the reaction from the team [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1549.1799999999998s)]
*  Replacing low-wage jobs with tremendously costly technology is basically the polar opposite of the prior technology [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1552.5s)]
*  Transitions I've witnessed in my 30 years of closely following the tech industry and that's Goldman's head of global equity research [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1558.66s)]
*  It's an interesting concept here to mouth that you're saying like hey making like fun images or you know, maybe [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1565.54s)]
*  Rewriting your blog post, but that's low. That's low wage work. So what are your thoughts on? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1572.66s)]
*  This report these two reports you well [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1578.82s)]
*  I think we're all converging on the same realization which is you can't spend a trillion dollars and [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1581.26s)]
*  Only have toy apps to show for it. So I think we've all been amazed by these AI demos [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1587.1s)]
*  I think the four of us have talked pretty incessantly about it now for [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1593.82s)]
*  18 plus months ever since we saw the first opening I demos so that's great and the underlying technology [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1598.3s)]
*  I think is really important, but it's also [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1605.1399999999999s)]
*  Important to acknowledge that the underlying technology has enormous gaps [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1608.98s)]
*  there's gaps in the [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1613.1s)]
*  Quality of the products that can be created to not have hallucinations [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1616.1399999999999s)]
*  Those gaps are too large right now for them to be used reliably in production settings unless you have a very defined scope [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1621.78s)]
*  If you have a defined scope though [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1630.1s)]
*  The implementation costs are not nearly what needs the level of spend to support [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1632.6999999999998s)]
*  so there's just a big mismatch second is that we have a huge problem with Nvidia and I'll just [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1638.4199999999998s)]
*  kind of say the quiet part out loud which is you can't spend this kind of money to have technology lock-in to one hardware vendor and [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1644.34s)]
*  That makes no sense. And what you're seeing now is that Amazon Google Microsoft AMD Intel a plethora of startups grok [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1652.58s)]
*  Everybody trying to make now different hardware solutions [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1661.4s)]
*  the problem though that that creates is that we have this massive lock-in right now because [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1665.04s)]
*  The code is littered with all these Nvidia specific ways of implementing access to GPUs. That's not sustainable [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1669.24s)]
*  So we have a we're in a bit of an existential thrash [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1676.64s)]
*  And I think the only way that we're going to get around this is to do a little bit of a reset [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1679.72s)]
*  And I think that's going to touch a lot of startups that have already taken down way too much money at [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1684.8s)]
*  really insane valuations [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1690.1399999999999s)]
*  part of that was just because we needed I guess the market wanted a [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1692.7s)]
*  place to believe in again after the crypto meltdown and after all of the other SAS meltdown and [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1697.34s)]
*  All of the other stuff that we've gone through. So [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1703.46s)]
*  Yeah, I think that we are in a bit of a reckoning right now. It's going to be a complicated [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1706.26s)]
*  Couple of quarters to at a minimum and probably a complicated year to sort out who's actually real [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1712.26s)]
*  It's interesting psychological phenomenon there Freiburg of [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1717.2199999999998s)]
*  The capital alligators the tech industry the entrepreneurs they want to believe in something and you know [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1721.1799999999998s)]
*  the previous paradigm shifts were ending and here we go new paradigm shift perhaps we're such a [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1726.1399999999999s)]
*  efficient capitalistic [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1732.54s)]
*  Machine now that we we we almost like process stuff super quickly in some ways free Berg [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1734.4599999999998s)]
*  You know, we we deploy massive capital. We try to solve huge problems [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1740.08s)]
*  I mean and then maybe we hit the reckoning and the trow of despair that we talked about, you know many times [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1744.42s)]
*  innovators dilemma [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1750.94s)]
*  You know, you know crossing the chasm kind of style. So what are your thoughts on? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1753.0600000000002s)]
*  Shematz point there or any other points you might have there's a cold hard truth here. Okay, which is there is a ton of capital [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1756.7800000000002s)]
*  that was raised during the kovat bubble era and [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1764.46s)]
*  the Zerp era that needed a place to go and [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1768.5s)]
*  And a lot of the traditional [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1771.6599999999999s)]
*  Businesses traditional business models traditional in the technology sense SAS and a lot of the biotech stuff. It all became apps [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1774.9799999999998s)]
*  It became uninvestable then there's a lot of money in the public markets that was sitting on the sidelines that was sitting in treasuries [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1782.26s)]
*  And so on so every dollar is looking for growth and there's a lot of dollars still sitting around out there [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1788.1799999999998s)]
*  From the the Zerp era and coming into this kind of post-Zerp era [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1793.62s)]
*  Looking for a place for growth and there is very little growth as we talked about with the s&p 493 [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1797.78s)]
*  not being very performative with respect to growth and revenue and [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1803.42s)]
*  Having great outlook for the next five years. So then when there is a glimmer of upside, there's a glimmer of opportunity [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1807.5s)]
*  Even if it's just painting a picture of a growth story all the capital drives into it and we've all heard stories [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1813.5s)]
*  About the series a startups in AI [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1820.34s)]
*  Getting bid up to a hundred million dollar [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1823.1000000000001s)]
*  valuation and I've seen a couple of these where people have pitched me things on like protein modeling AI startups and it's literally like [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1825.6200000000001s)]
*  two guys from [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1831.6200000000001s)]
*  Meta and open AI that left and started this company and they get they raised 30 on a 120 pre or something and it's just two [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1832.8600000000001s)]
*  guys building a model and [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1838.54s)]
*  That's because that capital needs to find a place where it can tell itself a growth story [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1840.22s)]
*  and so I think that we're still dealing with the [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1844.02s)]
*  Capital hangover from Zerp and the fact that there's a dearth of areas to invest for real growth [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1846.96s)]
*  That has allowed the AI bubble to kind of grow as quickly as it has and now as tomorrow points out [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1851.92s)]
*  We are kind of rationalizing that back and I do think that there's gonna be a reset now [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1857.72s)]
*  I'll also say that the Goldman report which I read and some of the other analyses that have been done [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1861.68s)]
*  I think there was some commentary or some analysis that hey it costs me six times as much as having an analysts do this work [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1866.4s)]
*  Like the the the energy cost of the AI is still so high the actual performance of the model is not good [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1873.04s)]
*  But what that fails to write it's right and wrong [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1878.2s)]
*  It's right in the sense that yes [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1880.52s)]
*  It is more expensive today and the return on investment is not there today [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1882.16s)]
*  It's wrong in that it ignores the performative model improvements that we're seeing in [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1885.68s)]
*  Nearly any metric over the past couple of months every few months as we know we see new models new improvements new architectures new ways [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1891.3600000000001s)]
*  Of leveraging the chips to actually drive a lower token cost to drive lower energy cost per answer [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1898.64s)]
*  Lower energy cost per run and so every metric that matters is improving [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1905.88s)]
*  So if you fast forward another 24 36 months [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1910.0200000000002s)]
*  I do think that there's a great reason to be optimistic that there's gonna be extraordinary ROI [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1912.8000000000002s)]
*  Based on the infrastructure that's being built [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1917.8400000000001s)]
*  It's a question of are you gonna get payback before the next cycle of infrastructure needs to be made and everything comes back in [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1920.0s)]
*  We saw this during the dot-com boom where a lot of people built out data centers and by the time they were actually able to [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1925.04s)]
*  Make money on those data centers. It was like hey all the new telco equipment [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1929.72s)]
*  All the new servers need to be put in and everything got written off [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1932.76s)]
*  So there is a big capex kind of question mark here [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1935.36s)]
*  But I do think that the fundamental economics of AI will be proven over the next couple of quarters [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1937.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I I don't I don't think it's going to be the next couple quarters quite honestly [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1942.32s)]
*  I do think in the next couple of decades and in the next couple of years what I would hope ambitiously is that there are a few [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1946.4s)]
*  Really useful [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1954.2s)]
*  Proof points where companies are making revenues solving very specific defined problems [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1955.88s)]
*  Where quite honestly you're taking workloads of X and making it X over 10, right? And I think that that's possible [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1961.68s)]
*  But I think this generalized idea that all of this spend is gonna have a good ROI. I think is pretty wishful thinking [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1969.48s)]
*  Actually want to maybe give you sure thoughts here [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1976.0s)]
*  Bubble do we work our way out of it are we overspending or is this all manifest destiny? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1979.48s)]
*  You know, if you build it they will come kind of situation. We throw all this capital there. We make a lot of [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1984.84s)]
*  Progress on these projects and something comes out the other end as messy as it is [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1990.88s)]
*  I think that's what's likely to happen. I'm much more bullish than you guys about this investment that's being made [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=1995.4s)]
*  Remember that when the internet got started in the 90s, it was via dial-up [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2000.96s)]
*  I mean you literally had to have a modem and you would dial up the internet and it was incredibly slow [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2005.74s)]
*  photo-sharing didn't even work so social networking wasn't possible and [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2010.78s)]
*  basically what happened next was that the telecom companies spent a ton of money building out broadband and [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2016.14s)]
*  People started upgrading to broadband then we had the dot-com crash. Everyone thought that telecom companies had wasted billions of dollars [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2023.3s)]
*  Investing in all this broadband infrastructure and it turned out that no they were right to do that [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2030.42s)]
*  it just took a while for for that to get used and [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2035.7s)]
*  This is a pretty common pattern with technological revolutions [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2039.74s)]
*  Is that you can have a bubble in the short term? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2043.1399999999999s)]
*  But then it gets justified in the mid to long term that build out of the railroads in the United States [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2045.6s)]
*  Another example of this we had huge railroad bubbles, but it turned out that that investment was all worthwhile [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2051.94s)]
*  So I turn I think this was gonna happen with AI. I mean, I do think that there's already [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2058.2599999999998s)]
*  Enough let's call it realness to the applications. I mean, I'll give you three examples number one open AI [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2062.9s)]
*  I mean open AI is [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2068.7799999999997s)]
*  Effectively semantic search, right? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2071.7799999999997s)]
*  It's a different kind of search engine where it understands the question you're asking and gives you an answer [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2073.7s)]
*  Instead of blue links and they're already at was it we probably previously three point four billion [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2079.46s)]
*  Now that's a consumer at 20 bucks and enterprise at like 30 bucks a month and then there's also the API [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2084.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so you could turn it already [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2091.62s)]
*  I mean this is this company's only been around for two years with a product on the market and it's doubling year over year [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2093.42s)]
*  So that's example number one, right? I mean, what's the most valuable application on the internet until now? It's been Google, right? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2099.14s)]
*  And so search and so you have a different kind of search now that I'm not saying it's a one-for-one replacement [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2105.8s)]
*  It's also a new market [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2112.46s)]
*  But my point is just you already have a very powerful application in the form of this semantic search [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2113.46s)]
*  Which open AI is currently dominating the second one. I think will be when Apple comes out with iPhone 16 [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2119.02s)]
*  you know with [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2125.1s)]
*  LLM powered Siri assuming they do a decent job with that. I [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2126.86s)]
*  It's gonna lead to a huge upgrade cycle [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2131.3s)]
*  I mean, I'm still on an iPhone 13 because I haven't seen a reason to upgrade [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2133.58s)]
*  I will definitely upgrade to the SNAP upgrade for that assuming [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2136.2200000000003s)]
*  That they roll their own LLM and use that to power Syria and don't give my data to a third party LLM and there's [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2142.46s)]
*  Been mixed reports about trust Sam Altman with your [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2149.62s)]
*  With your iPhone backup. I don't want Apple sharing any of my data [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2152.7400000000002s)]
*  which they obtained by being the operating system with a third party LLM, but a [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2157.5s)]
*  bunch of viewers of the show posts in the comments that I had made a mistake on this and that [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2163.2200000000003s)]
*  Apple was rolling its own LLM to power Syria and they would only go to open AI during a [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2168.1800000000003s)]
*  if [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2174.98s)]
*  Their own LLM can't do it for some reason. I'm just gonna turn that feature off [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2176.46s)]
*  But but in any event so assuming Apple gets that right everyone's gonna upgrade their iPhones [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2180.94s)]
*  the third app is look, you know, we're using LLMs to power glue and [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2186.38s)]
*  The results aren't always [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2192.26s)]
*  Consistently awesome I would say the results are kind of like a B plus right now, but you do get some [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2195.1000000000004s)]
*  Really great results, you know, it's a strong start for you. It's a strong start [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2201.82s)]
*  Yeah, and you know in a year or so we're gonna be at the next-gen [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2206.0200000000004s)]
*  Version of all the models you're gonna be at I'm sure [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2210.6200000000003s)]
*  You know chat GPT-5 will be out and then yep the next version of Claude and so forth at that point [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2213.5s)]
*  It's gonna be an a-plus and I gotta tell you I've been using Claude and chat GPT-4 Oh and it is extraordinary [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2219.16s)]
*  How fast they fixed going to the web to get information? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2227.2s)]
*  It used to be arduous and painful to get updated information. And so I was like hey get me all of these [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2230.72s)]
*  The I think I've told this story previously here on this week in startups [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2237.72s)]
*  But I was talking about like I was doing research on salaries [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2241.48s)]
*  And I said just grant me all the information from Glassdoor indeed high salary low salary average salary these two different cities [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2244.0s)]
*  Put it in a table and give me the links and it did it and I was like that's like a college education [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2250.16s)]
*  educated person's job [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2256.92s)]
*  For 40 bucks an hour call it whatever it is a 60 70 80 thousand dollar a person [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2258.64s)]
*  so I'm in the bullish cap with you socks and I [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2263.04s)]
*  Think it's being over belt sure [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2266.44s)]
*  But I think we're gonna see a tipping point next year where a lot of labor arbitrage occurs and [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2268.6s)]
*  what I mean by that is like you people are figuring out ways to [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2275.64s)]
*  Cut jobs or have one person do three jobs and I'm seeing it across all the startups [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2280.16s)]
*  we invest in I'm seeing it with Athena the company we invested in I mentioned earlier and [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2284.96s)]
*  I'm really interested in robotics now, too. I think there's gonna be some incredible gains [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2290.36s)]
*  With optimists and some of the other robots that are occurring and those things are only going to cost 20 grand [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2295.52s)]
*  So it's this is gonna be pretty I think I think the low-hanging fruit [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2299.92s)]
*  application wise in the enterprise is [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2304.8s)]
*  Chat with a knowledge base chat with your knowledge basis. That's what people want, right? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2307.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and we're still in the early stages of being able to connect your enterprise data to an LLM in a safe [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2311.8s)]
*  Compliant way that's where a lot of activity is happening right now and the compliant part means [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2319.28s)]
*  You're working in the tech guys for the marketing group and you don't guys [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2325.08s)]
*  You know search the HR departments data. Yeah guys. Let me ask you just a general question though [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2329.56s)]
*  Okay, like we've spent a trillion dollars [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2334.84s)]
*  Let's say that there's forward purchasing commits for let's be generous and say only half that number. So now there's 1.5 trillion [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2338.04s)]
*  So we're 1.5 trillion dollars in the j-curve. How much total revenue does the entire? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2345.2400000000002s)]
*  AI economy that's established today need to generate to pay that back plus some reasonable rate of return revenue [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2351.0s)]
*  had a fair multiple and and I think what I'm getting to is [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2358.16s)]
*  Open AI is a good example of a company that's winning [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2362.9199999999996s)]
*  But unless they somehow figure out a way to start making 50 billion dollars [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2366.08s)]
*  There's another 47 billion dollars of revenue that's missing. That's my point. Yeah, I think they get there. I'm totally honest and I [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2369.72s)]
*  Watch I'm saying I'm just saying that's like just for the last couple years of spent. Yeah, I [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2376.88s)]
*  Mean there's so much dry powder sitting around at these large companies [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2382.84s)]
*  I think capital is a weapon kind of situation, but it could be a big that's a different explanation [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2386.6800000000003s)]
*  Which is we can just take the rate of return to zero because we have nothing better to do with the money [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2392.0s)]
*  That's a fair answer as well. Jason. Yeah, I mean, what are they gonna do give a dividend? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2396.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean god forbid right like I mean Facebook started giving one apples given one [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2400.6400000000003s)]
*  So maybe you know, I think that's how they can't do M&A because Alina Khan [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2405.28s)]
*  Yeah [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2408.84s)]
*  I think where I think Jamal has a point is that these big tech companies are not [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2409.36s)]
*  Building out all this infrastructure because they've modeled out the ROI and it's extremely positive. They're doing it because it's an arms race [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2414.36s)]
*  It's so strategic right now to have these AI capabilities and to power the expected next generation of AI apps [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2421.2000000000003s)]
*  They can't afford to let one of their competitors have that they have to compete [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2427.8s)]
*  So they're all in an arm's race with each other bidding up the cost of these GPUs because they have to have that supply [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2431.7999999999997s)]
*  It's like nukes. It's like nukes. You never use them. You built them out [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2437.96s)]
*  It might be the good well, I think they're gonna use them [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2440.8799999999997s)]
*  But yeah, the point is that it's a zero-sum game. And if I let you have this GPU, I have one less GPU to use [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2443.2799999999997s)]
*  What do you think of the Andreessen this article that Andreessen just turned on 20,000 GPUs? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2451.04s)]
*  To your point it was reported earlier this week that Andreessen Horowitz [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2456.24s)]
*  That's a very large venture capital firm here in the Bay Area is building a 20,000 GPU cluster [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2459.44s)]
*  We mentioned earlier twenty thirty thousand dollars a GPU is what you can estimate there [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2465.16s)]
*  So this is hundreds of millions of dollars to try to cut deals and win deals with AI startups [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2468.96s)]
*  And so they they stole this idea from Daniel Rose, which you probably don't know who that is [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2474.8399999999997s)]
*  But it's a company called pioneer labs and not Friedman from github [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2479.8399999999997s)]
*  They did this last year same exact idea [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2484.2799999999997s)]
*  they they acquired 2500 h100s and they gave their portfolio companies access to it in something called the [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2487.3599999999997s)]
*  Andromeda cluster really brilliant idea. There's a tweet from Nat [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2493.9599999999996s)]
*  It's not clear whether a 16 is purchasing these or they're just gonna pay for them on AWS or [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2498.64s)]
*  Google Cloud or some other provider, but if these were purchased obviously hundreds of millions of dollars, what's your thought here? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2506.2799999999997s)]
*  I won't go through all the details. I'll just go right to your opinion tomorrow. What's your thought on this? [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2513.56s)]
*  Yeah, a friend of mine who's a very successful debt fund manager [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2517.0s)]
*  And I talked about it this week friend of the pod. I won't [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2523.04s)]
*  Name check him, but he knows who he is [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2527.0s)]
*  Was and I am we're talking about this and basically I think if you look at the the most [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2529.08s)]
*  Typical deal so like for example, the the core weave deal which was floating around was something along the lines of [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2534.36s)]
*  40% of the cost of all the GPUs was put up in cash and 60% was lent to core weave by [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2541.4s)]
*  A whole group of bankers. So if assuming Andreessen was able to do roughly the same thing [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2547.48s)]
*  the 20,000 GPU cluster at call it say 20 to 30,000 is between 4 and 600 million of cost and [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2552.92s)]
*  If they get 60% of the finance [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2560.44s)]
*  I hope they did that still leaves 40% that they would have had to pay for which you're still talking about [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2562.54s)]
*  A hundred million dollars plus and so then the real question is can they get enough equity back? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2569.12s)]
*  To make that hundred million dollar investment worthwhile and just to put a fine point on this if that's a hundred million of management fees [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2576.44s)]
*  The reality is that that's actually two billion dollars of value, right? [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2584.02s)]
*  Because these these management companies trade at call it say 20 odd times [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2587.86s)]
*  So what's so interesting about this is like you take a hundred million of management fee [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2591.68s)]
*  That's worth two billion of enterprise value you dump it into these chips and cash [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2596.4s)]
*  So whatever equity you get from these startups will need to make about two billion dollars [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2600.96s)]
*  Plus a little bit to account for the the time value of money [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2606.08s)]
*  Otherwise, you were probably better off not doing this. That's just the math. I wonder if this is [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2610.52s)]
*  The 20 times math only makes sense if it's a hundred million a year in perpetuity [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2615.12s)]
*  All right, if it's a one-time spend on the hundred million, then it's just a hundred million [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2620.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, you also have to power these you have to put them in a data center [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2624.08s)]
*  There's a lot of cost to these a lot of ongoing costs. Yeah a lot of ongoing costs [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2627.0s)]
*  So let's just say they'll spend that another 20 or 30 million over the next 10 years [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2630.3199999999997s)]
*  My point is it's a drag on your enterprise value [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2634.4s)]
*  That's probably in the billion plus dollar range [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2637.2s)]
*  And so whatever equity you get needs to make up for that plus some and my only comment is that if you then factor in [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2639.4s)]
*  Saks as you said before the desire to get these Nvidia chips [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2647.36s)]
*  Down in price but also to have hardware diversity [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2651.96s)]
*  It's a really speculative bet and you have to be really right. It's also a crazy [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2656.2400000000002s)]
*  Conflicted bet too because Nvidia was using these chips in the same fashion [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2661.88s)]
*  They were using allocations to get investment allocations in companies and then paying them off [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2665.94s)]
*  So now you have Andreessen buying them from Nvidia. It's also convoluted [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2671.82s)]
*  Amazon was doing this as well with AWS giving credits, etc. So tried and true strategy, but very strange [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2676.26s)]
*  I don't think it's that weird a strategy [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2682.2200000000003s)]
*  Because I mean look it's definitely because [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2685.7400000000002s)]
*  They're giving money to Nvidia. I don't think you need to do this to build a successful venture firm [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2688.82s)]
*  I mean, you want to maximize the value of the entity [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2693.42s)]
*  You would keep the hundred million for yourself because then some investor will pay you a huge multiple for that [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2696.7400000000002s)]
*  You know what I'm saying is is that they they're buying these chips and then they're effectively time sharing them out to [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2701.8199999999997s)]
*  To portfolio companies and so they're gonna charge for their use. They're gonna amortize this cost [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2707.8599999999997s)]
*  They're gonna charge back. You think they're gonna charge back the startups [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2713.8999999999996s)]
*  I'm just saying you have to see a path to make back what you're losing an enterprise value. I think this is brilliant for [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2717.7s)]
*  Year 0 1 2 like Pioneer Labs was doing because those people really don't have the money if you're a viable concern [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2723.58s)]
*  You can easily get the money to buy your own or rent your own [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2730.62s)]
*  And we just said in the previous story that the glut and the weight is over for these. So interesting [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2733.94s)]
*  It depends on the rate of depreciation [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2739.4s)]
*  If you buy these chips at a premium because they're scarce right now and then all of a sudden they rapidly depreciate in value [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2741.4s)]
*  Then you might lose money on the other hand if the current value the investor remains stable because they don't depreciate that rapidly and then [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2747.2799999999997s)]
*  You can charge the cost back to the startups who are using the chips [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2753.74s)]
*  Then you know you break even excellent point, yeah, and it's basically a business development expense [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2757.3799999999997s)]
*  Marketing this is a PR marketing exercise and it worked well done mark as we're talking about [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2765.8599999999997s)]
*  I mean, I think it's kind of interesting. I think they've gotten a hundred million in marketing of it [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2772.2599999999998s)]
*  Just yeah, I mean look it appeals to a certain category of startup who needs the GPUs [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2776.4199999999996s)]
*  I mean just to be clear like there's lots of AI applications that don't need [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2780.8199999999997s)]
*  Direct access to GPUs because you know, for example, we're using the Claude models or using the open AI [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2785.5s)]
*  You're using the language model API. So it's abstract. We need them. Yeah, we don't deal with GP [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2791.3s)]
*  I mean you have to be in the model business effectively to need direct access the GPUs as we wrap up here today [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2796.38s)]
*  Freeburg your thoughts and you had mentioned in the group chat last minute addition to the docket you wanted to talk about the French [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2802.78s)]
*  collections and I know Saks was [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2809.78s)]
*  Tweeting about it because all the people who hate him were sending it to me [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2812.38s)]
*  So he's not when he tweets about something spicy [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2816.7000000000003s)]
*  Gaffrey Burke, what do you got? There was effectively a [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2819.6600000000003s)]
*  center and left alignment that [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2822.98s)]
*  created kind of a surprise upset to the [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2826.5400000000004s)]
*  right that was surging in the polls leading into the selection in France and as we all saw there was a lot of [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2830.1400000000003s)]
*  Celebration in the streets and some rioting and so on [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2836.7000000000003s)]
*  But it was a real kind of surprise ship left in this kind of important vote that happened in France and then [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2839.66s)]
*  The party stepped up and put forward these economic proposals [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2845.98s)]
*  they said a 90% tax on income over 400,000 euro a year a [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2848.94s)]
*  14% mandatory wage increase or time and age needs to be reduced to the age of 60 from 64 [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2852.8999999999996s)]
*  which obviously massively increases social spending and [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2858.66s)]
*  That they want to put forward proposals to put in place price controls on things like food electricity gas and petrol [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2861.3799999999997s)]
*  So effectively intervening in kind of the free market pricing system last month in India [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2867.74s)]
*  We also saw elections where the BJP did not get a majority in Mexico [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2874.4199999999996s)]
*  We saw shine bomb get elected with 60% of the vote retaining the leftist government [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2878.4599999999996s)]
*  shine bombs platform [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2883.66s)]
*  Is that the government's role is to really solve the economic inequality kind of throughout the country? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2885.8599999999997s)]
*  She is a Jewish scientist who believes in technological progress, but her orientation is really around having [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2892.58s)]
*  Institutions manage progress not individuals in free markets [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2898.34s)]
*  We've seen this broad across other places in the UK [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2902.26s)]
*  There was a big election in this past week [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2905.8s)]
*  But I wanted to take a step back and just highlight that [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2907.48s)]
*  There is this kind of emerging tactical alliance that we've seen repeat a few times between the left and the center that pushes back [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2910.2200000000003s)]
*  Against the right globally, but really what I think we're seeing is a much bigger shift [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2916.26s)]
*  Where there's this bigger battle between socialism and free market democracy? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2921.86s)]
*  and I think that [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2926.1s)]
*  we're seeing it all happen at once because of globalism and [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2928.1400000000003s)]
*  Because of the fact that globalism has enabled just like we've seen manifest in the United States [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2933.86s)]
*  massive and significant economic progress [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2940.5s)]
*  But at the cost of a small number of people becoming very wealthy and a large number of people feeling left behind as a result [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2943.6200000000003s)]
*  of the wealth accumulating in a major way to a small number of people and the reaction that we're seeing in [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2951.86s)]
*  France in India in Mexico in the US in the UK is all very much kind of [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2959.5s)]
*  Aligned that there is this big push that social lift practices can perhaps [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2966.98s)]
*  resolve the inequality and the inefficiencies that are seen in the markets today and [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2972.6200000000003s)]
*  This is being manifested in a lot of really nasty ways. First of all, I think it's rationalized as being [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2976.7400000000002s)]
*  Hey, there's economic excess for a few while the majority are left behind [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2981.86s)]
*  It's activated by big bureaucracy [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2985.38s)]
*  by anti free market principles and by tax policies and spending policies that will ultimately cripple economic growth and [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2988.1400000000003s)]
*  I don't want to say I'm against taxes because I'm all for taxes to make up for [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=2996.1800000000003s)]
*  Budget deficits, but I think the results are ultimately across all of this gonna be what we saw happen in Argentina [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3001.3s)]
*  Which I think is on the other side of this problem, which is unsustainable debt accumulation and massive inflation and [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3007.66s)]
*  crippling unemployment [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3014.3399999999997s)]
*  and I think that we should really take a hard look at what's happening around the world right now as being all related all of [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3015.46s)]
*  The industrialized world is voting in a similar way and starting to shift in a similar way [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3021.54s)]
*  That we should be fairly concerned about and pay a lot of attention to in the US [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3026.7s)]
*  There's this expectation that Trump is gonna totally trounce Biden if Biden stays in the race [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3032.06s)]
*  I think that if we see the same sort of thing happen in the US in that the psyche of people [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3038.14s)]
*  Or that we feel left behind that there's a hierarchical system that disadvantages the majority of people [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3044.8599999999997s)]
*  Because economic progress is not proportional to everyone [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3051.1s)]
*  You could end up seeing a surprise sort of voting system emerge in the US where the left may win [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3055.7799999999997s)]
*  Because socialist principles are on the rise in the psyche of the youth in the industrialized world [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3062.58s)]
*  And I'm not saying I'm making a prediction about how the elections gonna go in the US [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3067.62s)]
*  But I do think that there's a big kind of fundamental change underway here Saxe. He didn't mention [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3071.2599999999998s)]
*  Immigration specifically Muslim Islamic immigration in France. That seems to be a big part of this issue that people aren't [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3076.8199999999997s)]
*  Talking about in the lack of integration of that population into society [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3083.74s)]
*  in fact, you know, I've been told by folks in France that it's kind of the opposite like [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3089.2999999999997s)]
*  It [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3095.14s)]
*  Islamic Muslim immigrants are kind of shunned and aren't integrated by the French people themselves [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3096.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm not sure how true that is. I don't have a lot of firsthand experience in it [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3102.06s)]
*  But how much of that is part of what's happening in this right left? [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3106.02s)]
*  You know [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3110.98s)]
*  Donnybrook occurring in France because they're literally on the streets fighting and yeah, right [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3112.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3117.58s)]
*  Look, I don't think that the use demand for socialism is what's driving the results in France at all [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3117.9s)]
*  Let me explain what happened. So the the way that the voting works in France [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3124.9s)]
*  it's a you know, unusual system to our eyes where they have a first round of voting and [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3128.82s)]
*  in that first round of voting [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3135.14s)]
*  Marine Le Pen's party national rally won a strong plurality of the vote and the map looked like this where literally [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3137.46s)]
*  They won every district in the country except for Paris [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3145.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean it was a really dominant performance and so people were expecting major reform and Jake how you're right that [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3148.84s)]
*  Marine Le Pen's major issue her party is the unlimited immigration that's taking place into France [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3155.98s)]
*  The French people or a substantial portion of them are up in arms about this and actually this is something that's very common across all of Europe [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3164.1s)]
*  They're very nationalistic. Let's call it [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3171.78s)]
*  It's it they care about their culture the indigenous people of France are opposed to the seller colonial invasion [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3173.94s)]
*  That's happening from the global south and they want to preserve their French culture and society and nation as it has always been [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3181.7400000000002s)]
*  And they do not see how this unlimited immigration from the global south is good for them. It's not good for them economically [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3190.1s)]
*  It's not good for societal cohesiveness. It's not good for crime and so on [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3196.54s)]
*  This is undoubtedly a huge driver of [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3201.3s)]
*  National rally success, but then what happened is that in the French system? [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3204.6200000000003s)]
*  There's a second round of voting a week later and we got these results [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3209.54s)]
*  Where national rallies still got the plurality of the vote? [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3214.34s)]
*  They got 37 percent of the vote, but they only want 142 seats [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3217.2200000000003s)]
*  Whereas Macron's party got 22 percent of the vote 148 and then a collection of parties called the new popular front [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3222.42s)]
*  Which is basically a collection of far-left parties under the radical socialists John Luke Melon Sean [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3229.66s)]
*  Won only 27 percent of the vote but won the most seats and this is what I think freeberg's reacting to is the socialist [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3236.5s)]
*  Ended up with the most seats. Well, how did this happen if? [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3242.94s)]
*  National rally Marine Le Pen's party got a lot more votes than new popular front. The answer is that [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3246.8599999999997s)]
*  Macron [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3253.46s)]
*  president of France conspired [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3255.02s)]
*  With the far-left to have 200 candidates quit [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3257.18s)]
*  To basically drive those voters the voters and let's call the center-left [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3262.82s)]
*  Over to the far-left in order to block Marine Le Pen's party from winning the number of seats that they otherwise would have [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3267.7s)]
*  so just to recap what you're talking about they have two rounds of [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3274.98s)]
*  Elections here. They have a first round a second round [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3279.1s)]
*  if you don't win like the majority in the first round then it goes to the second round runoff and then [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3281.14s)]
*  strategically [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3286.46s)]
*  What Macron and his party did was they took the multiple parties and said hey [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3287.62s)]
*  we'll just have y'all drop out and consolidate our votes almost like in a microcosm in the United States would be like [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3291.54s)]
*  RFK giving dropping out at the last minute and saying I endorse this person on left or right [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3299.66s)]
*  So they get a very strategic thing to right but they went district by district and they basically said okay strategy [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3304.1s)]
*  Yeah, hold on in this district. We're gonna let the we're gonna have [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3310.2999999999997s)]
*  Macron's candidate drop out and endorse new popular front exactly. So that's what they did. So brilliant [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3314.74s)]
*  Well, it's a manipulated result and what it ends up with look a lot of people said it's actually you're saying that they rigged the election [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3321.96s)]
*  Look, they didn't rig the votes. Okay. I have no reason to believe that the votes aren't real [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3328.14s)]
*  But they did rig the candidates in order to frustrate the desire of the French people for reform the reform that Marine Le Pen was offering [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3331.54s)]
*  And free bird you're interpreting. This is basically a big endorsement for socialism [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3339.98s)]
*  I don't think that's what this is [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3343.94s)]
*  I think that what happened here is that the center left under Macron was willing to throw the election through legal [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3345.06s)]
*  I'm not saying they did anything illegal through legal [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3352.42s)]
*  Manipulated the candidates. Yeah, exactly. And so it's to me. It's just it's sad that you know what one person tweeted that [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3356.1s)]
*  We voted for reform. We voted for national sovereignty [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3364.1800000000003s)]
*  We voted to restrict [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3368.58s)]
*  Unlimited immigration and what we got was communism. This isn't what we voted for [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3370.94s)]
*  Right, and so it's just kind of sad that what's happening is that the system the system politicians are essentially getting together to frustrate [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3375.02s)]
*  The popular will of the people the Penn's Party [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3383.5s)]
*  Still got out voted in each of those district, right? Is that correct only because they dropped a candidate [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3387.5s)]
*  200 candidates basically were strategically dropped out in order to throw the vote in those districts [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3393.54s)]
*  So all these systems ultimately resolved to a two-party system [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3399.02s)]
*  Where some minority can hijack one of the parties to enforce their will? [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3402.62s)]
*  Ideologically, I think that's kind of my point sex [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3408.54s)]
*  I mean, you know the day after the election there was this statement on some of their economic priorities [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3411.42s)]
*  Increase the tax rate to 90% on income over 400 K drop the retirement age from 64 to 60 [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3418.34s)]
*  I mean, you know you go down the list, you know putting in price controls on [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3424.78s)]
*  You know free market services and products and goods. This is a lot of what we're seeing kind of repeated in a in a bunch of different ways [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3429.7000000000003s)]
*  It's all the same story with different characters all over the industrialized world about that part [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3437.1800000000003s)]
*  So so basically on the on the heels of this vote with New Popular Front winning all these seats [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3441.78s)]
*  John Luke Melochon gives this speech in which he you know rails basically against McCrone's [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3447.1s)]
*  Neoliberal policies he wants to go back to the restricted number of hours in the workweek [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3453.66s)]
*  He wants a 90% wealth tax and so on across the board [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3458.14s)]
*  He does want radical socialism and he says that he will not cooperate with McCrone's party [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3461.9799999999996s)]
*  So, I mean this is like just it's almost [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3467.8599999999997s)]
*  Cartoonish and clownish how much this is backfired on McCrone [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3471.4599999999996s)]
*  He was so hell-bent on trying to frustrate Marine Le Pen that he threw the election to New Popular Front who has now announced [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3474.74s)]
*  That they will not work with him. Okay now Jake how you may want to say [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3482.22s)]
*  Well, this is the will of the majority [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3486.3799999999997s)]
*  But the majority of the country did not want to vote for chaos [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3487.7s)]
*  But chaos is what they've got because now there is no dominant faction in their parliament, right and a new popular [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3491.2999999999997s)]
*  India they just lost majority in India, right? [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3499.02s)]
*  Which is the first time in 12 years and the UK is also up in disarray [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3501.34s)]
*  No, there's a it's a majority but not a supermajority not a supermajority. Sorry [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3505.26s)]
*  Yeah [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3509.34s)]
*  Sorry [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3509.7000000000003s)]
*  Good news free bird is that Melochon will not have a majority in the assembly to push through those radical policies that he wants [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3510.1400000000003s)]
*  No faction will have a majority because they're not going to work with each other [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3516.5s)]
*  You've got three three big parties here or three big groups and you need two of them working together to get anything done [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3519.78s)]
*  So what's gonna happen is you're just gonna have basically a logjam [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3527.1000000000004s)]
*  and [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3530.7999999999997s)]
*  Like Marine Le Pen said reform in France is just gonna have to wait and we're gonna lose another year [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3531.7599999999998s)]
*  Do you think socialist ideologies are on the rise in the youth in the industrialized world? [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3537.3199999999997s)]
*  And is that showing up in elections around the world? I [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3541.6s)]
*  Think what's happening is that there is a pent-up demand for reform people are craving reform [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3544.68s)]
*  I understand that system does not work. It is great for everyone. It feels rigged. It feels corrupt and [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3550.96s)]
*  It's and it's resistant to reform and so they are basically clamoring for that and [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3557.44s)]
*  They will get it wherever they can take it in the past socialism has won when this has happened [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3563.44s)]
*  This has happened this happened after World War one [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3567.84s)]
*  It's happened multiple times in history where we've seen the socialists to rise in these moments [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3569.96s)]
*  Well, I don't think it's because socialism is that desirable? I actually think that the desire for reform [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3575.5600000000004s)]
*  I think it is first and foremost looking for what I would call a [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3581.92s)]
*  nationalist populist [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3585.9599999999996s)]
*  Solution right and you can see here that national rally did do better than you popular fronts considerably better [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3587.64s)]
*  But it was that the system's desire to hand a victory [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3593.8399999999997s)]
*  To new popular front that gave them the win and I think you see a similar thing in the United States [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3598.16s)]
*  Look if Joe Biden had just shut down the border for the last four years [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3603.2799999999997s)]
*  Huge way would be in a materially different position. Absolutely, but the radicals in his party didn't want to do that [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3608.56s)]
*  So in a way you could say that you have a similar type of [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3614.04s)]
*  Conspiracy taking place where the center-left would rather [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3617.92s)]
*  Enable and support the radical progressives as opposed to making sensible [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3621.92s)]
*  Moderations or sensible adjustments by that would actually make them much more popular [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3628.4s)]
*  It would and what has Trump done in Trump 2.0 that I think I don't know who could have possibly coached [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3631.64s)]
*  Or given any feedback Trump of how to win this election, but he seems much more presidential [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3638.32s)]
*  He seems normal. He basically went right to the middle on abortion [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3643.52s)]
*  He went right to the middle on immigration and he's not acting like a lunatic and name-calling and you know his debate performance [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3647.7599999999998s)]
*  Was fantastic. He just sat back the way look look who's been the most ardent supporter of Joe Biden [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3654.36s)]
*  It's been the progressive left [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3660.8s)]
*  Right. Those are the folks that have actually said hey [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3662.92s)]
*  and and I think probably it's because there's a [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3666.36s)]
*  Underlying quid pro quo I play AOC. Yes, Bernie Sanders all of these folks Elizabeth Warren [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3669.6s)]
*  If they support Biden and he wins a second term [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3676.32s)]
*  I suspect that there's going to be a lot of their legislative agenda that basically gets put up for vote 100% [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3679.84s)]
*  100% yes, I think there's a common denominator here that both McCrone and Biden [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3687.08s)]
*  would rather throw the the government of the country to [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3692.4s)]
*  Radicals and communists then [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3697.02s)]
*  Implement sensible restrictions on immigration [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3700.22s)]
*  It's mind-blowing to me that neither McCrone nor Biden can simply make a sensible adjustment on immigration [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3702.54s)]
*  People do not want open borders. They especially don't want them in Europe. They don't want them here either [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3709.54s)]
*  Reasonable borders reasonable immigration if I had to kind of give you my opinion on all of this [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3716.22s)]
*  I do think that when you look across all of these countries [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3720.58s)]
*  I do think Freeburg is touching on something but I think the explanation [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3723.52s)]
*  Doesn't have to be this idea that people are embracing socialism [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3728.6800000000003s)]
*  I think there's a much simpler explanation as well [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3733.28s)]
*  which is that we've gone through a very difficult period of joblessness of inflation of [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3735.36s)]
*  High costs and I think typically what happens is you have governmental turnover in these moments [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3740.76s)]
*  And so the incumbent gets tossed out and somebody else comes in and whatever they're saying [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3746.36s)]
*  Seems like the new thing. So for example in Canada right now the opposite is trending which is the liberal socialist [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3753.02s)]
*  Government just looks totally incompetent and it looks like the progressives when this election happens [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3760.3399999999997s)]
*  It's just gonna completely run over them. And so that's more of a swing to the right [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3765.8599999999997s)]
*  So I think it's less left or right. I think it's incumbent [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3769.54s)]
*  People who have not done necessarily a great job in these last four years getting tossed out for folks that are new [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3774.38s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that explains a lot of these elections more than socialism or anything else I really hope you're right [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3779.12s)]
*  I just worry about [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3783.96s)]
*  Like the trend of economic [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3785.52s)]
*  globalization [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3788.24s)]
*  Has kind of moved every because it used to be that every country kind of looked like its own country politically [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3789.36s)]
*  And there's just a lot of alignment happening where sacks is right. It's like look it's in every other country of the world [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3794.62s)]
*  other than the West you embrace the [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3801.8s)]
*  National traditions that make a culture its own [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3805.8599999999997s)]
*  But if you came to Sri Lanka, you'd see people in saris, you'd see people dressed in traditional garb [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3808.7799999999997s)]
*  You speak this one language that somewhat complicated not spoken anywhere else, although we teach English as well [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3815.58s)]
*  But the point is that there are these cultural traditions and that's just an example of a country that I know well [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3822.2999999999997s)]
*  But many countries if you look across Africa, it's the same if you look across Asia Central and South America in the West [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3826.8199999999997s)]
*  It's more of that, you know you come and there's this kind of like kind of like odd monoculture [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3833.3s)]
*  And I think at some point people are pushing back against that [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3838.82s)]
*  I do agree with David that there is that pushback and I and I think that that's well [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3842.1800000000003s)]
*  Mary's really in that we we had a concept called the melting pot [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3848.1400000000003s)]
*  Where you would culturally assimilate and if you say that today and you were to teach that in schools [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3851.1000000000004s)]
*  I think people would get very upset very thinking like you are giving up your culture [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3855.94s)]
*  No, you've chosen to leave your land and make a new world here in this new experiment called America [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3860.58s)]
*  And if you assimilate you're welcome here if you don't want to assimilate you're not welcome in America [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3867.46s)]
*  That's what they taught when we went to school as Gen Xers in the 70s and 80s [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3872.68s)]
*  No, no, so my only point sits and I agree with you Jake. Oh is you as a country? [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3877.74s)]
*  You're allowed to have those beliefs [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3883.2s)]
*  It's not that just because you're in the West you have to throw that out and all of a sudden you have to succumb to [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3884.94s)]
*  this belief that [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3889.9s)]
*  Everybody else's culture is better than the one that you've had for the last four or five hundred years [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3891.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't think that that's necessarily true and I think you miss out on a lot by saying that so it's your point [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3895.3s)]
*  I just I just think that when you look globally [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3900.7000000000003s)]
*  There's a really interesting quote from Peter Thiel that actually is he was he made this comment [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3903.5s)]
*  Which is if you look at the Ten Commandments [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3908.5s)]
*  He's like the first and the tenth are the most powerful because the first one is about [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3911.02s)]
*  Looking up and the second and the tenth is not about looking down everything else is about looking left and right of you [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3915.38s)]
*  And he brings it up in this context of all of these commandments the the middle eight are all about how you should not be [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3920.7s)]
*  Looking to the left and the right [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3927.9s)]
*  Figuring out and making yourself getting tilted about the fact that you have less than the other person no coveting and [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3930.02s)]
*  And I just think that there may be something interesting in that idea [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3936.38s)]
*  Which is that what we've really done is we've created tools [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3939.64s)]
*  That have allowed you to just obsess and fantasize about all these random people's lives who you think are perfect [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3943.18s)]
*  but they're just manufactured trying to get views anyways, and you just leave being angry and [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3950.18s)]
*  Thinking your life sucks and in fact your life is actually not that bad [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3956.02s)]
*  And I think if we had more truth and honesty and authenticity [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3959.2999999999997s)]
*  Maybe there would be less of this perception and you'd actually try to just enjoy what you have [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3963.18s)]
*  I don't think we figured that out. Let's wrap up here on the hot swap summer update and the speedrun primary [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3968.08s)]
*  Biden still insists he's still running for president and he will not stand down [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3976.48s)]
*  Since the last episode so much has happened [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=3981.68s)]

*  Clooney gave Obama the heads up before he published this [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4024.48s)]
*  NBC is reporting that Biden has lost his donor base anonymous quotes. The money has absolutely shut off [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4028.44s)]

*  prediction [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4084.6s)]
*  I've got it a [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4087.36s)]
*  whistleblower will emerge in the next 10 days if you are a doctor a nurse a [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4089.36s)]

*  We know there's a cover-up [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4111.24s)]

*  Did you see this report that a doctor a neurologist went to the White House visited? [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4127.679999999999s)]
*  what us visited and the New York Times is putting this out there and then watch this clip of [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4132.84s)]
*  Kjp [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4139.0s)]
*  Who is absolutely covering everything up? We all play poker. This person is bluffing. They're lying [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4141.0s)]
*  It's so obvious play the clip Nick [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4147.32s)]
*  Wait a second [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4155.0s)]
*  In regards I just wait [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4158.12s)]
*  Hold on a second [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4160.52s)]
*  Wait, no, no, no, no, no. No, wait a minute calm Ed, please [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4163.04s)]
*  A little respect here, please every year around the president's physical [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4168.280000000001s)]
*  Examination he sees a neurologist. That's three times, right? [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4174.360000000001s)]
*  So I am telling you that he has seen or neurologist three times while he has been in this presidency [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4177.88s)]
*  So that is answering that question. No, it is it is you're asking [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4183.88s)]
*  Just I also said to you and I also said to you for security reasons [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4190.56s)]
*  We cannot share names [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4195.9s)]
*  The point of a press conference is that you ask questions and you ask hard questions [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4206.0599999999995s)]
*  This person is covering it up. It is a huge cover-up. I haven't seen somebody lie this bold face since elizabeth [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4211.5s)]
*  Holmes if you had the machine that did the blood test you'd show the machine [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4218.139999999999s)]
*  If there's a cognitive test that shows he's not in decline [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4223.02s)]
*  They would show the test show the test if you're a whistleblower release the test [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4226.22s)]
*  Somebody out there has the results of these tests [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4231.42s)]
*  And if you're a doctor and you're covering this up if you work in that white house and you're covering this up [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4233.5s)]
*  Is the most unethical unamerican immoral thing you can do [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4238.14s)]
*  And this is the reason we have whistleblower protections [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4242.22s)]
*  There are 50 people who probably know what's going on here and I know there's at least five [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4244.7s)]
*  So somewhere in that number is somebody who has a profile in courage who will come out and tell the american people [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4249.0199999999995s)]
*  What the hell is going on here? [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4255.82s)]
*  Oh, I think we already know what's going on jake. L. I know but this not telling the truth in a press conference with the press [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4258.0599999999995s)]
*  And then admonishing the press [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4264.78s)]
*  Admonishing the press like this. It's complete utter bullsh**. So in that press conference, it's nice to see the press actually doing their job because their job is to [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4267.5599999999995s)]
*  Hold truth to account and to actually ask tough questions and they're finally doing it [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4276.3s)]
*  But I see in that press conference not just a liar at the podium [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4281.5s)]
*  I think the entire audience are a bunch of liars, too [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4285.18s)]
*  Because they knew they knew the truth about the situation and they refused to report it and they refused to investigate it until now [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4288.06s)]
*  now [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4295.34s)]
*  What you've heard in the past week or so is a bunch of of people who knew about the situation telling on themselves [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4296.06s)]
*  So first you had george cluney and that new york times op-ed he says that after the fundraiser we did yeah [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4302.86s)]
*  I knew and everyone there knew that was a month ago. What took you so long to come out? [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4308.62s)]
*  Olivia newsy had says she had the story for new york magazine six months ago [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4313.58s)]
*  Okay, she had anonymous sources [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4319.9s)]
*  But she said she was afraid to publish it because the white house would basically push back and she didn't think the press corps way back [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4321.5s)]
*  Her chuck todd just said it on a podcast that a cabinet official [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4327.5s)]
*  Okay in the biden white house told him two years ago that he could not get a meeting with the president [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4332.46s)]
*  Because the president was effectively incapacitated and his inner circle was keeping him shielded chuck todd knew [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4338.86s)]
*  Why didn't chuck todd report that why didn't chuck todd pass it on to an investigative reporter to mbc to investigate that? [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4345.0199999999995s)]
*  These dereliction of duty is the answer. It's a dereliction of duty. Of course, but let me tell you what they were trying to do. Okay [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4351.98s)]
*  They were trying to weaken the bernies this thing [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4360.06s)]
*  Absolutely, they thought they could get biden through the election and so they were on narrative [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4362.700000000001s)]
*  And they weren't going to report the truth about his condition hundred percent [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4368.9400000000005s)]
*  We're just going to try and get him across the finish line. They're all complicit in this cover-up [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4372.14s)]
*  and [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4377.02s)]
*  They don't deserve any credibility because now they're finally reporting it because the only reason they're reporting it [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4377.820000000001s)]
*  Is because of concerns about biden's electability. They're afraid that he's going to lose [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4384.22s)]
*  And the turning point was that debate because the whole country could see it [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4388.78s)]
*  So in the wake of that they're starting to panic and they're realizing. Oh wait, we need a new candidate [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4392.3s)]
*  So finally they're telling the truth about this situation, but they had absolutely no intention of telling the truth about it [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4397.02s)]
*  Because they could have done it a long time ago [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4402.54s)]
*  And here we're just going to try and they're just going to try and drag biden across the finish line [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4404.860000000001s)]
*  And we need to give one person his flat horse here [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4408.860000000001s)]
*  Dean phillips came on this program seven months ago [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4411.5s)]
*  And if you listen to all in the number one podcast in the world you're going to know [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4414.54s)]
*  What's going to happen in the future? [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4418.62s)]
*  It's not just no strickhannis here the guests come on and tell us the truth dean phillips told us I quote [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4420.38s)]
*  When I asked him, i'm not sure who asked him. Uh when we asked him [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4426.54s)]
*  He said people are saying that i'm causing his problems [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4430.38s)]
*  That I could risk his reelection [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4434.3s)]
*  I'm certainly not the guy that has shown his decline. That's on video. That's on audio. You see it [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4437.18s)]
*  He's a human being for goodness sake seven months ago. He said this he's a human being [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4443.42s)]
*  He's now in his 80s. He is clearly in decline [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4449.1s)]
*  But do I think he will be in a position to continue leading this company this country in the future? [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4451.74s)]
*  I do not I think i'm joined about 75 in the country in saying that [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4455.9800000000005s)]
*  He was clear on this podcast. He was clear on this podcast and kudos to dean phillips for having the courage to tell the truth [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4460.06s)]
*  He was one of the only people in the democratic party to tell the truth [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4465.66s)]
*  Remember he also said in our podcast that he called up jb pritzker [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4468.3s)]
*  He called up gretchen whitmer. He said where are you guys? You're the leaders of the democrat party [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4472.06s)]
*  Why aren't you challenging president biden? He obviously isn't fit to serve. They told him shut up. They wouldn't take his phone calls [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4476.22s)]
*  Okay, and look dean phillips knew the truth without having special access to the president quite frankly [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4482.9400000000005s)]
*  He's a backbencher, right? But it was obvious to him. They all knew the whole party knew [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4488.54s)]
*  But their strategy was to pretend and deny and to pretend anyone who told to excommunicate [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4494.38s)]
*  Anyone like dean phillips who told the truth and to try and discredit anyone who reported the truth as basically [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4500.879999999999s)]
*  A partisan or a liar who is trafficking in the two fakes remember that it's so all these people are complicit [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4507.04s)]
*  They're all complicit and the only reason they're telling the truth now is because they're afraid of losing an election [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4513.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, and the receipts are coming. Well, let's just play this out. So if there is a [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4518.719999999999s)]
*  Grant cover-up. I think jason you are right that there's too much time between now and the election [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4523.759999999999s)]
*  There will be a [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4529.12s)]
*  Deep throat watergate style leak here, you know [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4531.599999999999s)]
*  There will be a woodward and burn scene and gets to the bottom of this [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4534.32s)]
*  I just think the odds of that are 100% of it not happening are too low [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4537.04s)]
*  So I guess then the real question is is it that the only way to keep the charade going is [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4541.839999999999s)]
*  The quote-unquote threat of the donald trump boogie man. Is that what they use basically to hang over these people to [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4549.839999999999s)]
*  Of course, yes, I mean that listen that worked last time [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4556.64s)]
*  trump in the [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4560.8s)]
*  The overwhelming majority of americans felt trump's first presidency was too divisive and it was too chaotic. They use that [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4562.88s)]
*  To win. Okay, fair enough now. They're trying to use that again. It's not working [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4570.64s)]
*  Why trump 2.0? He's coming across as reasonable a lot of the things he got right when you [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4575.360000000001s)]
*  Re-under-rided him about the border. He got that right. The economy was pretty good under him. He did some things, correct [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4580.54s)]
*  He's not like all demagogue and all evil. I have my problems with his behavior. I've made it documented here [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4585.44s)]
*  But you cannot use that excuse [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4591.2s)]
*  Anymore because americans are going to say cognitive decline somebody with alzheimer's like my aunt my uncle my parent whatever they've experienced at first hand [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4593.36s)]
*  Or trump it's an easy choice for most americans and that's why trump will beat biden [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4601.44s)]
*  And that's why they're going to do the speed run and that's catching steam next and then let's just we can wrap on that [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4606.32s)]
*  I think [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4612.639999999999s)]
*  I mentioned here [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4613.6s)]
*  The speed run primary a couple of weeks ago nick roll the clip [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4615.200000000001s)]
*  Must credit no stracanis. They're going to do democratic primary speed [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4619.92s)]
*  Here's what's going to happen. They're going to do five debates in 10 weeks [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4624.96s)]
*  And then whoever wins wins kamala. He's going to resign kamala becomes president [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4628.8s)]
*  kamala gets to um [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4633.84s)]
*  Run in the speed run [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4636.08s)]
*  She gets to speed run like everybody else deid phillips gets to come in everybody speed runs it [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4637.360000000001s)]
*  The they take over the media [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4641.92s)]
*  The media will go crazy over the summer massive ratings boom pull up the semaphore article [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4644.8s)]
*  After I made my prediction two democratic party insiders have floated this very unique idea in semaphore [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4651.04s)]
*  It's a pretty obvious idea. I guess biden steps down as the number one. Where did you get it from jaykel? It was my idea [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4657.12s)]
*  Because I did not hear it anywhere. Okay. I I personally don't think it's gonna happen [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4663.360000000001s)]
*  But I still think you deserve credit for being the first agree [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4666.8s)]
*  So you came up with this and now it's a spread or what? [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4669.36s)]
*  Well, here we go. This is amazing. I mean you're name-checking yourself here [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4672.799999999999s)]
*  So this is pretty I don't know what's happening in this bizarro universe [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4676.639999999999s)]
*  I put on a red tie and all of a sudden i'm getting everything right. Okay, I who knows biden steps down [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4680.24s)]
*  I mean you're you're listen so many times in the past your head has been so far up your ass [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4685.5199999999995s)]
*  But this time it's really real you open it and you see your face, but it's you just name-checking yourself [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4689.2s)]
*  I guess I gotta name-check me [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4694.0s)]
*  But here's what semaphore says this is their version biden steps down as the nominee mid-july [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4696.08s)]
*  Okay, that's now biden announces the new system with support from kamala harris candidates would have a few days to throw their hats [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4700.96s)]
*  In the ring democrats would start a primary sprint. Oh not a speedrun a primary sprint where six candidates not 10 [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4707.12s)]
*  Who received the most votes from delegates pledged to run? [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4714.4s)]
*  Positive only campaigns in the month leading up to the dnc weekly forums for each candidate would be moderated by cultural icons [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4717.28s)]
*  Oh interesting punch-up michelle obama oprah taylor swift in order to engage voters as I talked about taking over the media [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4723.68s)]
*  Nominee will be chosen by delegates using rang choice voting your favorite sax [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4729.84s)]
*  Before the start of the dnc [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4734.240000000001s)]
*  On august 9th. So anyway, there you have it folks speedrun coming whistleblower august 19 speedrun [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4736.400000000001s)]
*  And the whistleblower look for it this month [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4743.360000000001s)]
*  Okay, look [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4745.52s)]
*  I I think you deserve credit for being the first to talk about this and that idea is clearly gaining some currency on the left [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4746.0s)]
*  However at the end of the day [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4752.16s)]
*  I don't think the democrats can afford to do that because they're already in the state of chaos right now [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4753.44s)]
*  And if they finally succeed in pushing biden overboard the last thing they're going to want to do is have the chaos of an open [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4757.92s)]
*  Open primary even if it is a speedrun primary. I think they're just going to have to go to kamala harris [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4763.12s)]
*  I think that's what they've decided. I think that if they succeed in pushing biden out [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4768.64s)]
*  Which does seem probably more likely than not at this point. I think it's got to be harris [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4773.04s)]
*  And I think she's going to be the the nominee so I think harris can beat trump [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4777.76s)]
*  You worried about him? [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4782.56s)]
*  Well, no, look, I think that trump should win regardless, but it's an opportunity for them to reset the race and [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4784.08s)]
*  That's what's driving all of this is that they're concerned about losing but look, let me say this that everything that's happened here [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4791.28s)]
*  with biden's [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4797.84s)]
*  cognitive state [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4799.6s)]
*  It's just one in a series of hoaxes and cover-ups that the democrat party has [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4801.2s)]
*  Transpired over the last several years it's gotten to the point where you have to wonder can these guys even run a presidential campaign? [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4807.599999999999s)]
*  Without hoaxes you had the steel dossier. Okay, you have the whole suckers and losers hoax [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4814.5599999999995s)]
*  You have the very fine people hoax you have that. This is the best version of biden hoax [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4819.12s)]
*  You had the whole cheap fake hoax [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4824.08s)]
*  and [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4826.32s)]
*  You've just got to wonder [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4827.28s)]
*  Is this a party who deserves the trust of the american people? [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4829.36s)]
*  I think that trump deserves another term just as a rebuke to all the misinformation and lies that the democratic party has told about him [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4832.799999999999s)]
*  And I think that he should win shout out to scott adams and his hoax list. Here we go. The scott adams [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4840.96s)]
*  Scott adams is obsessed with sex 20 of the hoax list. There's like 10 more. Okay. No, he's he's been keeping a list [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4846.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, trump deserves to win just based on all the hoaxes that have been thrown at him [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4853.839999999999s)]
*  all right, and you know what you got to give him credit because [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4857.92s)]
*  It was his decision to go on cnn in that debate that really called their birth on this whole thing [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4860.8s)]
*  God when they started this is when you knew something was in the air when he got like [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4866.88s)]
*  Started getting ovations and clapping from the rigged [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4871.68s)]
*  CNN audience for the town hall. I mean or maybe cnn did that and set up themselves and set up the the democrats [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4876.32s)]
*  I don't know. I don't think it's a setup. I don't think it's a setup [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4883.28s)]
*  No, I think look there are a lot of people who do think that it was a controlled demolition they want biden out [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4886.24s)]
*  I don't think so. I think this situation is so conspiracy theory [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4891.44s)]
*  It is a conspiracy theory and I understand why people might think that because so many conspiracy theories have turned out to be true [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4894.32s)]
*  However, I don't believe that's what happened. I believe fascinating that biden staff [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4900.24s)]
*  Created conditions for the debate that they thought would be untenable to trump, right? [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4905.04s)]
*  They said that we're going to choose the host. They're going to be hosts who've basically already called trump hitler, right? [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4909.5199999999995s)]
*  So it's like the most favorable setting [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4914.959999999999s)]
*  They said there's not going to be an audience [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4916.959999999999s)]
*  We're going to turn off your microphone and they thought that trump would just say no to all of this [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4918.32s)]
*  And they'd be able to get biden through without debate, but trump called their bluff. He said, okay, i'll do it [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4922.639999999999s)]
*  Sure, and he walked into the lion's den just like remember a year ago. He walked into the lion's den at cnn [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4927.36s)]
*  Yeah, to do that town hall remember anybody in [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4933.5199999999995s)]
*  Comedically, you gotta admit that trump has the way anybody in mainstream [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4937.179999999999s)]
*  You gotta admit that trump has the way votes like tony montana said the only thing in this world that gives orders is balls [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4942.96s)]
*  Absolutely, you gotta admit to a [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4950.400000000001s)]
*  You get that [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w30WLkNU47g&t=4952.8s)]
