*  Well, we obviously have talked to Shane at poly market for some time and we set up a deal with them where we could put our [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=165.45999999999998s)]
*  Own markets up on the on the site [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=172.07999999999998s)]

*  From the bestie skiing. Is that true? Oh [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=206.94s)]

*  I come looking great [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=215.7s)]
*  There comes looking good and then here comes somebody I [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=217.62s)]
*  Think the technical term Joe Lonsdale does for that third person is a beep beep [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=222.66s)]
*  Okay, here we go. Look at this technique coming down. Look at your mom [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=228.22s)]
*  Chum up you really advances last season. Look at him cutting those s turns Gavin. What do you think? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=233.1s)]
*  listen to me I I [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=238.62s)]
*  Made a very strategic decision to stop snowboarding so I could learn to ski with my kids [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=241.9s)]
*  It is so hard to learn how to do something in your 40s [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=246.44000000000003s)]
*  No, I mean if you've never done it, but I do appreciate what you and your brother did for me last season [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=249.56s)]
*  I learned a couple things. So it's been yeah, my birthday with the black bomber my third season was great [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=253.70000000000002s)]
*  I am absolutely amazed at the progress you're making free birth. I'm amazed you made it onto the mountain [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=258.52000000000004s)]
*  You you were out there a number of days. You're getting it done. I [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=264.72s)]
*  Needed new boots and I tore my MCL last season [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=268.64s)]
*  So I'm in it got really tweaked when I went out there, but I'm good. It was great. I had a lot of fun [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=271.24s)]
*  I mean, I think I need four days. Yeah, you're great four days. Okay, I finished my 16th day yesterday [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=275.52000000000004s)]
*  But I took today off just to get prepared here. Yeah, I got 16 day [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=280.72s)]
*  I do the executive program Gavin I go out for an hour and a half to three hours sip sip sip ten runs and I'm done [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=283.36s)]
*  I only ski in the morning [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's the way to do you say me same and and at 12 15 have lunch relax [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=290.32s)]
*  Get a little work done need a healthy healthy mix of apres ski and ski [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=295.6s)]
*  Gavin how would you compare yourself to what you just witnessed in that video your skiing ability? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=300.52s)]
*  Where would you rank yourself? Clearly? It's me Chamath freeberg in that ranking. Where would you live in the ranking? I [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=305.84s)]
*  Would say I make two observations first like I'm in the bottom percentile in terms of natural athleticism [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=312.2s)]
*  Okay, you have many many thousands of hours skiing [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=318.32s)]
*  great [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=321.79999999999995s)]
*  Okay, and I would just leave I would just [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=323.0s)]
*  Yes, well then we'll be going out with you next year new bestie [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=326.0s)]
*  All right [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=330.64s)]
*  We got to get to it. We're to start off with politics gentlemen [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=331.92s)]
*  We got to keep this moving because there's so many predictions [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=335.52s)]
*  We're gonna do our 2025 prediction for biggest political winner now last year [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=337.8s)]
*  Well, yeah, I think we got it kind of wrong freeberg you said independent third party in the US [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=343.12s)]
*  And we did see some of that with you know, the breakout of Robert Kennedy maybe [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=348.64s)]
*  Chamath you said independent centrist. We didn't get there with that one and I said dark horse presidential candidates [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=355.0s)]
*  Maybe I get a quarter point right there with wait. Hold on. What do you mean? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=360.24s)]
*  We didn't get their independent centrist won the election for Megan [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=363.32s)]
*  Independent centrist won the election really? That's what you believe. Yeah, okay. I [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=367.44s)]
*  Didn't think that it was the independence, but okay. I think independent centrist swung the election for Biden in 2020 [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=371.8s)]
*  And then I think they swung the election for Trump in 2024 [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=377.88s)]
*  Huh is that statistically correct you think freeberg? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=382.28s)]
*  You about that independent centrist did the election or Gavin? What do you think? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=385.16s)]
*  I think it's right like I think a lot of there are a lot of people not just interest but a lot of people who had [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=389.16s)]
*  been [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=394.98s)]
*  Lifelong Democratic voters who voted for Trump? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=396.04s)]
*  So I do think Trump won the centrist we trump trump won everything [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=400.16s)]
*  Essentially, yeah, okay. So Bob who's your prediction for the biggest political winner of 2025? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=406.16s)]
*  My biggest political winner for 2025 are fiscal [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=410.52s)]
*  conservatives [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=414.26000000000005s)]
*  I think that we are going to test a very important concept in 2025 [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=416.42s)]
*  and I hope it works which is that of austerity and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=423.46000000000004s)]
*  the reason why austerity has to work is that the only thing left after austerity is to cut entitlements and [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=428.1s)]
*  I think that in doing this we are going to figure out how much waste fraud and abuse [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=434.90000000000003s)]
*  Exists in the United States federal government. I think that that's going to spill over to a lot of state elections [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=441.78s)]
*  and I think that the fiscal conservatives that have been clamoring for a more restrained approach to spending [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=449.82s)]
*  Will have their day in 2025. Okay fiscal conservatives from Schmoth freeberg [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=458.46s)]
*  Sure prediction for the biggest political winner 2025. I also took a [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=463.38s)]
*  Class-based approach I chose young candidates [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=468.5s)]
*  So Trump's cabinet picks have an average age of 40 to 45 years old [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=471.62s)]
*  Compared to the Biden cabinet where the average age is a little over 59 almost 60 years old [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=477.98s)]
*  And I do think that this marks the beginning of a new trend in [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=482.82s)]
*  The kind of age range of political candidates shifting younger [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=487.22s)]
*  So I think that this is something we should expect as candidates start to emerge for the midterms by the end of 2025 [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=491.74s)]
*  We'll start to see younger new names start to pop up that deliver [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=497.98s)]
*  Resident messages and aren't part of kind of the old guard of you know, the aging political class [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=502.5s)]
*  So I think that's a trend that's kind of underway now [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=507.9s)]
*  Excellent young candidates. We've got fiscal conservatives young candidates Gavin. What do you got for the 2025 prediction for biggest political winner? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=510.94s)]
*  I would say Trump and centrist or my choice for 2025 biggest political winner [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=516.98s)]
*  I went with something similar to you freeberg [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=522.3s)]
*  I said gen X and the elder [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=525.02s)]
*  Millennials if you look at the notable gen X appointments, you got Elon with Doge you got Sax obviously Marco Rubio [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=528.22s)]
*  My god, it just goes that and then if you look at the elder Millennials JD Vance Vivek [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=535.66s)]
*  Tulsi just a lot of young people and this is going to be absolutely fantastic [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=540.26s)]
*  I think because they're gonna start thinking not just about themselves [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=544.86s)]
*  As the bloomers are doing with Social Security taxes real estate only different issues that they tend to pick for themselves [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=549.02s)]
*  They're gonna start thinking about maybe their own kids and themselves [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=555.62s)]
*  So yeah, it's obviously a sea change is underway. So they have the folks for our predictions for political winner [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=559.38s)]
*  Let's go with political loser here prediction for political loser. We'll start off with you Gavin [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=565.86s)]
*  Well, we'll do this a little round robin here. We'll snake it around Gavin [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=570.42s)]
*  What do you think who'll be the biggest political loser of? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=573.46s)]
*  2025 I think Putin I think Putin is going to lose bigly [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=576.3s)]
*  So if you are Xi Jinping, you know Xi Jinping [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=583.42s)]
*  Russia is a client state of China at this point. And if you're Xi Jinping [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=586.86s)]
*  What is happening is now a disaster for you because Europe is starting to rear and which is which will only accelerate this year [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=592.4599999999999s)]
*  That will allow America to take resources out of Europe and put them in Japan and South Korea [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=600.46s)]
*  and all over the Pacific and that makes it a lot harder for you to do what you most want to do, which is [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=607.86s)]
*  Reunify China and Taiwan or invade Taiwan. Let's call it what it is [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=615.62s)]
*  And I just think Xi is going to begin decoupling from Putin if you're Trump you want to show that [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=620.22s)]
*  You're independent that you're not [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=628.86s)]
*  enthralled to Putin in any way, so I think Trump is gonna be a lot tougher on Putin than people think and [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=631.98s)]
*  I [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=638.4599999999999s)]
*  Think he's gonna get a very very a deal. That's very very bad [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=640.38s)]
*  For Russia and Ukraine and you know, you've lost half a million people and for what? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=645.54s)]
*  For what exactly? Yeah, and it's a thousand over a thousand days into this [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=651.3s)]
*  Nobody from the West has you know in the NATO or America no, no soldiers have lost their lives from our side [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=656.14s)]
*  We've just given them weapons and so it's a humiliating defeat so far for Putin [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=662.78s)]
*  I agree with you free Berg your prediction for the biggest political loser of [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=666.4200000000001s)]
*  2025 free Berg's prediction. I'm gonna predict the pro-war [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=670.82s)]
*  Neocons who are gonna go [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=675.0600000000001s)]
*  Head to head with the JD Vance and Elan's and others of the world [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=677.46s)]
*  And I think that they're gonna lose and I think that there's gonna be this kind of big crack in the establishment of this this [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=682.38s)]
*  Neocon [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=688.82s)]
*  Movement that's been very pro conflict around the world and we've heard it in the speeches and in the commentary from JD and others [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=690.1s)]
*  And I think this is gonna be the year that it's all gonna kind of come to a head [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=697.22s)]
*  I think they're gonna be on the losing side [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=700.22s)]
*  Can I have a can't take the other side just just a little bit? So that's why they're here [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=702.58s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's right in reality [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=707.76s)]
*  But I think you know Trump said something very interesting about John Bolton [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=710.4s)]
*  He said the guy was absolutely crazy [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=714.0s)]
*  But it was awesome having him in the room when you were negotiating deals [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=716.72s)]
*  Right as people looked at this guy looking angry red in the face [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=719.8s)]
*  So excited to hit the nuclear button so excited to go to war and you ended up with much better deals [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=723.52s)]
*  Right. So I think you're gonna see probably a lot more [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=728.72s)]
*  Bellicosity from the Trump administration than anyone expects and that's just to get a good deal [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=732.2s)]
*  For you know between Russia and Ukraine and then it's to get China to kind of decouple from Russia [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=737.88s)]
*  So I think the in reality, I think you're right David [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=743.52s)]
*  But I think there will be a lot of rhetoric that is at odds with what you're saying before you end up being wrecked [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=746.76s)]
*  We already see it with Canada with NATO with Taiwan. There's a lot, you know, we're gonna [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=752.96s)]
*  Do this or this the tariffs? Obviously, there's just a lot of very aggressive posturing leading up to the negotiations that are hopefully gonna get the US [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=758.84s)]
*  Good deals. We'll see Shamath. You have a prediction for your [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=767.16s)]
*  2025 biggest political loser prediction. It's hard to do the biggest political loser of 2025 is going to be [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=770.96s)]
*  progressivism so [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=779.24s)]
*  November of last year right after the election [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=781.08s)]
*  I flew to London and went up to Oxford and I spoke at the Oxford Union and [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=783.48s)]
*  My speech was a full-throated [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=789.04s)]
*  defense of MAGA [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=791.8s)]
*  But it was mostly an explanation of MAGA [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=794.04s)]
*  and [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=797.04s)]
*  it was sort of the [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=798.2s)]
*  Antidote to [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=802.28s)]
*  Progressive instincts that had been riddling the Western G8 countries and was starting to basically come on gun [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=804.72s)]
*  And when you look at what's about to happen in 2025 in Canada, Justin Trudeau is going to lose massively to peer poly of [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=811.3s)]
*  in [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=820.68s)]
*  Germany AFD looks like they will win in France if there's a deadlock and it goes into an election [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=821.92s)]
*  More than likely Marine Le Pen is going to win and then in the UK where you see this unfolding [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=828.3199999999999s)]
*  child rape scandal where [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=833.92s)]
*  allegedly upwards of hundreds of thousands of young girls over the course of 20 plus years were being raped by [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=836.4s)]
*  Organizations of Pakistani Muslim men who were then not prosecuted [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=844.28s)]
*  For fears of stoking islamophobia as it turns out by the current Prime Minister Keir Starmer and [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=849.6s)]
*  If all of that comes to pass in the UK [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=857.72s)]
*  I think you're gonna see the Labour government fall and I think you're gonna see Nigel Farage win [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=860.1600000000001s)]
*  So what do all of these countries? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=865.4s)]
*  Look like by the end of 25 [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=868.4s)]
*  It's very much a repudiation of this class-based identity politics [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=871.84s)]
*  and I think that has enormous ripple effects all throughout the world and [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=876.32s)]
*  So I think the biggest political loser for 2025 I think stands to be progressivism quote-unquote [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=880.84s)]
*  But they will be labeled progressivism. I took something very similar. I said the racist vocal minority of [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=885.9200000000001s)]
*  Each one of these parties and there's a little bit of this on either side [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=893.76s)]
*  You have DEI on one side and then you just have outright racism on the other side and it's probably five percent of MAGA and [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=898.64s)]
*  Five percent of the left and just to recap last year's political predictions for 2024 our predictions for political loser was I said Netanyahu [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=904.9200000000001s)]
*  Freeberg you said Ukraine and Sharmoth you said the Koch family the GOP nailed that one. I nailed that one [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=912.8000000000001s)]
*  Freeberg any thoughts on last year's? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=919.64s)]
*  We're in the Republican side more than the Koch family. Do you think I? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=922.0400000000001s)]
*  Mean explain for the audience who maybe aren't as deep into it. Well, I think [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=926.36s)]
*  essentially 2024 was the end of the Republican Party as we knew it and [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=931.48s)]
*  I think what stands in its place is what I would call the MAGA [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=936.9200000000001s)]
*  reflection of a coalition of people that will be [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=941.12s)]
*  housed under [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=944.6800000000001s)]
*  The label of republicanism, which is to say that these folks aren't necessarily Republicans. These folks are [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=946.52s)]
*  Believers of the MAGA philosophy [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=953.6800000000001s)]
*  they're just using the Republican vessel in order to run their candidates and get elected and in that [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=955.64s)]
*  overturning of the status quo [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=962.6s)]
*  What you had was this one family who was at the center for the last few decades of political machinery [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=964.4s)]
*  That essentially decided candidates that it decided agenda that it decided policy and that was the Koch family and they spent an enormous amount of money [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=973.36s)]
*  To get that [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=981.52s)]
*  Which they stood up frankly that literally the day after Citizens United happened in the Supreme Court and I think that in that lens [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=983.6s)]
*  Those billions of dollars of investment have essentially gone to zero because I don't think it means much of anything anymore [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=992.2s)]
*  and if you look at the new class of [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=997.96s)]
*  donors who will decide [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1001.44s)]
*  what unquote Republican policy it's going to be the the Muriel Maddison's of the world the Elon Musk's of the world and [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1003.76s)]
*  That's very different than how I think the Kochs used to decide things. Do you think there's too much money in politics now Gavin? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1010.56s)]
*  I think there's too much money in politics now [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1016.76s)]
*  It's it's a good question [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1025.12s)]
*  You know, I might feel very very differently if I didn't agree so profoundly with with the largest donor in this political cycle [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1029.48s)]
*  Yeah, I [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1036.8799999999999s)]
*  Would say the reality is it's like the the the money as long as the money raised on each side is [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1038.92s)]
*  Roughly equivalent. I don't think it really matters that would that would be my take you just want some equivalents [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1046.64s)]
*  That's all. All right. Let's do our [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1054.0800000000002s)]
*  2025 predictions for biggest business winner freeberg. Why don't you start us off biggest business winner for 2025? What's your prediction? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1056.4s)]
*  So I feel like we're at a really interesting inflection point [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1063.5600000000002s)]
*  That is gonna make 2025 the year of autonomous hardware or robotics [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1069.2s)]
*  If 2024 was the year of kind of compute build out and the rollout of AI systems in software [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1075.24s)]
*  I think 2025 will be the year of the robot [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1082.18s)]
*  You know, there's a company. We just placed an order today actually [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1086.16s)]
*  Out of China called unitree [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1090.0800000000002s)]
*  Gavin have you looked at this company? Yeah, it's pretty wild actually [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1093.2s)]
*  It's an incredible business [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1097.56s)]
*  Incredible product. So their geo to robot is $1,600 has an API here it is you can run a payload on it [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1099.7199999999998s)]
*  It's got lidar on it. It's got kind of intelligence guidance systems on it [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1106.3999999999999s)]
*  This is the robot system that was used on some of those videos [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1110.6799999999998s)]
*  We looked at earlier this year where there were machine guns mounted to the back and it was basically a new kind of [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1114.3s)]
*  Field soldier. It's an autonomous field soldier, but really you can use it in scientific applications [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1119.1599999999999s)]
*  We're looking at using them in our on our on our test farms where it can wander the farm and take images and report data [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1124.12s)]
*  Back to us and it's such a low cost at like less than three thousand dollars. You can do some incredible things with it [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1129.68s)]
*  So this business just raised a couple hundred million dollars last month from mostly Chinese investors to Chinese company [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1135.44s)]
*  And I think that there's gonna be you know, other similar type [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1141.92s)]
*  Businesses, you know kind of takes a long time for things to work and then all of a sudden they happen faster than you could have ever [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1146.36s)]
*  Imagined I think this is gonna be the year where we're all gonna look at [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1151.6s)]
*  Humanoid robots and autonomous systems and be like, oh my god, I can't believe this is here [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1154.28s)]
*  So this could be the year what a good choice [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1159.36s)]
*  It's such a great strong choice for the biggest winner and I think the quote you're looking for is how did you go bankrupt? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1161.52s)]
*  Slowly and then all at once that's how these technology changes [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1167.32s)]
*  I'd man I would love to have one of these for the ranch to just run around and do the perimeter security [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1170.32s)]
*  Sorry, Nick pull up the you guys got to watch this if you haven't seen it Nick find the video of the geo 2 with [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1174.8s)]
*  The wheels on it managing terrain and everyone thought this was a BS video that it was like CGI wasn't real [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1179.0400000000002s)]
*  It was AI generated but like this thing is just [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1185.44s)]
*  Incredible. Here it is. This is a real video of this thing. Yeah [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1189.1200000000001s)]
*  And it can learn from an LLM too, right? Like a large language model could teach it how to do something [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1193.68s)]
*  Yeah, Gavin is this real? Like what's your real? Yeah. Yeah, I want to get the G1 which is their humanoid robot [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1199.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so pull up the humanoid. It's really cool [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1206.24s)]
*  And it's a little more expensive. Yeah, but yeah, I mean $16,000 was the cost of a used Prius [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1209.16s)]
*  Let's be honest that's in spitting distance of being affordable [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1215.0800000000002s)]
*  Here's the G1 look at this thing 16 grand and this thing you can you know, you can basically command it to do things for you [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1218.3600000000001s)]
*  in your house [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1225.16s)]
*  Hey or in your factory or can you get your workplace? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1226.24s)]
*  I was gonna say maybe we could get a poker dealer maybe bow, you know [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1232.72s)]
*  I wonder if this thing could deal cards. Remember why do you guys remember that robot that was on stage? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1236.4799999999998s)]
*  For our all-in holiday. Yeah [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1241.7199999999998s)]
*  One X so my my brother made an observation. He said as soon as that robot came out [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1244.28s)]
*  It's like everyone just wanted to abuse it [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1249.3799999999999s)]
*  He's like humans have this very interesting nature where like the robot emerges and all the humans want to do is like hurt the robot [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1251.4799999999998s)]
*  It's like a very strange revelation of human behavior. Yeah, like it just it's like oh, here's something I could dominate [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1258.36s)]
*  Here's something I can tell it because we're still threatened by it [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1264.8s)]
*  We want to make sure that we're the top of the species here and it doesn't feel like it's gonna be for much longer [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1267.68s)]
*  I mean these things will kick our ass pretty soon [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1272.6399999999999s)]
*  Anyway, these things are amazing. I think this is gonna be the year of the robots. That's my prediction [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1275.56s)]
*  Year of the robots is your prediction. I love it Gavin. What do you got? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1279.0s)]
*  Profoundly agree. I think you're the robots inclusive of FSD [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1282.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, I think FSD works today and it's gonna [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1288.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's gonna cross into mainstream adoption where I [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1291.88s)]
*  Already notice [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1296.52s)]
*  Particularly if I'm taking an uber late at night, I really really prefer to have a Tesla [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1298.3600000000001s)]
*  Just sometimes you get an uber driver who's who's tired [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1303.16s)]
*  And I just feel a lot safer if they have the FSD running and then obviously using it for yourself is amazing [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1307.72s)]
*  But I think it's gonna continue compounding at an accelerating rate. I [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1315.0s)]
*  Think the in a lot of ways [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1319.6000000000001s)]
*  What I'd say broadly is I think for a while it's going to be big businesses are winners big businesses that use AI [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1321.8000000000002s)]
*  thoughtfully and the reason is is that with what is happening what what oh three showed us open eyes you bottle a [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1330.3200000000002s)]
*  combination of reasoning and test time compute [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1339.8400000000001s)]
*  Like I think you're if you're a big business and you can pay a million dollars [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1343.3600000000001s)]
*  To let an AI think for six weeks about the most important question for your business [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1348.04s)]
*  That's going to be a profound advantage [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1354.4s)]
*  relative to small businesses [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1357.1200000000001s)]
*  That can't afford that and by the way, we are the other like inference compute [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1359.0s)]
*  It's going to be the the kind of derivative winner of that. We're gonna run out of GPUs accelerators compute [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1363.98s)]
*  In [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1371.2800000000002s)]
*  2025 the same way we did in 23 [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1372.44s)]
*  Okay, so you're also long Nvidia and chip makers [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1375.72s)]
*  Grok, etc because we're finding new uses for all that compute [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1379.3200000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. Okay, very good. Chamath. Do you have a prediction for your biggest business winner of 2025 sir? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1384.88s)]
*  I think the biggest business winner of 2025 are going to be [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1391.92s)]
*  dollar denominated stable coins [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1397.2s)]
*  Whoo, I'll make two points in [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1399.92s)]
*  2024 two critical things happened [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1403.2s)]
*  the first is that [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1406.3200000000002s)]
*  stable coins [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1409.3600000000001s)]
*  Essentially [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1411.96s)]
*  became uncoupled from crypto volatility and [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1413.96s)]
*  It started to be used for [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1418.4s)]
*  wholesale useful functions in running businesses and [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1421.3600000000001s)]
*  There's an image here that starts to show that so independent of crypto volatility what you saw were [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1425.68s)]
*  Stable coin usage just rising up and to the right [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1431.48s)]
*  That's an incredibly important decoupling that happened in 2024 [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1435.2800000000002s)]
*  The second and this data is still just trickling in but it's an incredible stat [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1439.48s)]
*  Stable coin usage at the end of the second quarter of 2024 was about 1.1 billion [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1446.64s)]
*  Transactions that summed to eight point five [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1454.68s)]
*  trillion dollars of transaction volume if you compare that to Visa [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1459.72s)]
*  Over the same period it was more than double visas [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1466.0800000000002s)]
*  transaction volume [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1471.24s)]
*  So I think what we have now is something that has fundamentally crossed a point of no return [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1472.92s)]
*  Similar to how last year I thought that the big trend was going to be [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1481.7s)]
*  Bitcoin in 2024. I would say that the big trend in 25 is stable coin usage. I think we're going to [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1485.5s)]
*  finally attack the duopoly of Visa and MasterCard, I think you're going to see an [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1491.78s)]
*  Enumerable number of use cases [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1498.98s)]
*  That sit and use [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1502.18s)]
*  Stable coin rails. I think when Donald Trump becomes president [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1504.82s)]
*  I think you're going to see him go after incredibly high credit card transactions and costs [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1508.46s)]
*  You're already seeing tracks in [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1514.9s)]
*  Consumer credit anyways because of these high APRs all of this stuff is going to come to a head in 2025 [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1518.54s)]
*  I think and I think stable coins could [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1525.16s)]
*  Quadruple or quintuple by the end of 25. I think it's just gonna be an enormous market great choice [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1528.42s)]
*  Should they be regulated Chamath we saw at some of these congressional hearings tether was kind of dragged for being the primary [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1533.8200000000002s)]
*  Transfer and monetary tool for terrorism for getting around sanctions and for human trafficking [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1543.1000000000001s)]
*  Should it be regulated and how I don't think I'm qualified to say how it should [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1549.66s)]
*  But I think the point is that there are these immutable logs that sit [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1555.8600000000001s)]
*  In between and on either side of all of these transactions and so I think the knowledge is there and [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1560.38s)]
*  There are a whole bunch of third-party services that add that intelligence layer. I [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1566.8200000000002s)]
*  Think the the thing to really question is if you just took 300 basis points of drag [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1571.7800000000002s)]
*  Yes out of the global economy [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1579.5s)]
*  Massive how valuable would that be and I think it would be valuable just in the United States alone [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1582.5800000000002s)]
*  To the tune of a trillion dollars. So the idea that you wouldn't do it at this point is [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1588.3999999999999s)]
*  Somewhat [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1595.32s)]
*  Quizical to me. So I just think that the economic justification for this now is just so profound Gavin [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1596.36s)]
*  Let me ask you a hard question there as well. Should the United States government give up the [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1602.26s)]
*  Let's face it, you know, they have a bit of a stranglehold [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1608.32s)]
*  They've got a bit of a monopoly on US dollars [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1611.04s)]
*  These things are a [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1613.72s)]
*  Competitor and we were sitting here on this program for the last couple years talking about the bricks and them starting their own [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1616.1200000000001s)]
*  Currency aren't these in some ways similar to that and they would take people off the USD standard [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1622.08s)]
*  How do you look at that because that is the criticism that some people in power have put forward? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1627.3600000000001s)]
*  I do I do think that they might be very good for the world [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1632.74s)]
*  but I do think they would be very bad for America if they replaced if [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1637.4s)]
*  Some constellation of stable coins became the new reserve currency. It is such a [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1642.88s)]
*  advantage to be able to [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1649.44s)]
*  borrow in your own currency [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1651.48s)]
*  And to give that up lightly that just that means you control [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1653.92s)]
*  You if you control the real size of your debt at all times. Oh [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1658.28s)]
*  Wow, we have a big big debt. I mean, this is a little bit like what we just did [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1664.32s)]
*  Let's just have let's just let inflation run hot and oh wow that that's a lot smaller than it was [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1668.1599999999999s)]
*  Effectively, so I think it would be a big mistake [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1675.12s)]
*  Freeberg you have any thoughts on it? We've been talking about currency here a whole bunch of last couple years any thoughts on [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1677.6399999999999s)]
*  stable coins and [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1684.1999999999998s)]
*  Just the monopoly we have on it. I don't know enough about how cable coins [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1686.04s)]
*  Well, that'll be one of our big topics for the year and we should definitely invite Jeremy Allaire from USD on [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1690.9599999999998s)]
*  Or USD see USD see Jeremy Allaire. I [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1696.04s)]
*  Mentioned by the way that I had this small little product that I [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1701.0s)]
*  Exposed to the world which is just our research and we sit it on top of sub stack again [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1708.6799999999998s)]
*  the tools aren't very good and we use stripe and [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1713.08s)]
*  Jeremy reached out to me and he's like I'll just rebuild all your payment rails on [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1716.72s)]
*  using US dollar stable coins and [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1722.44s)]
*  It's a no-brainer because I'm spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1725.6s)]
*  Transaction costs that now I can just save and use to hire somebody else or just pay the team more [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1729.3999999999999s)]
*  And so I just think like paying 10% to sub stack and the 3% [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1735.08s)]
*  Yeah, if it's obvious for me, it's obvious for everybody else. All right. My biggest business winner [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1738.8s)]
*  Prediction for 2025 is Tesla and Google. I think this is going to be the year of AI and robotics obviously [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1744.3999999999999s)]
*  But I am just absolutely amazed at the comeback that Google has made [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1751.32s)]
*  With AI and I'm absolutely in awe of what Elon did with Colossus. If those of you don't know [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1755.52s)]
*  Jensen Wong Michael Dell they all obviously participated in building out X AI and they were shocked [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1760.72s)]
*  They couldn't believe that they stood up a hundred thousand GPUs in under 45 days. Was it Gavin? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1767.68s)]
*  Something in that neighborhood. It was a tremendous effort and [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1775.04s)]
*  You know, I just think Tesla right is that Tesla well you on Tesla X AI and Google that cohort who are investing heavily in AI [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1778.68s)]
*  Those two specifically those two three names. I think are going to be the biggest winners next year [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1786.6399999999999s)]
*  They're gonna come out with some things that people didn't [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1791.04s)]
*  Anticipate I don't I don't think people are anticipating [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1793.8799999999999s)]
*  What Google is going to come out with because Gemini deep research? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1796.6399999999999s)]
*  I keep telling people this and I'm using the app is so impressive [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1799.8s)]
*  Drop what you're doing right now pause the podcast download Gemini [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1804.08s)]
*  And just start playing with deep research search on your desktop pay the 20 bucks for it [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1807.48s)]
*  It is mind-blowing it blows anything else in the market out of the water period full stop [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1811.84s)]
*  It is a step function higher [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1818.24s)]
*  All right, I'll just leave it at that Jason. Shouldn't you just go to the vibe the podcast? Can you explain what it is? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1821.24s)]
*  What you're sorry, okay. So what it does is good call good call [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1827.36s)]
*  Yeah, if you wanted to create a model, let's say and I did this where I said, hey make me a model [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1831.52s)]
*  Based upon what it would take to replace all the cars and trips in the United States with full self-driving cars [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1835.56s)]
*  What would that cost to do and if you ask that to? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1841.76s)]
*  Chat GPT or Brock or you know Claude? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1846.3600000000001s)]
*  It's gonna give you a decent answer what deep research does is it goes and it figures out what the sub components of each of those questions [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1849.44s)]
*  Would be and then it fires off multiple threads and then it searches the web in real time [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1855.44s)]
*  Which Google is extremely good at and then it summarizes the results of the research [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1859.96s)]
*  It summarizes it gives citations and it produces a report that looks like something that Gartner group McKinsey [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1865.44s)]
*  Boston consulting group would have spent I don't know 30 days on Gavin and a million dollars a half million dollars. It's [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1870.1200000000001s)]
*  Bonkers how good this is but the amount of compute it takes is extraordinary. That's why chat GPT release something similar [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1878.44s)]
*  that's 200 bucks a month the o1 pro I think they call it and [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1884.96s)]
*  Then this one is like 20 bucks from Gemini. Anyway, given what? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1888.64s)]
*  Google has access to YouTube your g-drive your Google Docs, etc your gmail [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1893.0200000000002s)]
*  It's gonna do things that you wouldn't anticipate like if you were asking this question [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1898.64s)]
*  It might look in your gmail for possibilities to answer those questions or YouTube videos of channels you subscribe to [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1903.1000000000001s)]
*  So this is going to I think knock people's socks off and solve problems that people didn't know they had [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1910.14s)]
*  Is that a pretty good explanation Gavin? Yeah, it's great for last year our predictions for business winner [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1915.66s)]
*  Chema said bootstrapped or end or profitable startups. I think that's a really great pick and that came to pass [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1921.9s)]
*  We're seeing some of those go public and raise money at higher evaluations or not go out of business free break [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1926.34s)]
*  You said commodities businesses. I'm not sure how that did. Do you know did you turn it on that pretty flat? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1932.14s)]
*  Yeah, we didn't have a lot of the inflationary pressures that I think were underlying that thesis [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1937.02s)]
*  So got it and ended up being I'd say a loser relative to other indices you could have bought this year [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1942.58s)]
*  I said training data owners like reddit New York Times Google, etc [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1948.8200000000002s)]
*  Reddit stock up to 24% in 2024 and they launched their own reddit answers. Oh, yeah [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1952.5s)]
*  I think I got that one New York Times stock is up as well and they fired off that lawsuit with open AI [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1958.42s)]
*  All right. Now we're gonna move on to the [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1963.14s)]
*  2025 biggest business loser predictions in 2024. Shammat said pro sports teams because they hit peak valuations [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1965.8200000000002s)]
*  That's looking like a pretty good prediction freeburg [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1973.42s)]
*  You said vertical SAS companies because of AI disruption that's another one that seems like a great prediction [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1975.42s)]
*  I said smartphone manufacturers Apple stock was up 30% in 2024 [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1980.38s)]
*  But I think we've all seen that these smartphones aren't advancing and people are taking their times the sales of those are down [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1985.0200000000002s)]
*  Services are up. I would take the other side on pro sports teams. It feels like that market is about to be institutionalized and [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1991.66s)]
*  Funds are gonna start buying pro sports teams [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=1999.0600000000002s)]
*  Okay, that ultimately and ultimately capital markets have way more resources than kind of the wealthy individuals who've done it for net [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2002.58s)]
*  Today, so I just think it's [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2010.14s)]
*  the amount of money that can go after pro sports teams is about [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2013.18s)]
*  You know 10x 100x I think you're totally right [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2016.98s)]
*  the the reason I said that last year was it was pretty clear to me at the time and [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2020.3s)]
*  the NBA was that canary in the coal mine that there was a viewership problem in professional sports and [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2025.02s)]
*  Specifically in the NBA the game has devolved into essentially rebounds and dunks or three-pointers and [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2030.02s)]
*  The issue with that is that it becomes just meaningfully less interesting to watch [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2039.46s)]
*  At the same time because of the the fact that the TV deals are really what determines the discounted value of these sports franchises [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2043.94s)]
*  The TV deal was so enormous that it creates no [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2052.18s)]
*  Reliable rivalries anymore because people will hopscotch teams almost every year [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2057.34s)]
*  because the compensation that they can get is just so obscene quite honestly and I think what happens is [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2063.34s)]
*  Sports will have a decent run [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2069.54s)]
*  until the next TV deals get done [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2071.78s)]
*  And I think if you for example take [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2074.26s)]
*  Pharma ads outside of TV so like that pool shrinks if you have less viewership [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2077.3s)]
*  And so you can sell the remaining ads [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2084.86s)]
*  Less effectively because there's just fewer of them and then there's fewer buyers and it shrinks yet again [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2087.78s)]
*  then the dollar pool that the television networks and the streamers are going to be willing to pay for sports will go down and [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2093.2200000000003s)]
*  The group that will be the most price sensitive are exactly who you said Gavin meaning the non [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2101.98s)]
*  Trophy buyer so like you know when I bought into the Warriors [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2108.58s)]
*  I bought it purely as a trophy asset and I was price insensitive [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2111.14s)]
*  But I agree with you that now that you have the PE firms on the cap tables of these sports franchises [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2114.38s)]
*  Those folks are all DCFs. Those folks are all Excel models. I don't think that they're buying things for emotion [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2119.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't think they've grown up thinking I want to own this thing not using institutional LP dollars [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2125.86s)]
*  So I just think that's why that's why I said that in 24 [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2131.7s)]
*  So I just on behalf of Phil Hummuth and I we appreciate you made that vanity investment for the number of times [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2134.3399999999997s)]
*  We got to sit in your court side seats [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2139.14s)]
*  I never went to the games. I should have gone to more games [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2144.3399999999997s)]
*  I went to your games and almost got thrown out of your seats. I got a red card one time. It's true [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2146.74s)]
*  Is it true you did? Oh, you know, I got a I got a call [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2151.06s)]
*  I got a call [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2155.3799999999997s)]
*  I think it was from the Warriors or from the NBA something to the effect of chmoth [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2156.1s)]
*  This guy that was sitting in your seats was almost kicked out and I said, excuse me [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2159.7s)]
*  Because I knew that it was the next game in fairness and and he was like jawboning our own players [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2163.34s)]
*  I was getting into it with Bogot and with David Lee [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2169.6200000000003s)]
*  Because I was unbelievable. I told Steve Kerr listen, you're up 30 on my Knicks sit these guys down [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2173.34s)]
*  This is Bush League free. What if Steph Curry gets hurt out there like and you know, Bogot told me to shut up and Andre [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2179.3s)]
*  You go dog it Boga told him to basically go pounce end [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2185.5s)]
*  He basically did it was the funniest they ever Gavin this is what happens when you go gets one of our friends and he's one of [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2188.18s)]
*  Our friends. That's why it's so funny, but if they can't they come over free bird and they tap you on the shoulder [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2193.86s)]
*  I'm with my wife. She's mortified and [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2199.22s)]
*  the guy hands you a card and the card says you've [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2202.1s)]
*  Been warned one time and one time only about abusive, you know [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2205.98s)]
*  Behavior if we have to warn you one more time, you will be escorted out [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2211.3399999999997s)]
*  So I look at the guy and I say but he goes read the card I read the card I say [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2215.7s)]
*  He goes gives me thumbs up [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2220.9s)]
*  You're not supposed to then three years later I'm sitting in the same seats [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2225.06s)]
*  I'm interacting with Draymond during the finals games and then everybody's hokey-dokey with it when you say interacting [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2228.74s)]
*  What do you mean when you say interact? Wait, hold on. Gab. I wanted to make a point about what I just [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2234.62s)]
*  Just just come back to Jamal because I for sure these private equity guys there's DCFs [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2238.66s)]
*  The NBA has been terribly managed. I give LeBron said they have a big problem [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2242.82s)]
*  You know and I'd separate the NBA is the worst managed NFL is probably the best managed [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2247.86s)]
*  but the one kind of counterpoint I would say on the TV rights is [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2252.2200000000003s)]
*  Google bought Sunday ticket and are extremely happy with it [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2256.34s)]
*  Amazon and Netflix also [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2261.38s)]
*  But you know both bought NFL games and are really happy with them [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2263.9s)]
*  And so I just think those three companies it doesn't really matter to them if pharma ads go away [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2267.34s)]
*  In 18 months, you're gonna be able to dynamically create an ad for each individual person and show it to them [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2273.9s)]
*  And if you're a high-value user with a you know, the Google knows that you're about to book a vacation [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2280.38s)]
*  You know, they'll dynamically generate, you know, whatever, you know hotel destinations you want and show click here. So I just think [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2285.98s)]
*  Sports as long as they command the eyeballs that they do and I for sure if the NBA doesn't fix it [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2294.16s)]
*  the value of those franchises will start to decline but um [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2301.44s)]
*  Just the fact that all of the biggest tech companies are so happy with the sports kind of rights that they bought [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2305.96s)]
*  They're gonna buy them all at every [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2312.72s)]
*  Maybe maybe you're closer to this [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2316.96s)]
*  But why wouldn't Apple Amazon or Google just back up the truck to the NBA and say well take the whole thing and then anybody [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2318.6s)]
*  Who's got an iPhone gets the NBA for free and then everybody else has to pay and they figure it out in the back [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2325.88s)]
*  And they lose a you know, five billion. They make two billion who cares. It's a rounding error for Apple [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2331.6s)]
*  I agree and they you know, I mean they all all except for Apple really and Apple they have I think an MLS deal [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2336.64s)]
*  But they all kind of stuck their toe in the water and I think they feel like wow the water's warm let's dive in [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2343.8399999999997s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, and the new deal is an 11-year deal for the NBA. So these things don't come up that often [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2350.52s)]
*  But we'll see over time. Maybe somebody will buy one of these media companies and inherit them [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2356.68s)]
*  Okay, biggest business loser for 2025. What's your prediction Gavin Baker government service providers? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2361.54s)]
*  You do not you do not want to have the United States government at any level is over 35% of your revenue [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2368.96s)]
*  Good choice. Yes, obviously in the age of Doge. They might not be spending wildly and they might actually look at the bill [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2376.3s)]
*  They might check the bill [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2382.34s)]
*  Crazy thought crazy. Yeah crazy thought to actually check the bill. You never know Chamath [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2384.08s)]
*  Who do you predict will be the biggest business loser of 2025? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2388.56s)]
*  Well, this is a little bit [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2393.52s)]
*  Precarious but [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2395.52s)]
*  I [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2398.52s)]
*  Don't know what the percentage drawdown from here will be but I think when we look back [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2400.16s)]
*  the [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2407.12s)]
*  absolute [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2408.12s)]
*  dollar drawdown of the mag-7 [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2409.12s)]
*  Will be in the trillions of dollars [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2413.32s)]
*  Okay, and the reason is not necessarily because of the underlying fundamentals of these companies [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2415.84s)]
*  But I am a little bit worried and I [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2422.24s)]
*  Pweeted this a few days ago about just the general concentration of the top seven eight nine ten companies [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2424.72s)]
*  in the indices I [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2431.88s)]
*  Think it's approaching 40% [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2434.3599999999997s)]
*  And I think that when you look at these historic [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2436.96s)]
*  concentrations, they've generally foreshadowed a big drawdown and [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2440.7999999999997s)]
*  Unfortunately, I don't see how [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2445.6s)]
*  you can [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2448.44s)]
*  Sort of you know inoculate yourself from that risk so [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2450.96s)]
*  Independent of the quality of these companies because I think these companies are exceptional businesses [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2454.4s)]
*  I do think you've just had too much concentration and I think it it is a setup [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2459.2000000000003s)]
*  To retrade and give back and in that it could even be 10% [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2464.8s)]
*  But 10% in the mag-8 will be a couple trillion bucks. And so on a lot. Yeah an absolute dollars a lot [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2469.28s)]
*  Okay, free Berg [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2476.7200000000003s)]
*  Who do you predict you predict Mac seven government service providers for you Gavin free Berg? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2478.2799999999997s)]
*  Who do you predict will be the biggest business loser of 20? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2481.9599999999996s)]
*  I'm not I'm sort of on the same vein as Gavin [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2484.4399999999996s)]
*  I went with the kind of old defense and aerospace providers [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2487.3199999999997s)]
*  Boeing Lockheed Martin Raytheon defense 1.0 driven by kind of China dominance driven by US defense budgets that I think are gonna [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2491.56s)]
*  Need to shift towards a more kind of tech oriented and ROI driven [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2498.8399999999997s)]
*  Rationalization and pricing and spend so the Palantir's and and rules obviously the world will benefit and I also just think like there's a lot of [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2502.76s)]
*  Failure at scale with these businesses. They've gotten too clunky and too bureaucratic as we've seen with Boeing from their space program failure in 2024 [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2509.6400000000003s)]
*  To the challenges with their their airplane business [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2519.2400000000002s)]
*  But I think that this government contracting business across the board is going to be deeply challenged this year with all the new blood [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2522.6400000000003s)]
*  So the cost plus are gonna suffer is what you're saying and the Andrels will thrive [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2529.64s)]
*  Would you guys add just a question? Would you guys add the [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2533.7999999999997s)]
*  Traditional consulting companies then to the mix as well like if you're good. That's a good point, too [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2537.72s)]
*  That's a great one. Yeah, we think what we talked about with deep like the one froze the Tatas the HCL the Accenture [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2542.7599999999998s)]
*  Cognizance [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2549.24s)]
*  The EMY's all these folks that are in real trouble if that if that also happens [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2550.68s)]
*  The efficiency that they'll gain [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2555.16s)]
*  Will also be felt by their customers and their customers might not hire them when you got a bunch of software [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2557.72s)]
*  Entrepreneurs that are now advising and informing the federal government on how to run their their operations [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2562.44s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that some of these service providers are gonna get washed out [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2566.92s)]
*  So it's a good idea the thing to keep in mind is like cost plus [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2570.12s)]
*  Is a fancier way of saying time and materials and time and materials is a fancy way of saying human resources [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2574.12s)]
*  And time and materials is a fancy way of saying human labor arbitrage [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2581.24s)]
*  And I think that all of that stuff will get [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2586.92s)]
*  extremely scrutinized in 2025 [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2590.2s)]
*  Because if you are buying, you know, eight hundred dollar waste baskets and you know, nine thousand dollar umbrella hangers [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2593.24s)]
*  because of time and materials and all of this other [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2600.52s)]
*  Crazy stuff that's in the system and all of that gets washed out [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2603.72s)]
*  Then a lot of these folks and their business models will get put under severe stress the alignments, you know [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2606.84s)]
*  You show me an incentive. I'll show you the outcome the alignment of cost plus is to just keep being inefficient and [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2611.8s)]
*  And waste and and these defense contractors are taking 60 70 80 off the price of each piece of munitions or vehicle [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2619.4s)]
*  Yeah [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2628.6800000000003s)]
*  Cost plus is terrible. No, just cost is terrible. That's all right for my biggest business loser prediction [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2630.0400000000004s)]
*  I had to go through a lot of the [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2635.16s)]
*  people i've [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2638.3599999999997s)]
*  criticized [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2639.3199999999997s)]
*  I didn't start in fights with over the past year [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2640.68s)]
*  Commercial real estate came to mind because these leases are going to keep coming up [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2643.16s)]
*  And I think like they kicked the can down the road a little bit. So I started there [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2646.92s)]
*  Then I looked at micro strategies and that made no sense to me that they were trading at two three four times [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2650.8399999999997s)]
*  The book value of their bitcoin and I think that's not sustainable [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2656.52s)]
*  I looked at truth social which is like [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2660.12s)]
*  Doing four or five million dollars in revenue and is valued at seven billion. That makes absolute no logical sense [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2662.68s)]
*  But I think the one that is the most overpriced of of all this and I think is going to see [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2668.7599999999998s)]
*  Their peak valuation is open ai. I think the headwinds for open ai are being absolutely [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2675.4s)]
*  Under appreciated [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2683.3199999999997s)]
*  Like I said before my previous one my previous prediction google is kicking ass [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2685.3199999999997s)]
*  Xai is just getting started and building out so much [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2690.2799999999997s)]
*  big iron [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2693.88s)]
*  Microsoft was basically on another podcast [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2695.38s)]
*  Almost like laughing at open ai for selling them the source code and that they didn't even need open a anymore because they had it all [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2699.56s)]
*  They don't need them and they own all the big iron [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2705.56s)]
*  I think open ai's valuation made no sense [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2708.2s)]
*  I don't think they're going to be able to keep charging the prices are charging and I think aws [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2711.08s)]
*  apple [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2716.6s)]
*  Google xai this cohort are going to [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2717.72s)]
*  really [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2722.7599999999998s)]
*  Take that 157 billion dollar valuation and make it the peak valuation of the company and I do [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2724.12s)]
*  I do think that there is a non-zero chance they could lose [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2730.6s)]
*  their [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2734.52s)]
*  Process and these court cases of transferring [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2735.4599999999996s)]
*  157 billion dollars in value from a non-profit into a for-profit. I think that whole thing could blow up [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2738.8999999999996s)]
*  Is that your super prediction is open ai will not be able to convert from non-profit for profit in 2025 [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2745.32s)]
*  I think that that's a small piece of it, but that's a really interesting super prediction insert polymarket graphic here [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2750.52s)]
*  Super prediction [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2758.2000000000003s)]
*  Will open ai convert is that's a good 2025. Yeah, by the way, you know [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2759.64s)]
*  They're projecting I think in the the the leaked financials 12 billion revenue next year jcal [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2764.04s)]
*  So unlike a lot of the other things you're talking about [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2769.64s)]
*  This is a real business with real revenue real scale real growth real technology [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2771.88s)]
*  It's a little bit distinct from kind of being a meme stock or being a exactly [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2776.52s)]
*  That's why i'm picking it because I think it's easy to pick a meme stock. It's harder to pick a real company [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2780.84s)]
*  But I do think that that revenue which you know, a lot of it is consumer and a lot of it is developers [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2786.2000000000003s)]
*  The developers I know all want to do open source. They don't want to have to be beholden [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2792.04s)]
*  To open ai and sam altman they would much rather [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2797.08s)]
*  And they're already setting their queries across multiple different sacks and trying different ones [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2800.76s)]
*  I don't think there's any loyalty to open ai or gemini or any of these services. I think they'll just go with eventually [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2805.0s)]
*  Open source in many cases. So anyway, that's my thought on open ai 2025 biggest business deal [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2811.56s)]
*  What do you got chamath? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2817.16s)]
*  What's your biggest business deal for 2025 prediction chamath? What do you got? You said starlink to go public last year [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2819.0s)]
*  That hasn't happened yet. Yeah, totally with that one. I think [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2824.84s)]
*  That this is the year that we will see the collapse of the traditional auto oems [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2829.32s)]
*  and I think that the [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2835.64s)]
*  The deal that happened at the end of 2024 with honda nissan [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2838.7599999999998s)]
*  I think is a bit of a signal to what the industry has to do, which is to go through a massive wave [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2843.32s)]
*  of consolidation [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2849.88s)]
*  I think that tesla [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2851.4s)]
*  Is just in an incredible [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2853.8s)]
*  Position with the quality of their vehicles and the quality of their software [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2856.28s)]
*  And the quality of their autonomy with fsd [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2860.6000000000004s)]
*  so I suspect that [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2863.88s)]
*  after a couple of [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2866.6000000000004s)]
*  more [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2868.44s)]
*  meaningful [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2870.04s)]
*  Product releases, it's just going to trigger the realization by the public capital markets [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2872.2000000000003s)]
*  That these auto oems are uninvestable and I think the result of that will be [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2877.96s)]
*  A wave of auto mega mergers [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2883.3999999999996s)]
*  And for people who don't know honda and nissan signed an agreement [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2887.3999999999996s)]
*  To merge and mitzvah is involved because they're part of I think nissan's alliance [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2891.56s)]
*  This would obviously get rid of all of the redundancy [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2896.2s)]
*  But yeah, I think this is going to touch like the european oems are in real trouble. You know, what does volkswagen do? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2899.96s)]
*  It's not clear. What does stillantis do? It's not clear. These are all businesses that are effectively [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2906.68s)]
*  Melting icebergs and so, you know typically melting iceberg businesses [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2912.12s)]
*  When they get put under pressure from smart investors like gavin and and and his ilk [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2917.08s)]
*  They're forced to merge [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2923.08s)]
*  Are you sure these gavin gavin you got a spread trade? Are you short these names? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2924.76s)]
*  um, I [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2928.6s)]
*  I would rather not talk about specific positions. I would just say I agree 100 with chamath. I think all right there you go [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2930.04s)]
*  They're going to lose their chinese business because they don't make competitive products anymore [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2936.44s)]
*  if [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2941.4s)]
*  There's not massive protectionism and we're seeing signs that they'll be caught between tesla and the chinese oems [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2942.2000000000003s)]
*  and I think the only way that this doesn't [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2949.1600000000003s)]
*  Chamath's the only risk to chamath's prediction is just government intervention because they're such big employers [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2952.52s)]
*  And you know often seen as national champions, but absent really significant government support [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2959.32s)]
*  They're all in deep trouble [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2966.52s)]
*  Okay, well done freeberg last year [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2969.32s)]
*  You said there'd be some blockbuster deals for rights holders licensing data for ai training and reddit did in fact sign two of us [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2973.08s)]
*  So a great prediction from you for last year on biggest business deal. What do you got this year? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2979.08s)]
*  See if you can go two for two. Was it just reddit? [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2984.04s)]
*  I should probably look it up [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2987.64s)]
*  What do you got? I'll just follow on my year of the robot theme. I do think that there's going to be massive funding deals [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2990.36s)]
*  Similar to what we saw this past year for compute build out. I think we're going to see massive funding deals [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=2997.24s)]
*  For hardware based manufacturing build out in the united states, and I think that those deals may take the form [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3002.92s)]
*  of kind of traditional equity [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3009.88s)]
*  from private markets [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3012.2s)]
*  Or they may have some component that includes government support [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3013.8s)]
*  To to kind of motivate and drive and accelerate onshore manufacturing. We're not going to go in the u.s [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3017.96s)]
*  To making stuff that is like last century. I think we're going to need to move manufacturing to the next decade next century of [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3024.2s)]
*  Of production I think that's going to mean making some of these autonomous and robotic type systems that are going to become really critical [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3032.12s)]
*  For us, particularly with china doing this massive ramp up and build out for both drones and robots [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3038.52s)]
*  And autonomous vehicles, so I think we're going to need to kind of onshore a lot of this and so that'll be a big [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3046.2799999999997s)]
*  Amount of capital that's going to move in so you'll see a bunch of these big blockbuster deals for hardware build out in the u.s [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3050.6s)]
*  Gavin, what do you think should be the biggest business deal in 2025? [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3055.7999999999997s)]
*  I think the biggest business deal is that they're going to be deals [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3059.64s)]
*  I think there's going to see a tidal wave of m&a after four years of not being able to get anything done [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3063.24s)]
*  I think there's an enormous amount of pent up demand [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3069.0s)]
*  So kind of point number one point number two something will happen with intel and that will be big and hopefully it's good for america [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3073.16s)]
*  and then [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3080.68s)]
*  I do think you will see a lot of these frontier ai labs that are independent be acquired [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3082.4399999999996s)]
*  You know, I thought your points were well taken jason about you know everything that uh, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3088.04s)]
*  You know google is bringing to bear and xx ai owns their own compute [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3092.68s)]
*  when you guys can choose whichever one of these three you like but [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3097.08s)]
*  The ultimate ai winner will be the one with the lowest cost [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3100.52s)]
*  Of infrastructure costs the lowest cost of compute [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3105.08s)]
*  And definitionally, you can't be the low cost provider if you're renting your compute from someone else [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3107.96s)]
*  because of markups [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3113.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, because there's a markup if you're buying your compute from azure or aws [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3115.2400000000002s)]
*  Or google [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3120.1200000000003s)]
*  You were at a disadvantage relative to their internal services over time [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3121.8s)]
*  So the full stack wins great prediction for me [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3126.36s)]
*  Last year [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3131.2400000000002s)]
*  My prediction was that bite dance would go public or tick tock would get divested or some version of this [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3132.44s)]
*  We are but 18 days away from figuring out if the supreme court will do just that [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3138.12s)]
*  My prediction for this year. I was looking at all the media companies gentlemen. There were so many [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3142.6s)]
*  Possibilities there warner brothers. We talked about apple and disney, you know a couple years ago [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3147.46s)]
*  But I think the age of autonomy is here and I think [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3153.32s)]
*  There is going to be [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3157.56s)]
*  Some partnerships that will happen between amazon doordash uber tesla waymo and that cohort [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3159.72s)]
*  And I would not be surprised to see tesla could buy uber right now for but 10 of its market cap [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3166.68s)]
*  And waymo could spin out and partner with uber [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3172.52s)]
*  Amazon could buy doordash fairly easily and with the wrath of con being over [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3176.2799999999997s)]
*  The wrath of lena con being over gavin [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3181.4s)]
*  It is possible that mega deals like these could go through and if a couple of mega deals go through like this [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3184.36s)]
*  Whoever, uh, you know teams up here could win autonomy delivery food delivery and e-commerce [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3191.32s)]
*  This is a ginormous space [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3198.12s)]
*  And I think listen, I don't I haven't spoken to uh, obviously my friend about it [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3200.04s)]
*  But tesla buying doordash and uber or amazon buying doordash and uber [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3205.08s)]
*  Could be the greatest service ever created if you wanted to build a super app the only thing I would add and I think [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3209.96s)]
*  dovetails with what you said and [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3215.72s)]
*  and um friedberg's kind of year of the robot [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3217.7999999999997s)]
*  Is autonomous drones? There's a company called zipline, which my firm is an investor in [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3221.08s)]
*  Fantastic. Yeah, but autonomous drones. They really are the best way to deliver almost anything [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3226.3599999999997s)]
*  to suburban america [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3233.72s)]
*  and then I think [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3235.48s)]
*  Over time it will be sorted out so that they could deliver in cities as well [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3237.16s)]
*  So I just think that that might be a little bit of a wild card for some of these delivery services [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3242.44s)]
*  Well and amazon in I believe it's texas is actually doing these now [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3247.64s)]
*  They've got 60 000 skews is my understanding already being delivered and they just drop it in your backyard and it's there in 45 minutes [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3252.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, we talked about this like two weeks ago. I um, you know [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3259.96s)]
*  Meituan in china's got this and they they have food delivery happening with these drones [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3262.44s)]
*  By the way, um, just kind of dovetailing off of this. I think the other big deal potential in 2025 [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3266.92s)]
*  Just to be very specific is a deal with waymo. You know waymo launched in sf in august 2023 in kind of an open market way [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3272.0400000000004s)]
*  Uber and lyft were 66 and 34 percent market share at the time and in 15 months in november of 2024 [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3279.6400000000003s)]
*  Waymo is now a 22 market share of rides in sf [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3286.6800000000003s)]
*  Which is the same as lyft and uber is now down to 55 [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3290.8399999999997s)]
*  So waymo ate into both uber and lyft's market share by on the order of 12 points [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3294.2s)]
*  In just 15 months and now they're launching in la in austin all over the country. They're already in phoenix [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3299.48s)]
*  So I think you could see a massive and by the way, you know [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3306.12s)]
*  They also just moved the hardware platform over to a new drop new device [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3308.2s)]
*  That's supposedly going to bring the capex significantly down for new launches [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3312.12s)]
*  So you'll see much improved ro ic metrics, which means that there's a much kind of more efficient way to use capital to scale [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3316.2s)]
*  So the system works it is scaling they're opening up in new markets [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3322.92s)]
*  You could see something happen with waymo this year that could either be something like a massive financing an ipo [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3326.92s)]
*  Or a merger or acquisition with one of the big ride sharing companies [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3332.52s)]
*  I don't know if that makes as much strategic sense as i've thought about it a little bit [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3335.88s)]
*  But I do think you could see a big deal with waymo this company [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3339.08s)]
*  Is if you guys have not been in a waymo [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3342.12s)]
*  I think we all talked about this but it's an incredible experience and everyone I know [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3344.52s)]
*  Of every age group that has been for a ride in waymo comes out of it saying that is the future [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3348.28s)]
*  This is going to absolutely dominate how i'm going to get around clearly. It's the future most people say it's slow right now [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3352.84s)]
*  And monotonous and they don't like it, but you know because it does take weird routes, but that'll be fixed over time [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3358.68s)]
*  Obviously and uh, just in case anybody thinks i'm talking my book here [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3363.94s)]
*  I have exposure to all these almost all these companies in a in a significant way because I believe in the entire space [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3367.88s)]
*  One and a half percent of rides in the u.s [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3373.8s)]
*  And globally, it's less than one percent are done by ride sharing [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3376.52s)]
*  The tam is going to go to 20 in a very short period of time and it's going to be across the board [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3380.04s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of winners here [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3385.56s)]
*  And to my favorite uber, obviously they have deals with eight people and it's a global market [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3387.88s)]
*  Byd produces cars for half the price of any other car manufacturer and they have full self-driving and it's pretty darn good from what I understand [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3392.7599999999998s)]
*  So this is going to be a global competition [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3400.6s)]
*  And that means if you want to win that global competition is something like uber and door dash [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3403.16s)]
*  Waymo amazon byd you're going to see some interesting partnerships happen very quickly [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3408.52s)]
*  I believe because there's so much at stake. All right, any final thoughts on biggest business deals? I think I maybe have a good one here [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3413.3999999999996s)]
*  Consolidation in the transportation space. Okay [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3420.66s)]
*  moving on to [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3423.08s)]
*  2025 most contrarian belief [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3425.54s)]
*  Last year enterprise value of open ai goes down from chamath. It roughly doubled [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3429.0s)]
*  But I just picked it as my prediction. So I think we're [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3433.7999999999997s)]
*  We're simpatico on what we think long term freeburg [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3437.16s)]
*  You said increased probability of a nuclear weapon being used for the first time since world war two [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3440.2s)]
*  Thank the lord that that didn't happen again. This is contrarian beliefs people are going out there [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3445.08s)]
*  I didn't predict it was going to happen. I just said the probability went up. It was it's a tough [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3449.56s)]
*  It's a tough thing to call. Well, this is most contrarian belief. I think it's fine. Dr. Doom strikes again. It's all good [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3453.0s)]
*  I picked apple would become the player in ai and they did launch apple intelligence, but it sucks [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3458.84s)]
*  I mean it [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3465.24s)]
*  Sucks. It's terrible. I just bought the google pixel fold 9 [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3466.68s)]
*  And the gemini works perfectly it does everything that's serious supposed to do if you say please play [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3472.92s)]
*  This song if you say please download this app if you say add this to my calendar [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3479.24s)]
*  It does it and it does it in one fifth or tenth the amount of time that apple takes [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3483.96s)]
*  And apple gets it wrong [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3490.52s)]
*  Every time it's a piece of garbage [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3492.28s)]

*  But it's a quarter of a billion dollars to connor magregor. How did we get in on this grift freeberg versus baker? [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3615.0s)]

*  a banking crisis in one of the major mainline banks [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3646.68s)]

*  box one [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3658.8399999999997s)]
*  well, I think if I had to kind of build [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3660.12s)]
*  the [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3662.8399999999997s)]
*  The case for this it would be along the following lines if you added up [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3664.2799999999997s)]
*  the total indebtedness of pax america, which is [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3670.04s)]
*  us government debt [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3674.3599999999997s)]
*  Plus corporates plus mortgage debt [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3677.24s)]
*  And you actually sensitize it to [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3682.6s)]
*  Rates that are around call it five percent [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3687.48s)]
*  What you quickly realize is on a dollar basis [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3691.7999999999997s)]
*  That because the amount of debt that we have has just massively exploded [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3696.2799999999997s)]
*  That five percent rates today on [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3701.42s)]
*  seventy odd trillion dollars [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3704.94s)]
*  Is actually equivalent to ten percent rates [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3707.42s)]
*  25 or 30 years ago because we only had a fraction of that debt on a dollar basis [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3711.58s)]
*  And so the pain that you feel at five or six percent can very quickly ripple through the economy [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3717.58s)]
*  The way that it did when rates 25 or 30 years ago were ten percent [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3724.22s)]
*  And so I think that when people look at rates they forget [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3728.3s)]
*  the [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3732.1400000000003s)]
*  actual total dollar impact because when somebody or collectively [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3733.02s)]
*  When we have to come up with three or four trillion dollars. How do you do that? [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3737.26s)]
*  And so I think that there is a [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3742.2200000000003s)]
*  non-trivial risk. I think it's small. This is why it's contrarian, but I think it's a [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3744.46s)]
*  It's a risk where if you have a mark to market problem [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3748.94s)]
*  If you have a credit balance [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3753.98s)]
*  If you have a credit default problem amongst the corporates or amongst enough individual consumers [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3756.46s)]
*  What I think that happens more than anything else is that it triggers a reserve issue [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3764.46s)]
*  And I think that the reserve issue in one of these mainline banks [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3771.58s)]
*  I have two that I think are more obvious than others, but I don't want to name them. Okay [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3777.5s)]
*  Fair enough. I love this contrarian take. This is great [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3782.7s)]
*  I think that there's a there's a small but reasonable chance that that happens. I love it [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3785.5800000000004s)]
*  It's a great great contrarian take small chance, but big impact [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3789.42s)]
*  Gavin, what do you got? Well first you want to respond to him and I deep research to um [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3793.82s)]
*  Just ask it to look at the total, you know pax americana debt outstanding [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3798.6200000000003s)]
*  apply the [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3803.5800000000004s)]
*  current market interest rate to it [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3805.42s)]
*  And then look at that [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3807.7400000000002s)]
*  You know interest expense relative to gdp and generate that chart over time that would be a cool chart that would be interesting [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3809.9799999999996s)]
*  I don't I don't I don't disagree with chamath [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3818.06s)]
*  You know any [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3822.54s)]
*  anything is possible and [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3824.3799999999997s)]
*  You know there there could for sure be be a problem at a big bank [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3827.4199999999996s)]
*  I don't know that I would say it's likely but you know, anything is possible my most contrarian belief [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3832.14s)]
*  So I think that america over the next [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3836.62s)]
*  At some point over the next four years will print at least one year of greater than [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3839.58s)]
*  Five percent gdp growth real gdp growth [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3844.54s)]
*  I think productivity is going to go vertical because of ai and deregulation [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3848.2999999999997s)]
*  And I think there could be a world where this is the late 90s [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3852.94s)]
*  And it doesn't sound like a big difference, you know five or six percent versus two or three percent, but it is a massive difference [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3857.2599999999998s)]
*  You know at five or six percent, you know, the economy is doubling [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3863.82s)]
*  You'll call it every 12 years roughly [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3868.1400000000003s)]
*  First 24 years at three percent. I mean, it's just it's a massive difference [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3871.26s)]
*  In terms of kind of the wealth of the country and individual americans as far as a specific prediction for 25 [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3875.9s)]
*  Because I don't know when that will happen. I think you will see the frontier labs stop releasing their leading edge models [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3882.3s)]
*  To prevent knowledge distillation and their ip effectively being stolen, you know deep seek from china. It was really impressive [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3887.98s)]
*  But it thinks it's gpt4 [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3895.18s)]
*  You know [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3897.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3898.86s)]
*  So I just think you will you'll see the labs keep their best models in house distill them and put small small models out [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3899.5s)]
*  over time [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3907.82s)]
*  Friberg, you have a contrarian belief and I did put into gemini advanced 1.5 pro with deep research the question which back in the day [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3909.34s)]
*  The greatest chance of being insolvent or having a financial collapse or crisis, so it's doing its research right now [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3915.42s)]
*  It'll be done in about 10 minutes. I think [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3920.62s)]
*  Which gives you an idea of how much research it does. It's nuts [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3923.02s)]
*  Friberg, what do you got? I think that the the party line is that socialism was defeated in this [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3927.1800000000003s)]
*  Election cycle and that there was a resounding kind of vote from [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3935.1s)]
*  The american populace against socialism [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3939.9s)]
*  And I actually think my contrarian belief is that we'll see a rise a dramatic rise [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3942.14s)]
*  in [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3946.7s)]
*  Socialist movements in 2025 in the united states [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3947.98s)]
*  Okay, and I think that we are going to see as gavin pointed out an acceleration of progress. We're going to see an unleashing [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3951.1s)]
*  of economic growth [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3957.1s)]
*  Because of deregulation and ai but I do think that some [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3959.5s)]
*  Markets we've also talked about the the the downfall of us automate manufacturing and the [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3963.2599999999998s)]
*  The downfall of us automate manufacturing and some other industries there's going to be a real significant shift in 2025 [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3969.34s)]
*  Some industries and some companies are going to be huge winners and some companies are going to be huge losers [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3977.02s)]
*  There's going to be some parts of the economy that are going to be big winners and some parts of the economy that are going to [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3981.82s)]
*  Be big losers when you have this sort of a change this fast [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3985.82s)]
*  There are often large contingents of people that are left behind and when that happens [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3989.5s)]
*  I do think that the socialist policies and the socialist movements gain steam [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3993.7400000000002s)]
*  When perrone came to power in argentina [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=3998.7799999999997s)]
*  In the mid 1940s that country was experiencing eight percent GDP growth to gavin's point about accelerating growth [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4002.3799999999997s)]
*  Growth does not mean that it benefits everyone equally [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4009.9s)]
*  And I think that some folks will see people go from being billionaires to hundred billionaires to the world's first trillionaire [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4012.7s)]
*  And it will also start to fuel this rise [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4018.2999999999997s)]
*  So I think that we will see an increase in the breadth and depth of socialist movements in the united states [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4020.54s)]
*  By the way, particularly with doge cutting government funding to programs that benefit individuals [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4026.54s)]
*  Employment being cut in in the federal government and through federal contractors. There's just a lot of rapid change [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4031.8999999999996s)]
*  That's about to kind of really upset a lot of people [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4037.58s)]
*  I totally agree. I think ai [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4040.62s)]
*  you know [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4042.8599999999997s)]
*  People are fond of saying that we're in a world of agi or asi [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4044.06s)]
*  Money will be meaningless [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4048.22s)]
*  But for a short period of time money will matter more than it's ever mattered before [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4050.4599999999996s)]
*  Because the amount of money you can spend [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4055.9799999999996s)]
*  on ai on test time compute [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4059.2599999999998s)]
*  Is going to give you a massive advantage whether you're a company or an individual. So I just think ai is going to really amplify [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4062.2999999999997s)]
*  Inequality for some period of time [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4069.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I hope i'm wrong. Like I hope you know ai leads to you know, all sorts of you know opportunities being created for [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4072.14s)]
*  There's a lot of there's a lot of there's just going to be a lot of employment and income disruption in 2025 and [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4078.54s)]
*  It's going to fuel [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4084.94s)]
*  socialist movements and I think that this is going to be a more difficult year everyone thinks it's kind of [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4086.38s)]
*  Rosy red because we're all working in the tech industry in silicon valley [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4090.86s)]
*  But the reality on the ground for most americans could be a lot harsher than any of us anticipate [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4094.86s)]
*  And that could make for a very difficult political environment and social environment. This is a great contrarian prediction freeberg [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4099.900000000001s)]
*  I would build on it that I don't think this is just going to hit blue collar [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4105.82s)]
*  I'm seeing in the venture industry and in entrepreneurs [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4109.9800000000005s)]
*  All over the place people who are super qualified who had six figure salaries even to mid six figure salaries [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4113.68s)]
*  Not be able to find work or not find work at previous compensation levels. Why? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4119.76s)]
*  Because people are doing more with less. It's much better to invest and do deep research and ai [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4124.56s)]
*  and automate stuff or deprecate stuff or [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4130.4800000000005s)]
*  Delegate stuff to other regions than to hire americans in some cases [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4134.240000000001s)]
*  And that philosophy that's happening isn't just going to hit truck drivers. It's going to hit developers potentially designers writers [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4139.679999999999s)]
*  What you guys are saying what's the contrarian part socialism socialism is going to rise [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4148.48s)]
*  I think it's pretty interesting [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4155.12s)]
*  Because I think you don't think it's contrary. I think the party line has been that socialism was getting [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4157.04s)]
*  Knocked back this year with this election cycle and it was a mandate against socialism [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4163.759999999999s)]
*  And some of the socialist policies that were being put forth [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4168.099999999999s)]
*  And I think that the contrarian view is that we're actually got this really wrong and socialism is going to be on a big rise [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4171.22s)]
*  But just to build on what you said earlier, like wokeism and progressivism will decouple from socialism [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4177.38s)]
*  I think wokeism and progressivism [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4184.18s)]
*  You know will be on a declining trend but socialism in terms of the government [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4187.54s)]
*  Like policies, you know having more of a role. Yeah. Yeah [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4192.98s)]
*  Why don't we have universal why don't we have universal health care? [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4196.0199999999995s)]
*  Why don't we have pre-k or you know in every state and you know, these kind of things [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4199.62s)]
*  I think americans are right to ask those questions [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4204.179999999999s)]
*  Now other behaviors are obviously abhorrent [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4207.94s)]
*  But you do have the right to ask why we can't figure this out and why our government has failed us in something as basic [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4209.94s)]
*  as you know providing after-school programs or [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4215.94s)]
*  Universal health care or universal child care these things are easy to do [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4219.7s)]
*  And when you see everybody getting rich and the polarization of wealth I can understand people saying [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4223.86s)]
*  Why don't we have these basic things when other countries have them? [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4228.1s)]
*  It's a reasonable but you're making the assumptive statement that these things are easy to do which was what was said about education [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4230.74s)]
*  It's like let's give everyone access to college education [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4236.34s)]
*  With the the federal student loan programs and what happened was when we introduced those programs [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4239.38s)]
*  Those schools started to charge more and the tuition went up every year and eventually the cost of education inflated away from the benefit [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4244.74s)]
*  You're getting from it and this has happened universally in health care. It has happened in housing. It has happened in education [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4251.62s)]
*  It has happened in every market where the united states where the government has stepped in to provide capital to support that market [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4257.94s)]
*  Is that the market basically no longer operates in a free way? [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4265.62s)]
*  I appreciate the challenge to it and i'll explain to you why I believe it's easy [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4268.66s)]
*  If you just put this down to the states and you make it more competitive [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4272.34s)]
*  I think you solve the problem if you introduce school vouchers and you create competition [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4275.38s)]
*  If you take universal health care and maybe you run some experiments where different states get that money from the federal government [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4279.24s)]
*  And let them run 50 different experiments [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4285.72s)]
*  I think we could actually solve some of these problems [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4287.8s)]
*  But you're correct anything that the federal government does it eventually becomes corrupt and inefficient [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4289.64s)]
*  My most contrarian belief was open ai loses its lead [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4294.04s)]
*  Loses its non-profit to for-profit [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4297.780000000001s)]
*  Transition and becomes the number four player in ai the total [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4301.62s)]
*  Collapse of open ai is my most contrarian prediction for 23. That's a good one the total collapse [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4306.12s)]
*  Doubling doubling and tripling down [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4312.919999999999s)]
*  Hey, man, i'm trying to make this spicy. It's a spicy category. Let's do it. Yeah. I got it [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4315.32s)]
*  Still run for president jake health, maybe he's great. I don't know everybody who all his friends left the company. Maybe he's great [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4321.719999999999s)]
*  Maybe he's a stand-up guy. I mean everybody quit but maybe he's [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4328.12s)]
*  Gavin are you are you familiar with jake health prediction that jeff bezos is going to run for president? It was [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4332.12s)]
*  That was my I was predicting I wanted him to I wanted to and he bought washington post and he quit the amazon job [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4336.679999999999s)]
*  And he bought a house in washington dc and he went down to mora lago. Don't be surprised if bezos after he gets through his uh, [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4343.48s)]
*  midlife crisis and going to coachella and partying and having a great time which he deserves [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4352.2s)]
*  If he comes back and says, you know what? I want to serve my country [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4357.48s)]
*  I still stand by back and train post or do you think he's gonna hold on to it? [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4359.72s)]
*  Well, let's stick with that one because that's one of my predictions jeff bezos will sell the washington post in 2025 [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4363.64s)]
*  That's a good poly market. Yeah, sell it to carol swisher sell it to karen swisher [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4369.64s)]
*  Yeah, they'll run it right into the ground they'll double down [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4374.92s)]
*  Uh, okay best performing asset everybody loves this one best performing asset [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4378.76s)]
*  Hey, we can we you can put a price on this best performing asset last year. Tramot did a spread trade [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4383.240000000001s)]
*  He was long public tech stocks short private late stage tech stock index [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4388.2s)]
*  NASDAQ top 100 tech stock ETF was up 10 in 2024 freeberg [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4393.8s)]
*  You went with your uranium etf not uranus uranium etf and your a ura [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4398.36s)]
*  Was down 1 in 2024. I know sideways. You know what? [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4405.72s)]
*  I looked at the components of that etf stuff last week when we were preparing for this [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4409.32s)]
*  It has absolute junk in it like it it was not the right [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4414.04s)]
*  the right way to kind of trade [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4417.8s)]
*  uranium, but [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4420.12s)]
*  Anyway, that was my my outcome for the year [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4422.36s)]
*  I went with the on-demand economy with uber airbnb and dordache uber was up 30% [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4425.32s)]
*  But now it's only up 3% with the robo taxi headwind airbnb is basically flat [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4430.92s)]
*  And dordache up big 74% shout out to stanley tang great job to the team over there [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4436.04s)]
*  So chamath get your flowers there. Let's do our best performing asset. Let's let our guests go first gavin [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4440.599999999999s)]
*  What would be the best performing asset of 2025? [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4445.96s)]
*  I think the companies that make high bandwidth memory [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4449.24s)]
*  Going back to we're gonna we're gonna run out of compute [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4452.84s)]
*  It's it's um [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4457.32s)]
*  It's actually a pretty shocking stat [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4460.12s)]
*  High bandwidth memory is a bigger part of invidious cogs on gpus than taiwan simi is [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4462.68s)]
*  And today there's two companies that can make it high next in micron. We'll see if samsung gets their act together [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4468.36s)]
*  But hbm memory it's in nvidia gpus amd gpus amazon traniums [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4475.64s)]
*  And particularly in a world of test time compute and inference being so important high bandwidth memory is arguably [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4483.0s)]
*  More important than it ever was and it's been um, it's been sold out for the last two years [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4494.12s)]
*  So high bandwidth memory would be my pick [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4498.68s)]
*  Okay, good pick great pick. In fact [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4501.400000000001s)]
*  What do you got chamath? So let me preface this by saying that [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4504.92s)]
*  this is a pick that [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4508.280000000001s)]
*  92 times out of 100 goes to absolute zero. Okay [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4511.780000000001s)]
*  And [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4520.04s)]
*  six out of the remaining eight times [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4521.64s)]
*  you make [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4525.08s)]
*  10 extra money [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4526.4400000000005s)]
*  And then the final two times you make anywhere between 100 to 1000 extra money [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4528.280000000001s)]
*  Okay, sounds like okay, so this is a loser trade [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4532.84s)]
*  Okay [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4537.48s)]
*  But I would be long [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4538.599999999999s)]
*  cds [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4540.98s)]
*  So what am I buying? I am buying insurance. I'm buying insurance [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4542.5199999999995s)]
*  Using credit default swaps. I'm buying what's called protection [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4547.639999999999s)]
*  That there is no default event in 2025 [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4551.719999999999s)]
*  Again, i'm not going to tell you [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4556.599999999999s)]
*  which companies or [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4559.32s)]
*  What maturities but just the general idea for me is I would like a little bit of an insurance policy in 2025 [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4561.88s)]
*  So that the men and the women that we have voted in have the chance to do their work in peace [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4570.92s)]
*  I think that there is a small chance [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4577.24s)]
*  of [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4580.92s)]
*  Some volatility next year. I hope it doesn't happen [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4582.5199999999995s)]
*  I hope that this trade like I said 92 times out of 100 loses money. I hope it loses money [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4585.639999999999s)]
*  But if it hits it will be the best performing asset of 2025. It will be the equivalent of akman [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4592.28s)]
*  Buying cds [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4598.599999999999s)]
*  Right at the right at the beginning of the covet crisis. How does one buy those? [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4600.36s)]
*  You have to have an isda you talk to the big investment banks and they'll price it out for you [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4604.36s)]
*  But again, I just and I just want to be clear. This is not something I think will happen [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4608.92s)]
*  It's not something I want to happen [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4612.36s)]
*  But I do think that if you look back [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4615.16s)]
*  In terms of just the tonnage of dollars you can make [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4617.96s)]
*  And the massive risk asymmetry that it presents to you [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4620.92s)]
*  when you look at the concentration of the s&p when you look at just the total gross amount of debt that we have when you [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4624.5199999999995s)]
*  Look at rate spiking all of these things say having a little insurance [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4631.96s)]
*  May not be a bad thing. So [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4637.5599999999995s)]
*  I hope you're not gavin. You're nodding. You want to answer? [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4639.96s)]
*  I was just I was just thinking I mean if you're if you know chamath's prediction of a bank failure is true [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4643.24s)]
*  You absolutely want to own cds [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4648.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean you'll you'll forget a hundred x you'll a thousand x 10 000 x what do you got free bird? [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4651.5599999999995s)]
*  So I went with [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4659.8s)]
*  Chinese tech stocks Chinese tech etfs [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4663.4s)]
*  Wow, I think that the market everyone's kind of dumped chinese tech stocks over the last couple of years [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4667.32s)]
*  Everyone's taken this isolationary stance on positioning portfolios and saying hey, we can't do business with china. It's over [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4672.68s)]
*  But I do think that the trump administration [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4680.360000000001s)]
*  Particularly with their recent request on tik tok being the ban on tik tok being kind of halted [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4682.9800000000005s)]
*  They're trying to line up what I would call kind of like the great deal with china [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4689.08s)]
*  so I don't know anything about what they're actually trying to do, but I think that [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4692.84s)]
*  trump and [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4697.4800000000005s)]
*  Leadership in the u.s [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4699.4s)]
*  government want to kind of open up the chinese market to american companies in order to give chinese companies access to the american market [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4700.44s)]
*  And I think that they're going to get a deal done given the position with china [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4707.48s)]
*  I think that they're very likely to kind of get a deal done. That's one driver [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4710.84s)]
*  I think there's three drivers. The second driver is that obviously the cost of build out of electricity production in china is unfathomable [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4714.36s)]
*  They recently approved a hundred and thirty seven billion dollar hydroelectric dam facility [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4720.84s)]
*  Which is going to add another I think a couple hundred gigawatts of electricity production [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4725.24s)]
*  In that country not to mention all the nuclear build that we've talked about in the past [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4729.72s)]
*  So the cost per kilowatt hour is already lower the amount of electricity available is going up [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4733.72s)]
*  And then I think that the chinese communist party have this incredible ability to throttle up and down [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4738.84s)]
*  free markets and entrepreneurship [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4744.76s)]
*  And this is a moment where you could kind of see them making the throttle go the way towards enabling more innovation [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4746.92s)]
*  More free market activity and it's going to be one of the motivators for them to do a deal [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4752.599999999999s)]
*  So when you put all of this together [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4756.679999999999s)]
*  I do think that there's a lot of chinese tech companies that have been beat up under the assumption that this is going to be a [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4758.28s)]
*  A very difficult conflict with the us in the years ahead and I think that that may not be the case [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4763.88s)]
*  Going into 25 and I think that they're these stocks are pretty cheap [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4768.839999999999s)]
*  I was just looking at alibaba and it trades at a pretty decent multiple [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4771.48s)]
*  It seems like these stocks could be poised for a pretty good run in 25 if the macro works out [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4775.799999999999s)]
*  It feels like a contrarian take. I mean trump [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4781.4s)]
*  I don't think is going to find a way to balance the relationship with china very well [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4784.599999999999s)]
*  And I don't think you can rattle up entrepreneurship after you cut everybody's knees out the last time [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4789.96s)]
*  Plus, I don't trust any accounting statement coming out of china because they could fudge whatever they want [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4795.5599999999995s)]
*  But wow, what a great uh potential, you know buy low sell high the good thing is you'll know [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4800.5199999999995s)]
*  You'll know if i'm right or wrong in a year you can [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4807.24s)]
*  Exactly well, no exactly that's right pull the etf absolutely. Yeah gavin. What do you think of this hot take here from from mr [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4809.48s)]
*  Freiburg [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4815.88s)]
*  Really cheap. I've had a I would call it a no china [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4816.92s)]
*  Guideline ever since the long top financial fraud more than 15 years ago [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4820.42s)]
*  Or it's just amazing. It was you know, uh [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4826.5199999999995s)]
*  a lot of great investors [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4829.24s)]
*  owned it and [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4831.639999999999s)]
*  You know they [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4833.4s)]
*  They talked a great game [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4834.76s)]
*  And they had a western auditor, but then it turned out that the [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4837.320000000001s)]
*  Fraud was happening at the local post office where they were opening up the documents that the local auditors had signed off on [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4841.0s)]
*  Changing them and then sending different documents, you know, you know, whatever fedexing them [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4848.34s)]
*  Yeah, so I just think it's it's a hard place if you're I think if you're not chinese to make money [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4854.360000000001s)]
*  But I tend to agree with a lot of what david said I think trump and she [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4861.72s)]
*  Both want to deal. I think there's a deal to be done that leaves putin out in the cold as I referenced [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4865.5599999999995s)]
*  And if that happens katie bar the door, I mean they're really really high quality companies, you know that are [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4873.0s)]
*  Some of them are mid single digit multiples [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4879.08s)]
*  And they're and it's a big market. So if you did get it right and you do by the way the chinese [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4881.639999999999s)]
*  The chinese companies serve a global market. It's not just the u.s. They serve [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4885.5599999999995s)]
*  Uh, you know africa south america austria, I mean the whole southern hemisphere [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4890.12s)]
*  Well, yeah, if you look at byd that it's all over europe. It's yeah. Yeah, it's it's [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4894.839999999999s)]
*  Look, I mean, I I mean the chinese companies and they have the best unit economics [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4900.28s)]
*  They have the best cost of production. I mean everything is advantaged [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4905.48s)]
*  Particularly if you believe it's the euro the robot there's going to be a kind of a massive demand around the world for automation [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4909.94s)]
*  And for rebuilding manufacturing capacity all over the world [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4918.04s)]
*  And I think that china could service those markets more efficiently than any other kind of country of origin [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4921.4s)]
*  So it's a pretty pretty powerful set of macro drivers as well [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4926.68s)]
*  I think the mac 7 is going to be the best performing asset i'm taking the other side [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4930.68s)]
*  Uh chamath, I think in an earlier prediction said maybe not so much [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4933.96s)]
*  I think that what they've learned in the last couple years is that there is an incredible earnings expansion you can do [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4937.72s)]
*  by not hiring people [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4945.16s)]
*  And outsourcing jobs to other parts of the world and automating and the gains we'll see from [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4946.84s)]
*  AI which they're producing for other companies and for consumers they're applying first internally [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4952.6s)]
*  So the internal application of ai will allow these companies to have earnings growth that people will not be able to comprehend [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4959.16s)]
*  Over the next couple of years, so i'm going with mac 7 [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4967.0s)]
*  We got a lot of different takes here going different directions. What a great episode so far [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4970.360000000001s)]
*  All right, worst performing asset last year. Chamath said late stage tech stock index mostly sas freeburg you put into brilliant [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4976.4400000000005s)]
*  Spread trade short vertical sas long ai cloud providers sas has had a little bit of a rebound but [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4984.12s)]
*  Google a 36 for ai cloud microsoft 14 amazon 46 all in 2024. I said [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4991.16s)]
*  Llm startups like open ai entropic too many players open sourcing will kill [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=4999.14s)]
*  Pricing obviously the one [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5003.879999999999s)]
*  Valuation we can track is open ai and it doubled but I do think all long term have that one work worst performing asset [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5006.28s)]
*  of [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5013.08s)]
*  2025 gavin enterprise application software. Okay, this is basically just about [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5013.96s)]
*  2025 is going to be I think the year of agents particularly in the second half agents just being [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5020.2s)]
*  AI models that can take action on your behalf that can do anything online that a human can do online [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5026.28s)]
*  And [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5032.2s)]
*  If the labs and the big cloud providers [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5033.4s)]
*  Dominate agents, which seems likely going back to you know, the the low-cost producer is going to win [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5037.16s)]
*  Enterprise application software, I think it's going to be in a lot of pain [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5045.0s)]
*  And you know, some of these companies are talking a big big game about agents [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5048.36s)]
*  But at the end of the day, they don't have their own models. They don't own their own compute [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5053.16s)]
*  And I just don't see them being [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5058.2s)]
*  Ultimate winners in the world of agents, you know [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5060.599999999999s)]
*  I can easily I could be wrong because they do you know, they they they have some customer data [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5063.0s)]
*  Maybe a little bit of a data moat and they do you know have strong customer relationships [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5069.719999999999s)]
*  But you know, most companies have relationships with aws google or microsoft as well. So I think enterprise application software will be in pain [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5074.44s)]
*  Okay, and chamoff. What do you got? [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5082.44s)]
*  I think gavin just absolutely nailed it. I'm going to double down [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5084.92s)]
*  on what he said [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5089.0s)]
*  I think that there's a term that that we will start to use more. I started to use it internally at 80 90 over [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5091.24s)]
*  This last year in 2024, which is the software industrial complex [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5098.6s)]
*  These are these large [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5103.24s)]
*  Bloated in many cases [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5106.84s)]
*  Enterprise software companies that effectively have convinced [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5109.08s)]
*  Incredible numbers of organizations to spend a tremendous amount of money [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5112.76s)]
*  essentially wrapping [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5118.360000000001s)]
*  A bunch of heuristics and business rules around a crud database and along with that what they have [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5120.360000000001s)]
*  Perfected really is a go-to-market and sales motion [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5127.160000000001s)]
*  The golf trips the steak dinners, you know, we mentioned this before what alex carp railed against [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5130.4400000000005s)]
*  None of those things affect the business of the company [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5138.6s)]
*  None of those things equate to product value [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5141.48s)]
*  and increasingly in the world of [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5144.68s)]
*  agentic software and ai [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5147.4s)]
*  I think that you can rebuild a lot of these workflows in very efficient ways [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5150.04s)]
*  And I think the go-to-market is going to be driven by [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5154.6s)]
*  CEOs and cfos who start to exert a little bit more pressure on their cios [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5157.94s)]
*  to manage spend [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5163.5599999999995s)]
*  And in that world, I just think that these next generation ai businesses are built frankly an order of magnitude cheaper [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5165.72s)]
*  Than the companies that they compete against and so even if it's just feature for feature the same [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5174.4400000000005s)]
*  I think the software industrial complex these old mainline [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5180.12s)]
*  traditional enterprise software companies [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5184.360000000001s)]
*  I think you're going to start to see fissures in those businesses in 2025 [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5187.320000000001s)]
*  So I I agree with gavin different words, but same result and you put your time and money where your mouth is on this one [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5190.84s)]
*  11 months ago, you found it 80 90 to get 80 percent the traction in [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5197.8s)]
*  In less than a year to me is shocking and I don't think it speaks necessarily. I think we're decent. We're very good [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5204.12s)]
*  We have great engineers [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5210.68s)]
*  But my 30 person engineering team I think does the work of 300 people by next year [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5213.08s)]
*  It'll be doing the work of 3 000 people maybe we'll only grow by 10 or 20 percent [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5217.32s)]
*  So and the reason is we use these tools [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5222.36s)]
*  We're productive to an order of magnitude that I didn't think was possible [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5225.48s)]
*  And as a result, we're just able to price it differently. So even if it's the exact same product [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5229.96s)]
*  Its cost structure is just meaningfully lower [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5235.48s)]
*  and so this is what I mean where [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5238.679999999999s)]
*  the roi calculators get blown up all of the traditional go-to-market motions get blown up because [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5240.5199999999995s)]
*  In an rfp or in any other sales? [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5245.8s)]
*  Environment what you do is somebody says it's a hundred dollars and you show up and you say [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5248.74s)]
*  10 [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5253.08s)]
*  Okay, and at 10, it's still hugely profitable for you [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5254.2s)]
*  And and just to add just one last thing is just you know [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5257.08s)]
*  Fundamentally these enterprise application software companies the software industrial complex and I agree with everything chamath said [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5261.0s)]
*  You know, they're they're fundamentally based on making white collar human employees more efficient [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5266.76s)]
*  And what the ai companies are going to do is just say hey, we're just going to replace that worker and it's just a fundamentally different mentality [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5273.320000000001s)]
*  And this goes shift. Yeah, and it goes to like there may be a lot of pain that accompanies this and you know [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5281.0s)]
*  David's points around the you know, potential rise of of socialism [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5286.84s)]
*  What do you got for worst performing asset? [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5291.64s)]
*  Mr. Freiburg 2020. I'm probably just going to triple underline vertical sass again per se pricing model being challenged [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5294.200000000001s)]
*  Pricing being compressed as companies to explore in-house tools built with ai that replaces [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5301.08s)]
*  These kind of traditional business practices. Yeah, most are gonna be destroyed [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5306.679999999999s)]
*  Geez, this is [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5311.5599999999995s)]
*  It was an yeah, it was an obvious one on my list, but I want to make a different one [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5314.36s)]
*  I want to make a different one. Oh, how about open ai? Do you have anything open ai? No, no [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5318.12s)]
*  Tell me why I mean all the talented people left, but you know, I don't know where they are [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5322.599999999999s)]
*  Where do all the where are they all the other open ai employees are they on vacation? They're skiing too, right? [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5327.08s)]
*  They've all started competitors. Oh, right. That's what happened. Correct. Yeah, they all left to compete and have revenge startups [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5331.5599999999995s)]
*  Wow, that's an interesting trend. Okay [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5337.88s)]
*  So consumers make five big decisions in their life as we all know college spouts kids 12 billion revenue [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5340.28s)]
*  I mean, well, that's that's a projection [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5345.72s)]
*  But also projections sometimes meet reality six billion in losses too david against that 12 billion in revenue [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5348.12s)]
*  Yeah, six billion this year or six billion next year [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5353.48s)]
*  I think the six is for next year, but I yeah, I don't know [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5356.4400000000005s)]
*  I guess it makes sense why they're trying to charge 200 bucks a month now [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5360.4400000000005s)]
*  Up from 20. They got some headwinds. Okay. Listen consumers make five big decisions in their life [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5363.88s)]
*  We know college spouse kids are the obvious ones and then cars and homes and the consumer is up against it with record debt [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5368.84s)]
*  So since you can't trade college spouse kids, really? [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5377.64s)]
*  I think legacy car companies and real estate are going to face [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5381.400000000001s)]
*  Continued headwinds and be terrible assets because listen, we've overbuilt in some cases [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5385.32s)]
*  There's tons of cars on lots and people can't afford homes with these mortgages [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5390.76s)]
*  So I think these are going to be the two worst performing asset are people in the legacy [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5394.6s)]
*  Oems as chamath pointed out in a previous prediction [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5399.4800000000005s)]
*  And then I just think real estate is the same if you look at a place like texas two years in a row housing [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5402.2s)]
*  Values have gone down rent has gone down two years in a row same things happening in other states where they allow you to build [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5406.6s)]
*  And people are leaving states where they don't allow you to build so that's my worst performing asset trade [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5412.04s)]
*  Enterprise was my other choice, but i'll go with something slightly different most anticipated trend for 2025 last year chamath [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5416.6s)]
*  Congratulations, you said last year that bitcoin would hit 100k for the first time nailed it half court shot [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5423.54s)]
*  Well done. I think at the time you made that prediction. It was probably trading. It felt like a layup felt like a layup to you up [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5430.12s)]
*  112 percent [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5435.62s)]
*  Freeberg you said predictive models in ai-driven discovery and pharma and bioengineering. How did that do that prediction? [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5437.32s)]
*  Well, there was a lot of funding and demos won the noble prize and noble price [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5443.4s)]
*  There you go. So it worked out. I picked efficiency in the form of ai advancements in labor and outsourcing [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5447.639999999999s)]
*  And i've seen that a bunch with our investment in athena go to athenawow.com [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5453.32s)]
*  Okay, got my plug in there. Let's go for most anticipated 2025 trend. What do you got chamath? I think that there are a handful of [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5457.96s)]
*  Not to overuse an overused term, but canaries in the coal mine for the end of the deep state [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5466.52s)]
*  And I would like to point to one [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5473.4800000000005s)]
*  which is this [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5476.68s)]
*  Obscure [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5479.700000000001s)]
*  thing called the supplemental loss ratio [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5481.240000000001s)]
*  and essentially what it is is a mechanism [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5484.76s)]
*  that [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5488.84s)]
*  The banks can use [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5490.68s)]
*  To include or not include treasuries and how they calculate reserves, etc, etc [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5493.240000000001s)]
*  Now, why is this an interesting thing? It's not interesting for many people. It's very arcane [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5497.64s)]
*  But if we are unable [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5503.64s)]
*  To manage the debt situation [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5507.4800000000005s)]
*  in 2025 [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5510.280000000001s)]
*  I think what you're going to see [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5513.0s)]
*  Is maneuvering at the edges of these arcane [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5515.4800000000005s)]
*  regulations that effectively [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5519.06s)]
*  Kick the can down the road [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5521.860000000001s)]
*  and [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5523.780000000001s)]
*  There is a chance that that could happen to help the banks [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5524.9800000000005s)]
*  because you know, we believe that [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5528.9800000000005s)]
*  We meaning collectively america that maybe doge won't be as effective as it needs to be that [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5531.700000000001s)]
*  There's still going to need to be you know, 10 20 trillion dollars of debt issuance to refinance to 10 [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5536.740000000001s)]
*  That's maturing this year and to plug holes in the coming years [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5542.18s)]
*  My point in all of this is we don't need to understand the details except [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5546.9800000000005s)]
*  that [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5551.46s)]
*  If we don't move [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5552.820000000001s)]
*  The goalposts here [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5555.06s)]
*  It is a great sign that [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5557.9400000000005s)]
*  The folks that are running the show are the ones that we all elected [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5562.1s)]
*  Okay, so that is my most anticipated trend small [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5565.700000000001s)]
*  arcane [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5569.200000000001s)]
*  Regulatory changes that allow us to kick the can down the road stop in its tracks. This is an example [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5570.64s)]
*  Okay, freeburg you got a most anticipated trend for 2025 [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5576.18s)]
*  My most anticipated trend is around [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5578.82s)]
*  the announcement of [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5582.26s)]
*  Build out of nuclear power in the united states in 2025 [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5584.18s)]
*  As a function of deregulation and some new technologies [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5588.26s)]
*  I do think that this new government [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5592.9s)]
*  Is going to be much more accommodating and it's going to as i've said in the past. I think it's a necessity [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5594.98s)]
*  Just because of the the the rate at which we have to do power build outs [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5600.66s)]
*  To meet kind of competitive demand against china [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5605.62s)]
*  The united states is going to need to add more power electricity production capacity than we can scale up [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5608.5s)]
*  With any other renewable source, so I do believe that nuclear is an inevitability [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5614.179999999999s)]
*  I think that the deregulation will happen in 25 and I do know a lot of very smart people who are actually starting nuclear power companies [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5618.98s)]
*  And have left very good jobs to go and do this in anticipation of this happening in 25. So i'm very bullish [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5627.0599999999995s)]
*  That's the leading indicator for sure when smart people do something with their time. That's a great indicator gavin. What do you got? [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5634.419999999999s)]
*  Uh, I think ai and nick I sent you a chart [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5640.74s)]
*  I don't know if you can flash it up [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5644.179999999999s)]
*  But um, I think ai is going to make more progress [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5646.259999999999s)]
*  per quarter [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5650.179999999999s)]
*  in 2025 [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5651.86s)]
*  That it did per year in 23 and 24 and the reason is just with um [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5653.78s)]
*  With 01 and 03 this is arc a gi it's designed [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5660.0199999999995s)]
*  You know, we keep we keep changing the goal posts for the Turing test and a gi [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5663.46s)]
*  And i'm sure we're going to change it again [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5669.7s)]
*  As we're going to blow through this and I just think what has happened is we were scaling around around one [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5672.099999999999s)]
*  On one axis which was pre-training [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5677.78s)]
*  And then we started scaling around inference time compute and it's very clear that we have now added a third axis of scaling performance [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5680.339999999999s)]
*  And that is reasoning and what this is [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5689.379999999999s)]
*  Is these models? [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5692.02s)]
*  The internet is composed of answers people giving answers [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5693.86s)]
*  and what the models really benefit from [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5698.58s)]
*  Is kind of the internal monologue of somebody getting to that answer [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5701.86s)]
*  And this is you know in ai terms they call it a reasoning trace [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5707.3s)]
*  And it's one reason, you know 18 months ago everybody was like, oh wow [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5710.9800000000005s)]
*  The more code you train a model on the better it does and all sorts of things [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5713.38s)]
*  That have seemingly nothing to do with code [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5717.3s)]
*  But all code you see kind of the reasoning the internal monologue the thought process the step by step [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5720.1s)]
*  And so what's happening is you're using [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5727.46s)]
*  models to generate synthetic data [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5730.1s)]
*  That contains these reasoning traces. So you ask a model, you know solve this problem [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5733.22s)]
*  It has to be a problem that is functionally verifiable that has an answer where we know the answer and we say show your work [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5737.62s)]
*  And we have it do that many many different ways and times [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5743.94s)]
*  And then you pick the best ones and you kind of feed those back into the model you apply some reinforcement learning to it [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5747.3s)]
*  And so now you're scaling along three axes that are multiplicative with each other [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5753.0599999999995s)]
*  and I just [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5759.0599999999995s)]
*  I you know a guy on the google team said [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5761.78s)]
*  tweeted maybe five days ago. It's going to be a straight shot to asi [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5765.22s)]
*  Artificial super intelligence and I think that might be right. Ilya gave a talk at near ips. Ilya suitskever [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5770.16s)]
*  one of kind of the original pioneers of this field and he said something that I thought was [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5776.66s)]
*  Scary and he said these models that reason are inherently unpredictable [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5781.78s)]
*  So the best reasoning models in the world today are the ones that play games the kind of alpha go alpha zero style [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5787.7s)]
*  models and they are constantly making [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5793.46s)]
*  unpredictable moves that no human grand master ever could have come up with [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5796.639999999999s)]
*  And now these models are going to be making similarly unpredictable leaps in all sorts of domains [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5801.14s)]
*  Which you know, hopefully will be awesome but [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5809.14s)]
*  You know might not be yeah [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5811.78s)]
*  Well, they're going to go around corners that people might not have considered that are non-intuitive [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5813.38s)]
*  And then just to circle back and do a little call back here. Remember I asked which banks would have the biggest [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5817.06s)]
*  chance of being insolvent [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5823.22s)]
*  Or having financial collapse or crisis tons of misspellings in there as I typed it while we were talking [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5825.62s)]
*  And you can see what deep my deep research did here [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5829.86s)]
*  It went and said here's what we're going to do [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5833.3s)]
*  We're going to research a bunch of websites and find a list of banks in the u.s [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5834.98s)]
*  Find top banks by us by asset for each one of these banks find their latest financial savings for each of these banks find their capital [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5838.0199999999995s)]
*  Adequacy ratios for each of these banks find their loan laws you get the idea and then it went and it analyzed [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5844.82s)]
*  And then it created a report this took about 10 minutes [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5850.98s)]
*  and when you look [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5853.86s)]
*  It created this final report here where it gave a list chamath of jp morgan bank of america city group yada yada [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5855.46s)]
*  It did a an analysis of each one and at the end you can see all the different websites it pulled [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5862.02s)]
*  It was well over 100 websites that it pulled that's incredible live data from 162 websites [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5869.14s)]
*  And you have to pay for this but it's only 20 a month and its conclusion [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5875.9400000000005s)]
*  This analysis has provided a snapshot of the financial health of some of the largest u.s banks while all banks face [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5880.12s)]
*  Inherent risk city group and wells farg are appeared to be the highest risk of insolvency of financial collapse [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5885.879999999999s)]
*  Compared to jp morgan chase bank of america golmets act city groups recent net loss lower [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5890.5199999999995s)]
*  Cet one ratio and high exposure. I mean you sure look at this now. I don't know how much of this is correct [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5894.98s)]
*  I'm no expert on this [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5899.639999999999s)]
*  But it does seem like it's a pretty good start of where it's getting to and if you haven't used [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5901.16s)]
*  1.5 pro with deep research just go to gemini.google.com. I'm not being paid to say this. I just think it's the best product in the market [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5906.04s)]
*  And it's pretty darn impressive, okay [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5914.2s)]
*  My most anticipated trend for 2025 was alluded to in an earlier prediction. I think by gavin himself [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5917.4s)]
*  Mine is that exits and dpi shower town [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5925.48s)]
*  And we'll have this incredible distribution as the wrath of lina con ends and mna and ipos will surge [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5928.679999999999s)]
*  That is my prediction my most anticipated trend. Okay, let's go to most anticipated media [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5935.639999999999s)]
*  I had two that I was working back and forth from james james guns dc universe with superman coming out this year [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5942.5199999999995s)]
*  I think it's going to be amazing and or season two could be amazing [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5949.32s)]
*  I predict they're going to do a clone wars live action series. If you don't know the clone wars watch it with your kids [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5953.08s)]
*  It's amazing animated series that takes place during the prequels [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5957.5599999999995s)]
*  But I went with a little [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5961.4s)]
*  Of a weird choice here [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5963.5599999999995s)]
*  I think my most anticipated media is seeing what happens with legacy media outlets owned by billionaires [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5964.679999999999s)]
*  Endor people who no longer want to pick aside washington post cnn and la times specifically [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5971.4s)]
*  Are steering towards the middle and trying to get back to classic journalism [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5977.5599999999995s)]
*  The editors are revolting karen swisher is upset [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5982.12s)]
*  And they're adding some right wing voices. It is going to be popcorn time for everybody [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5985.879999999999s)]
*  So enjoy [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5991.72s)]
*  Whatever you want to enjoy star wars. I got a little star wars for you with andrew season two [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5993.4s)]
*  I got a little superman or you can watch the chaos in the editorial newsrooms at washington post and la times [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=5997.4s)]
*  what do you got for most anticipated media chaumont it is the [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6003.96s)]
*  enormity [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6007.9400000000005s)]
*  of [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6009.4800000000005s)]
*  The files that are going to get declassified and released by the trump administration. I think it's going to [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6010.76s)]
*  be [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6017.88s)]
*  unbelievably interesting salacious useful good [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6019.3s)]
*  earnest [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6023.6s)]
*  All of the above so the jfk [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6025.860000000001s)]
*  Files the epstein files ditty files the moon landing [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6029.78s)]
*  Who knows what they find across all of these other fringe quote-unquote conspiracy theories that may turn out to actually have some shred of truth [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6035.3s)]
*  but [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6041.7s)]
*  All of that let's call it content for lack of a better word that gets released in [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6042.5s)]
*  2025 by the trump administration, I think will be [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6046.5s)]
*  Incredibly interesting. What do you got to media any anticipated media for you? What do you got? I'm into ai video games [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6049.44s)]
*  The cost of production comes way down when you use ai and you can have dynamic storylines [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6056.74s)]
*  You can have new gameplay concepts things that don't exist today [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6061.46s)]
*  I think that the creative talent plus the technical talent that you typically find at development houses can be kind of unleashed with tools [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6065.54s)]
*  That have come to come to market recently. We've seen a lot of degenerative video stuff [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6071.38s)]
*  But there's also ways structurally that video games can kind of be rebuilt where the video game engine can run kind of locally can be [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6075.38s)]
*  Generating parameters that can then use an existing rendering engine so you can have entirely new storylines and entirely new kind of plot sequences [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6081.78s)]
*  So I do think that there's going to be a rewrite of video games in the video game industry [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6089.78s)]
*  with the [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6094.74s)]
*  variety of ai kind of capabilities that are hitting market now and [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6095.86s)]
*  It's going to be incredible. It's going to be incredible entertainment people are going to [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6099.22s)]
*  People that don't play video games are going to find stuff that they're going to love [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6102.9800000000005s)]
*  Gavin most anticipated media 2025 unquestioned 1923 season two. I'm normally a science fiction [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6106.42s)]
*  Kind of fantasy or you know spy [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6114.9800000000005s)]
*  Kind of guy when it comes to tv [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6119.38s)]
*  But 1883 and 1923 were the first tv shows that kind of hit me the way game of thrones did and i'm crazy excited for that to come out [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6121.22s)]
*  Fantastic are you watching landman? I'm enjoying landman. I haven't watched it yet. I'm excited to try it [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6129.06s)]
*  It's quite fun quite fun turns out this guy taylor shiridan. He's I mean, it's incredible. He's in the zone [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6134.900000000001s)]
*  I highly recommend day of the jackal. I know chamath also loved day of the jackal. Oh, that was really good. That was [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6142.42s)]
*  That was a good suggestion for streaming. Yeah, i'm excited. It was incredible. It's the cario. Yeah [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6148.82s)]
*  Absolutely. What was our predictions for for this last year? [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6154.9800000000005s)]
*  Last year chamath predicted mr. Beast freeberg ai generated news [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6158.5s)]
*  I predicted gladiator 2 and the three-body problem gladiator 2 was mid but [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6163.9400000000005s)]
*  Okay, three-body problem. I didn't finish so I guess mid jimmy's [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6169.3s)]
*  Show on amazon prime the mr. Beast thing was [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6174.26s)]
*  The top unscripted drama in 140 of 180 countries [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6177.38s)]
*  Wow, incredible. All right, we're going to do our prediction markets here. I'm going to put up a prediction market [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6182.18s)]
*  Which is based upon immigration and the promise that trump made to have 15 million people [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6188.74s)]
*  Be deported from the country. I think in the first year i'm going to set the over under at five percent of that stated number [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6195.38s)]
*  Which is 750 000. So after one year in office [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6201.46s)]
*  will trump have [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6206.82s)]
*  Deported 750 000 less or more. That's my first prediction [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6209.92s)]
*  How are you gonna measure that you have to there has to be a like a source of truth on these things, right? [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6214.259999999999s)]
*  We'll do it based on the white house's reporting of deportations. Yeah, it's reasonable [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6218.82s)]
*  And we'll check with the polymarket team if there's a way to do that prediction market obviously [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6223.139999999999s)]
*  But I think that was the biggest issue of the election [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6227.299999999999s)]
*  So i'm putting it up there with just five percent in the first year. Yeah, it is interesting obama deported [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6229.0599999999995s)]
*  I think more than two million people [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6234.339999999999s)]
*  It's like people have forgotten but he was actually really really tough on the border. Yeah, chumat [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6236.339999999999s)]
*  Do you have a prediction market you want to put up the maggot representation on the smp 500 shrinks? [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6241.46s)]
*  Below [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6249.14s)]
*  30 percent. Oh, that's a good one. That's a good one [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6251.46s)]
*  So dispersion would happen to the other stocks. That's a good concentration. That's a good one [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6255.06s)]
*  So we'll finalize these you'll be able to go another one [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6259.78s)]
*  I wanted to kind of play with was microsoft aws and google cloud revenue growth. Who's going to win in growth in 2025? [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6263.62s)]
*  I don't know how closely you guys track but [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6271.06s)]
*  um [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6273.06s)]
*  I get a sense that google is kind of accelerating ahead gavin. I don't know how much you've yeah google. I mean google is [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6274.18s)]
*  I wouldn't say they're a lot smaller which makes it easier for them to grow faster [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6281.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6287.9400000000005s)]
*  Should we talk about [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6290.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I I guess um [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6292.5s)]
*  Who has the largest gain dollar? [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6294.9800000000005s)]
*  Dollar gain in revenue in cloud revenue in 2025 is it google amazon or microsoft? [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6297.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, it probably won't be google because if they had the largest dollar gain it would mean they were growing at an insane rates [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6304.9800000000005s)]
*  but I think [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6310.5s)]
*  Azure versus aws will be interesting [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6312.18s)]
*  Oh, I know the other one I want to do which was the national debt [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6315.86s)]
*  The national debt has grown about two trillion [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6319.3s)]
*  per year [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6322.26s)]
*  in each of the previous two [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6323.86s)]
*  Presidential [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6326.32s)]
*  Administrations, right? So over the last eight years, we've gone up over 16 trillion two trillion per year average [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6328.74s)]
*  so i'm going to set it at [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6333.46s)]
*  and [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6335.54s)]
*  Trump said he would not increase the national debt. I'll just set it at the national debt [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6337.299999999999s)]
*  Increases one trillion in the next year over under [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6342.0s)]
*  Is that a good prediction market or is it should be two trillion? [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6345.94s)]
*  Um, how would you do? Yeah, so what I would do is I would set the federal debt [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6348.82s)]
*  For december the u.s. Treasury market report on federal debt in 2025 [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6353.78s)]
*  And I would set it at 30 37 trillion [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6358.26s)]
*  And so you basically the u.s. Treasury [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6360.9800000000005s)]
*  market report 20 december 2025 [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6364.34s)]
*  Above or below 37 trillion. It's going to be above. I mean, let's just call it 38 trillion then [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6367.38s)]
*  Yeah, you want to basically in order to make this [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6372.58s)]
*  When you set a line dave it's got to be one where people take either side of it. It can't be everybody [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6375.78s)]
*  It takes it over. We'll do the u.s. Treasury market report december 2025 federal debt above 38 trillion or below 38 trillion [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6380.98s)]
*  Perfect, which would be how much added in the year about one and a half. Yeah [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6388.98s)]
*  I love that. I love that. That's a perfect one [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6393.139999999999s)]
*  We'll see if he can make any he can control the spending or if it'll just be the same [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6395.459999999999s)]
*  Gavin, what's your sense on federal debt next year? I think like most things it'll take like immigration. It'll take time to get going. Yeah [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6399.78s)]
*  It just it's going to take a little bit of time, but I think they will make progress [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6406.66s)]
*  By the way at some point [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6410.259999999999s)]
*  If i'm here on the all in again, I want to talk about ufos and the drones [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6412.5s)]
*  Let's talk about it now do it right now [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6418.259999999999s)]
*  Are you going full conspiracy theorist? Are you are you trying to get your seat here by being a little more alex jones? [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6420.0199999999995s)]
*  Do you believe those drones were aliens? What's going on? [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6425.94s)]
*  so I don't know and I think it's very clear if you look at all the um, you know statements from the new jersey mayors and [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6429.219999999999s)]
*  Governors, you know who've met with the police the FBI [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6435.44s)]
*  The defense department that they don't know now, you know, trump said someone in the government knows what they are [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6439.94s)]
*  He also said he was not going to go to bedminster anytime soon [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6446.9s)]
*  His resort there. I just think over the last [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6450.66s)]
*  I'd say eight years [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6454.099999999999s)]
*  Every 18 months. There's a big story in the new york times the washington posts the new yorker the atlantic very credible media sources [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6456.0199999999995s)]
*  With dozens of interviews with fighter pilots and commercial pilots [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6465.86s)]
*  Talking about seeing things with advanced sensors that made no sense to them [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6469.46s)]
*  Then there's kind of a taboo that went away [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6474.0199999999995s)]
*  There was an article in the new yorker where they quoted from a bunch of people who were at [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6478.259999999999s)]
*  You know kind of the the skunkworks laboratories in the 1950s and said they absolutely saw [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6485.7s)]
*  Extraterrestrial [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6490.82s)]
*  Materials that have been recovered from a crash. That's one reason the u.s. Made such big leaps in material science [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6492.82s)]
*  and [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6498.9s)]
*  You know, there was the umana thing where essentially a lot of you know, astronomers said hey, this is this is clearly [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6500.9s)]
*  a ufo of some sort [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6508.099999999999s)]
*  including the head of astronomy at harvard [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6510.5s)]
*  and then just the conspiracy theory I would have is if [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6513.46s)]
*  if if if [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6518.5s)]
*  if [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6520.82s)]
*  These are actually ufos and not you know [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6522.66s)]
*  Government drones either from the united states or china [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6526.82s)]
*  You know, it seems like the most likely explanation in new jersey is that some sort of a drill [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6530.82s)]
*  And obviously once this hysteria gets going people, um, you know misidentify commercial airplanes has drones [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6536.5s)]
*  And like why would ufos have blinking green and red lights? [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6545.139999999999s)]
*  But it's just interesting that there was you know a big concentration of these reports [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6548.820000000001s)]
*  As we were scaling into nuclear technology [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6555.14s)]
*  1945 to 1960 [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6557.84s)]
*  And then now that ai is getting going which is the next kind of technological phase shift for humanity [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6560.34s)]
*  There's another big [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6566.1s)]
*  I love this. This is great. You can come back come back next week [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6568.34s)]
*  You you won [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6572.9800000000005s)]
*  Congratulations. We have our winner for all in idle [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6574.5s)]
*  Gavin is now the fourth best. I love this kind of conspiracy [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6577.14s)]
*  But I mean, come on. I we how do we make a poly market at this free? [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6581.3s)]
*  Are there documents that you think trump will release about the past in in terms of ufos there must be just an entire [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6588.18s)]
*  Spectrum of stuff, but that could be subject to foya if we went after it. No [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6595.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it depends how deeply it's classified and [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6600.9s)]
*  You know, i'm sure if the government doesn't want to give it up, um, they won't give it up [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6604.5s)]
*  But you know, there's all the you know, there's all you think but look let's be honest you think that there are docs [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6610.0199999999995s)]
*  Like there there's documentation that the u.s. Government has that there are ufos [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6615.219999999999s)]
*  That there have been we just can't explain it [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6620.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and you know, they they call it uaps now to make it, you know not flying saucers [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6623.379999999999s)]
*  But it just feels like something fun what percentage chance you put on [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6628.82s)]
*  We have [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6633.46s)]
*  Actual knowledge on a percentage basis what percentage chance you put on the government u.s [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6634.66s)]
*  Government is sitting on knowledge of extra-terrestrial life percent at least 20 from tremoth. What do you say gavin? I would say [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6638.82s)]
*  25 I would take the over on the 20 [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6644.98s)]
*  Okay, great. So you think there's a non a significant small chance that this is the case freeberg sultan of science [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6647.46s)]
*  What chance do you think? [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6654.74s)]
*  There is this government sitting on some extra-terrestrial life or proof of it [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6656.66s)]
*  It's a longer conversation. I don't have time for this, but I I gotta be honest. I don't um, [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6662.02s)]
*  I don't generally align with the idea that like our very [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6665.860000000001s)]
*  narrow range of like [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6669.620000000001s)]
*  understanding of technology and biology kind of [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6672.88s)]
*  is [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6676.660000000001s)]
*  What visits us or would visit us? I think that there's [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6677.620000000001s)]
*  an extension of information gathering [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6681.780000000001s)]
*  That doesn't require moving physical biological life forms from one part of the galaxy to another [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6685.22s)]
*  So I think that the whole premise of like ufo's moving bodies around is rooted in the current state of technology of humanity [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6691.06s)]
*  Which is the basis of arthur clark's [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6699.3s)]
*  Treatment of 2001 a space odyssey not which was done before the screenplay which was done before the book [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6702.72s)]
*  And the treatment which you can buy [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6708.820000000001s)]
*  I think highlights this the best which is eventually every civilization reaches a sufficiently advanced level of technology [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6710.9800000000005s)]
*  that you no longer need to physically move the bodies of [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6717.3s)]
*  The the biological organisms around that you simply are gathering information [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6720.66s)]
*  And affecting information because once you have the ability to convert any molecule into any other molecule [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6725.38s)]
*  And you have access to sufficient energy which you will eventually evolve to be able to do [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6729.9400000000005s)]
*  You can basically turn your local part of the universe into anything you wanted to turn into [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6734.02s)]
*  And then you're simply gathering information from all over the rest of the universe. So I would argue [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6738.1s)]
*  That there doesn't really make a lot of basic sense in why alien bodies would want to move around the galaxy [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6743.22s)]
*  I'm just saying it right now if trump releases information [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6749.54s)]
*  On extraterrestrial life [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6754.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm voting for him to have a third term. I'm putting it out there. I'm going full maga [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6756.0199999999995s)]
*  He gets a third term for me. We're changing the constitution [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6760.18s)]
*  This has been another amazing episode of the all in one last question for gavin one cool. Oh one last for gavin. Okay [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6762.82s)]
*  Do you think? [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6768.0199999999995s)]
*  extraterrestrial life [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6769.5199999999995s)]
*  built the pyramids [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6770.9s)]
*  Is that the most plausible explanation to the [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6773.38s)]
*  Accuracy [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6776.4s)]
*  I don't know. It is it is so strange the way there are [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6777.78s)]
*  You know in so many I would say [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6782.66s)]
*  cultures all over the world pre [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6784.9s)]
*  You know, we are closer in time [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6788.259999999999s)]
*  To cleopatra than she was to the time of the great pyramids like it was a long time ago [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6791.86s)]
*  But it's just weird that in so many cultures all over the world. There are these depictions of what looked like astronauts [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6796.98s)]
*  And then there's all these renaissance era paintings that clearly show what we would call ufos in the skies [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6803.0s)]
*  over cities [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6811.96s)]
*  So, I don't know I just think it's on with you I love conspiracy gavin [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6815.56s)]
*  If you're jason if you're a questioning person these things create these weird unending, you know open [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&t=6824.04s)]
