*  Alright everybody the show has started the four of us are still here [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=137.68s)]
*  By some miracle we're still going after 107 episodes that it's better than ever last week. We're at number 12. So mainstream media [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=141.72s)]
*  We'll see you in the top 10 [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=148.76s)]
*  Here we go Twitter files part one and we're not to drive despite your oppressive conditions. Yes [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=151.8s)]
*  If I was getting five but paid five bucks for this I'd be on strike right now [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  Guys, not only you're getting five bucks. You're getting a bill for the production. Okay, here we go [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=167.8s)]
*  Beautiful is it that the same reporters who couldn't stop writing [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=172.62s)]
*  About the oppressive working conditions that Elon Musk was supposedly creating because he simply wanted the employees to go back to the office [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=177.34s)]
*  And work hard and if they didn't he'd give him a generous three months severance package [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=183.78s)]
*  Yeah, those same reporters are now on strike because the Solsburgers are running a clickbait farm over there with oppressive working conditions [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=188.22s)]
*  The intellectual dishonesty has never been higher in the world. Yeah [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=195.02s)]
*  I would like to actual honesty. Yes, will the publisher of the New York Times agree that anybody who isn't happy? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=198.5s)]
*  There can have a voluntary three months severance package [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=206.62s)]
*  Yeah [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=209.58s)]
*  Click this link and do you want to work hard or do you want three months severance if the New York Times publisher did that? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=209.9s)]
*  You know, it would happen [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=215.74s)]
*  800 of 1200 people would take the severance [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=217.1s)]
*  Of course. All right. Here we go Twitter files have dropped part one dropped with the legendary [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=219.82s)]
*  Award-winning [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=226.38s)]
*  Highly respected journalist Matt Taibbi if you don't know who he is. He is a left-leaning journalist who worked at [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=227.74s)]
*  Rolling Stone and did the best coverage hands down of the financial crisis and the shenanigans and he held truth to power to that group [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=234.70000000000002s)]
*  This is important to note [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=242.1s)]
*  The second drop was given to Barry Weiss who is a right-leaning [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=243.70000000000002s)]
*  Independent journalist. These are both independent journalists [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=249.70000000000002s)]
*  She previously worked at the New York Times itself now, I think we should work backwards [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=252.82s)]
*  From two to one. Do you agree? Yes for sure. Let's start with the drop that just happened last night [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=260.1s)]
*  Yes, so last night a drop happened. So [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=265.38s)]
*  Here's what happens in [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=268.18s)]
*  Twitter files part two. I'm gonna give a basic summary and then I'm gonna give it to sacks because he's chomping at the bit [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=270.1s)]
*  We now have confirmation that what the right thought was happening all along which is a secret [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=274.54s)]
*  Silencing system built into the software of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=281.34s)]
*  Blacklists was tagging right-wing conservative voices in the system and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=285.41999999999996s)]
*  These included people like Dan [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=291.61999999999995s)]
*  Bunge you know, is that he a pronounce it? Yes [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=294.85999999999996s)]
*  He was tagged with being on a search blacklist what that means is you're a fan of of Dan's who is a [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=296.94s)]
*  Former Secret Service agent who is now a right-wing conservative [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=304.14s)]
*  I could just say conservative instead of wing a conservative radio host podcast host [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=307.74s)]
*  He was not allowed to be found in search engines for some reason [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=312.98s)]
*  Charlie Kirk who is a conservative commentator? He was tagged with do not amplify [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=317.82s)]
*  I guess that means you can't trend into people's feeds even if they follow you and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=322.42s)]
*  then [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=327.58s)]
*  There were people who were banned from the trends blacklist including a Stanford professor J [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=328.94s)]
*  thought to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=335.78s)]
*  Charya, did I get it right? So yes, Jay about a char. Yeah, okay. I got it right doctor of Stanford School of Medicine and he was [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=337.53999999999996s)]
*  Not allowed on the trends blacklist because he had a dissenting opinion a Stanford [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=345.73999999999995s)]
*  Professor had a dissenting opinion on kovat [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=353.17999999999995s)]
*  That's turned out to be true and this is where the danger comes in because all of these actions were taken [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=355.42s)]
*  without any transparency and [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=362.1s)]
*  They were taken on one side of the aisle by people inside of Twitter [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=365.65999999999997s)]
*  essentially covertly no ownership of who did it and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=371.9s)]
*  They never told the people they gaslit them. They could see their own tweets [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=375.42s)]
*  They could use the service but they couldn't be seen even by their own fans in many cases here [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=382.21999999999997s)]
*  Sax when you look at that, let's just start with that first piece [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=389.09999999999997s)]
*  The shadow banning as it's called in our industry where you can participate in a community, but you can't be seen [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=392.78s)]
*  Are any is there any circumstance under which this tool would make sense for you to deploy and then what's your general take on? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=401.53999999999996s)]
*  What has been discovered last night? Okay, look [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=408.82s)]
*  Yes, let me start with what's been discovered here. Let me boil it down for you [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=412.41999999999996s)]
*  This is an FTX level fraud [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=416.53999999999996s)]
*  Except that what was stolen here was not customer funds [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=420.34s)]
*  It was their free speech rights not just the rights of people like Jay Bonatoria and Dan Bongino to speak [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=423.46s)]
*  But the right of the public to hear them in the way that they expected [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=429.14s)]
*  Okay, and you had statement after statement by Twitter executives like Jack Dorsey like [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=434.02s)]
*  Vijaya Gaudi like [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=440.7s)]
*  You know yo well and others saying we do not shadow ban and then they also said we certainly this is their emphasis [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=443.09999999999997s)]
*  Do not shadow ban on the basis of political viewpoint and what the Twitter files show is that is exactly what they were doing [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=450.46s)]
*  They in the same way that SPF was using [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=457.3s)]
*  FTX and customer funds as his personal piggy bank. They were using Twitter as their personal [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=461.06s)]
*  Ideological piggy bank they were going in to the tools and using the content moderation system [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=467.12s)]
*  These big brother like tools that were designed to basically put their thumb on the scale of American democracy and [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=472.2s)]
*  Suppress viewpoints that they did not agree with and they did not like even when even when they could not [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=478.68s)]
*  justify [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=485.68s)]
*  Removing content based on their own rules [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=486.92s)]
*  So there are conversations in the slack that Barry Weiss exposed where for example lives of tik-tok [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=489.15999999999997s)]
*  They admit in the slack that we can't suppress lives of tip talk based on our hate policy [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=494.88s)]
*  Lives of tik-tok hasn't violated it. We're gonna suppress that account anyway now. It's important to note what lives of tik-tok does [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=501.40000000000003s)]
*  This is a great talking point [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=507.64s)]
*  lives of tik-tok finds people who are trans [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=509.68s)]
*  people who are you know, maybe not LGBTQ and [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=514.24s)]
*  they feature their tik-toks and [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=519.28s)]
*  They mock them on Twitter now this certainly is free speech and [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=522.36s)]
*  The argument from the safety team was by putting all of these together [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=526.88s)]
*  You're inciting violence towards those people and they said they haven't broken a rule but collectively [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=531.4399999999999s)]
*  They could be in some way [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=537.84s)]
*  Targeting those people. Is there anything fair? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=541.0s)]
*  Friedberg to that statement [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=543.84s)]
*  That they targeted them by collecting their let's say views that are I'm asking this question for discussion purposes [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=546.84s)]
*  I'm not giving my take out. Hold on. I want free bird. Why can't I finish? I'm gonna go back to you spoke for two minutes [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=554.96s)]
*  That's why Friedberg you turned down moderating today sex [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=560.72s)]
*  You could everybody else is as long as they want I get interrupted. You got two minutes [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=563.9200000000001s)]
*  Let me just finish the SPF. Let me just finish the SPF analogy [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=568.36s)]
*  Okay, then you can both sides this is [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=571.44s)]
*  Don't worry, while you're speaking, he'll drop one or two words on you and then yeah [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=575.1600000000001s)]
*  Why did people like Adi and Yoel deny that they were engaged in shadow banning even though that's clearly what they were doing [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=578.44s)]
*  Because they knew that they had an obligation to be stewards of the public trust [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=584.9200000000001s)]
*  They were custodians of public trust [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=590.2800000000001s)]
*  They knew they were violating that trust the same way that SPF had a duty to be custodians of his customers funds [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=592.5200000000001s)]
*  They did not implement their own policy that they said they were implementing [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=601.48s)]
*  Why because they were suppressing accounts that personally offended them that personally they disagreed with and they wanted to deprive the public of the right to hear [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=605.48s)]
*  Okay [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=613.88s)]
*  So now the way that they're justifying this hold on the way that the media is today justifying it is they're pointing to [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=614.12s)]
*  Obscure provisions in the terms of use around spam accounts things like that saying oh well the terms of use showed that they had the right to do this [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=620.0400000000001s)]
*  This is like the margin account. Okay [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=627.96s)]
*  They did not have the right to use these tools in this way. Okay, jay balacharya was not posting spam [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=630.36s)]
*  Tell me where professor a standard professor professor. It doesn't yes [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=638.12s)]
*  You disagree with it has been proven correct completely. He was opposed to lockdowns [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=643.32s)]
*  That was the great barrington declaration and they suppressed it. What is the justification for that? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=647.96s)]
*  You have to answer my question then sax since you want to talk so much hold on [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=653.48s)]
*  Sax I want you to answer the question then since you are so interested in talking hold on [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=657.88s)]
*  I want him to answer one question [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=662.2800000000001s)]
*  Then it's going to you freeberg sax should lives of tik tok be able to collect [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=664.0400000000001s)]
*  uh trans people [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=669.88s)]
*  Living their life making tik toks put them into a group feed [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=671.96s)]
*  mock them [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=677.08s)]
*  and [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=678.84s)]
*  If those people experience [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=680.5200000000001s)]
*  Harassment because of it is that something that twitter should allow i'm asking you this without giving my opinion [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=683.24s)]
*  I'm curious your opinion specifically for the lives of tik tok since you open that door and you wanted to bring up [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=688.68s)]
*  That very thorny issue go [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=694.12s)]
*  Listen so on on lives of tik tok my understanding of that account is that they only take videos that have already been made public [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=696.1999999999999s)]
*  By another account. They're all public. They're all sort of they're all in the public domain and then they repost them [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=703.3199999999999s)]
*  Sometimes they make a snarky comment, but usually they just let them stand on their own [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=709.08s)]
*  That is not a violation of free speech now [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=713.0s)]
*  The way that I think these twitter executives have interpreted it is that they live in such a bubble [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=715.4s)]
*  And they live in with such privilege and entitlement that they think that when their point of view [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=722.2s)]
*  Gets criticized or challenged that that in and of itself is harassment. That's not that is public debate [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=728.12s)]
*  And they want to make themselves and their points of view immune to public debate and the way that they do that [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=734.5200000000001s)]
*  Is that they claim that any criticism is harassment. It's not [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=739.72s)]
*  If in aggregate final final follow-up if in aggregate those people report being harassed and they have evidence of being harassed [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=743.8000000000001s)]
*  What should twitter do? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=750.36s)]
*  Listen, if somebody is harassed i'm i'm fine with taking that down [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=751.5600000000001s)]
*  But being publicly criticized or simply retweeted is not harassment [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=755.4000000000001s)]
*  Okay, harassment needs to be targeted and it needs to be more than just public criticism or even a snarky comment here or there [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=760.28s)]
*  and so you don't consider a not, you know, a [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=767.56s)]
*  daily feed of trans people being [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=771.0799999999999s)]
*  Mocked you don't consider that target harassment. Got it. Don't listen to me about it [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=775.0799999999999s)]
*  Listen to twitter's own slack files about it [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=779.0799999999999s)]
*  They knew that the account that lives of tik tok was not violating the rules yet [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=782.5999999999999s)]
*  They suppressed that they suspended it six times. They knew they were on shaky ground. They wanted to do it [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=787.0s)]
*  Anyway, why because they because it's their people are experiencing harassment. That's why they did it [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=792.12s)]
*  But it is a thorny freedom of speech issue. I agree with you. I think uh, I think sax has [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=796.52s)]
*  Articulated a vision for the product he wanted twitter to be [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=804.9s)]
*  But I don't think that's necessarily the product that they wanted to create [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=810.1999999999999s)]
*  It's not that twitter set out at the time or stated clearly that they were going to be the harbinger of truth and the free speech [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=814.84s)]
*  Platform for all I think they were really clear [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=821.48s)]
*  and they have been in their behavior and as you know demonstrated through this stuff that came out which to me feels a lot like a [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=824.6800000000001s)]
*  We already knew all this stuff. This is a bit of a nothing burger that they were [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=831.6400000000001s)]
*  Curating and they were editing and they were editorializing [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=836.0200000000001s)]
*  Other people's content and the ranking of content in the same way that many other internet platforms do [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=840.3000000000001s)]
*  To create what they believe to be their best user experience for the users that they want to appeal to and i'll say like [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=847.02s)]
*  There's been this long debate [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=854.38s)]
*  And it goes back 20 years at this point on how google does ranking right? I mean you guys may remember jeremy stoppeman went to [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=856.62s)]
*  DC and he complained about how google was using his content and he wasn't being ranked high enough as google's own content that was being [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=863.5s)]
*  Shoved in the wrong place and there's a guy who ran kind of he was a spokesperson for the seo the search engine optimization [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=870.7s)]
*  rules [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=878.22s)]
*  At google and it was always the secret at google. How did the search results get ranked? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=879.82s)]
*  And I can tell you it's not just a pure algorithm that there was a lot of manual intervention a lot of manual work [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=884.62s)]
*  In fact the manual work gets to be to the point that they said there's so much stuff that we know [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=890.1400000000001s)]
*  Is a is the best content and the best form of content for the user experience? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=894.62s)]
*  That they ranked it all the way at the top and they called it the one box [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=899.4200000000001s)]
*  It's the stuff that sits above the primary search results and that editorialization ultimately led to a product [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=902.0600000000001s)]
*  That they intended to make because they believed it was a better user experience for the users that they wanted to service [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=908.22s)]
*  And I don't think that that this is any different than what's happened at twitter [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=913.9000000000001s)]
*  Twitter is not a government agency. They're not a free speech. They're not the internet [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=918.4599999999999s)]
*  They're a product and the product managers and the people that run that that product team [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=922.54s)]
*  Ultimately made some editorial decisions that said this is the content we do want to show and this is the content [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=927.66s)]
*  We don't want to show and they certainly did wrap up [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=932.62s)]
*  Um, you know a bunch of rules that had a lot of leeway for what they could or couldn't do [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=935.9s)]
*  Or they gave themselves a lot of different excuses on how to do it. I don't agree with it [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=940.3s)]
*  It's not the product I want it's not the product I think should exist [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=944.38s)]
*  I think elon also saw that and clearly he stepped in and said I want to make a product that is [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=947.82s)]
*  A different product than what is being created today [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=953.18s)]
*  So none of this feels to me like these guys were the guardians of the internet and they came along and they were distrustful [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=955.5s)]
*  They did exactly what they what a lot of other companies have done and exactly what they set out to do [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=961.82s)]
*  And they editorialized a product for a certain user group. And by the way, they never blocked they never edited people's tweets [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=966.7s)]
*  They changed how people's results were showing up in rankings [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=972.7s)]
*  They showed how viral they would get in the trend box. Those were in app features and in app services [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=975.74s)]
*  This was not about taking someone's tweet and changing it and people may feel ashamed and they may feel [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=981.58s)]
*  You know upset about the fact that they were deranked [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=987.82s)]
*  Or they were kind of quote shadow banned [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=991.9s)]
*  but ultimately [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=994.14s)]
*  That's the product they chose to make and people have the choice and the option of going elsewhere and I don't agree with it [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=995.58s)]
*  And it's not the product I want and it's not a product I want to use and I certainly don't feel happy seeing it [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1000.78s)]
*  But so you want to see products in you want free work to summarize it you want to see the free market do its job [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1005.42s)]
*  Chamath [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1011.5s)]
*  You worked at facebook facebook seems to have done I would say an excellent job with content moderation [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1012.54s)]
*  I think in large part correct me if i'm wrong because of the real names policy [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1018.62s)]
*  Uh, but you tell us what you think, you know when you look at this and the 15 year history of social media and moderation [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1022.62s)]
*  I think moderation is incredibly difficult and typically what happens is [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1030.08s)]
*  early on in a company's life cycle, and I i'm going to guess that [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1035.1999999999998s)]
*  twitter and youtube [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1039.4399999999998s)]
*  were very similar to what we did at facebook and it's very similar to probably what tik tok had to do in the early days, which is [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1041.36s)]
*  You have this massive tidal wave of usage [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1048.08s)]
*  And so you're always on a little bit of a hamster wheel [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1051.76s)]
*  And so you build these very basic tools and you uncover problems along the way [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1055.04s)]
*  and so I I think it's important to [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1060.8s)]
*  Humanize the people that are at twitter because i'm not sure that there are these super nefarious actors per se [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1064.62s)]
*  I do think that they were conflicted [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1070.3999999999999s)]
*  I do think that they made some very corrupting decisions, but I don't think that they were these evil actors [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1072.3999999999999s)]
*  Okay, I think that they were folks who? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1078.48s)]
*  against the tidal wave of usage [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1082.0s)]
*  built some brittle tools built on top of them built on top of it some more and tried to find a way of coping and as [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1084.16s)]
*  scale [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1090.88s)]
*  increased [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1092.32s)]
*  They didn't have an opportunity to take a step back and reset and I think that that's true for all of these companies [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1093.76s)]
*  And so you're just seeing it out in the light what's happening at twitter [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1098.96s)]
*  But don't for a second think that any other company behaved any differently google facebook twitter bite dance and tik tok [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1102.8s)]
*  They're all the same. They're all dealing with this problem and they're all probably trying to do [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1109.68s)]
*  A decent job of it as best as they know how so what do we do from here is the question? Okay? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1114.64s)]
*  The reason somebody needs to do something about this is summarized really elegantly in this jay batacharya tweet [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1120.64s)]
*  So please nick just throw it up here so that we can just talk about this [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1128.56s)]
*  This is why? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1133.12s)]
*  I think that this issue is important [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1134.64s)]
*  Critically, this is a perfect tweet still trying to process my emotions on learning that twitter blacklisted me [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1137.2s)]
*  Okay, who cares about that? Here's what matters the thought that will keep me up tonight [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1143.1999999999998s)]
*  censorship of scientific discussion [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1148.62s)]
*  permitted policies like school closures [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1151.52s)]
*  And a generation of children were hurt now just think about that in a nutshell [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1154.56s)]
*  What was jay batacharya to do? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1160.08s)]
*  Maybe he was supposed to go on tik tok and try to sound the alarm bells through a tik tok [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1162.2399999999998s)]
*  Maybe he was supposed to go on youtube and create a video. Maybe he was supposed to go on facebook [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1166.56s)]
*  And you know post into a facebook group or or do a newsfeed post [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1171.6s)]
*  The the problem is that and the odds are reasonably likely that a lot of these companies had very similar policies in this example [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1176.8s)]
*  around covid misinformation because it was the cdc [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1184.08s)]
*  And you know governmental organizations directing, you know [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1188.32s)]
*  information and rules [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1192.22s)]
*  Reaching out to all of these companies, right? So we're just seeing an insight into twitter, but the point is it happened everywhere [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1194.3999999999999s)]
*  The implication of suppressing information like this is that a credible individual like that [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1200.5600000000002s)]
*  Can't spark a public debate [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1206.72s)]
*  And in not being able to spark the debate [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1209.68s)]
*  You have this building up of errors in the system [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1213.1200000000001s)]
*  And then who gets hurt in this example, which is true. It's like you couldn't even talk about school closures and masking [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1217.52s)]
*  Up front and early in the system if you had scientists actually debate it [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1224.8000000000002s)]
*  Maybe what would have happened is we would have kept the schools open and you would have had less learning loss and you'd have less depression [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1229.8400000000001s)]
*  And less over prescription of you know, riddle in an adderall because those are all factual things we can measure today [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1235.04s)]
*  So I think the important thing to take away from all of this is we've got confirmatory evidence [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1241.2s)]
*  that [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1247.76s)]
*  Whether they're you know, these folks under a tidal wave of pressure [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1248.56s)]
*  Made some really bad decisions [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1252.56s)]
*  And the implications are pretty broad reaching [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1255.3600000000001s)]
*  And now I do think governments have to step in and create better guardrails. So this kind of stuff doesn't happen [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1258.64s)]
*  I don't buy the whole it's a you know, private company. They can do what they want. I think that that is [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1265.04s)]
*  Too naive of an expectation for how important these three companies literally are [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1271.44s)]
*  to how americans [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1278.0s)]
*  Consume and process information to make decisions incredibly well said sac your reaction to your besties [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1279.6s)]
*  I largely agree with what chamas said but let's go back to what freeberg sex [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1285.04s)]
*  I think what freeberg's point of view is is really what you're hearing now from the mainstream media today [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1288.16s)]
*  Which is oh nothing to see here [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1292.32s)]
*  You know that they told us all along what was happening. This was just content moderation [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1295.3600000000001s)]
*  They had the right to do this. You're making a big deal over nothing [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1300.4s)]
*  No, that's not true. Go back and look at the media coverage starting in 2018 [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1303.28s)]
*  Article after article said that this idea of shadow banning was a right-wing conspiracy theory. That's what they said [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1307.6000000000001s)]
*  Furthermore jack dorsey denied that shadow banning was happening including at a congressional hearing I believe under oath [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1314.4s)]
*  So either he lied or he was lied to by his subordinates. I actually believe that the latter is possible [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1321.44s)]
*  I think I don't think it's true with sbf. It might be true with jack because he was so checked out [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1327.6s)]
*  Furthermore you had people again like vijay agadi [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1331.9s)]
*  Again tweeting and repeatedly stating we do not shadow ban and we certainly don't shadow ban on the basis of political viewpoints [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1335.28s)]
*  So these people were denying exactly [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1342.16s)]
*  What their critics were saying they were accusing their critics of being conspiracy theorists now that the thing is proven [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1345.44s)]
*  The mountain of evidence has dropped they're saying oh, well, this is old news. This was known a long time ago [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1352.16s)]
*  No, it was not known a long time ago. It was disputed by you [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1357.1200000000001s)]
*  And now finally it's proven and you're trying to say it's not a big deal. It is a big deal [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1361.0400000000002s)]
*  It's a violation of the public trust and if you are so proud of your content moderation policies [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1365.8400000000001s)]
*  Why didn't you admit what you were doing in the first place? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1371.9199999999998s)]
*  That's why don't you feel good that elon's running this business now [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1375.52s)]
*  I mean like the things that you're concerned about as a user [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1378.8s)]
*  as someone who cares about [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1382.48s)]
*  the public's access [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1384.8s)]
*  to knowledge [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1386.56s)]
*  To opinions to free speech [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1387.76s)]
*  This has got to be a good change right like this has come to light. It's clearly going to get resolved [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1390.32s)]
*  Everyone's going to move forward [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1394.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean do you think that there's penalties needed for the people that work there or like what what's the anger? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1395.84s)]
*  Because no one like I think I look I think we got I think we basically got extremely lucky [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1400.8799999999999s)]
*  Yep [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1406.3999999999999s)]
*  That elon must happen to care about free speech and decided to do something about it and actually had the means to do something about it [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1406.6399999999999s)]
*  He's just about the only [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1413.36s)]
*  Billionaire who has that level of means who actually cared enough to take on this battle [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1415.12s)]
*  But are you saying that this is I think you deserve praise for that? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1420.48s)]
*  but [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1424.96s)]
*  I mean unless elon can buy every single tech company, which he clearly can't [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1426.3999999999999s)]
*  I think you guys are right. This is happening a lot of other tech companies [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1430.56s)]
*  We're about to rewrite the government the united states government is going to make an attempt [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1433.36s)]
*  To rewrite section 230 [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1438.08s)]
*  I think that what this does is put a very fine point [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1440.32s)]
*  On a comment that elon actually tweeted out and nick if you could find that please that's a very good tweet where he said going forward [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1443.6s)]
*  You will be able to see if you were shadow banned you were able to see if you were deboosted [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1450.24s)]
*  Why and be able to appeal and I think that that concept [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1456.48s)]
*  To be very honest with you should be enshrined in law [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1460.96s)]
*  And I think that should be part of the section 230 rewrite [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1464.4s)]
*  And all of these media companies and all of these social media companies should be subject to it [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1468.4s)]
*  And the reason is because it ties a lot of these concepts together and says look [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1474.4s)]
*  You can build a service. You're a private company make as much money as you want [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1479.44s)]
*  But we're going to have some connective tissue back to the fundamental underpinnings of the constitution [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1483.8400000000001s)]
*  Which is the framework under which we all live and we're going to transparently allow you to understand it [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1489.92s)]
*  And I think that's really reasonable make that a legal expectation of all these organizations [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1494.72s)]
*  And by the way, and by the way, sorry the companies the companies will love it because I think it's super hard for you [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1499.8400000000001s)]
*  To be in these companies and they probably are like take this responsibility off my plate. It's just very simple [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1505.76s)]
*  This is a there's really four problems that occurred here number one [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1511.1200000000001s)]
*  There was no transparency [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1515.2s)]
*  The people who were shadow banned taken out of search, etc [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1517.6000000000001s)]
*  They did not know if they were told and it was clear to users [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1522.4s)]
*  We could have a discussion about was that a fair judgment or not in the cases we've seen so far from barry weiss's reporting in the twitter files part [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1527.28s)]
*  It's very clear that these were not justifiable number two [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1536.0s)]
*  These were not evenly enforced. It's very clear that one side [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1540.48s)]
*  We because we don't have one example [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1545.28s)]
*  of a person on the left [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1547.76s)]
*  Being censored when we if we do then we could put [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1550.16s)]
*  Balls and strikes together and we could say how many people on one side versus how many people on the other? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1553.92s)]
*  It's pretty clear what happened here because these all occurred with a group of people working at twitter [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1557.52s)]
*  Which is 96 or 90 per 7 percent left leaning the statistics are clear [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1563.84s)]
*  number three [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1569.6s)]
*  The shadow banning and the search banning and I think this is something we talked about previously chamath [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1571.04s)]
*  It feels very underhanded. This was your point [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1576.24s)]
*  If we're going to block people they should be blocked [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1578.96s)]
*  And they should know why? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1582.24s)]
*  The fourth piece of this which is absolutely infuriating and this is a discussion that myself sax and chum and um, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1584.16s)]
*  Elon have had many times about this moderation [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1590.96s)]
*  I'm not speaking out of school now because he's now very public with his position [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1593.92s)]
*  And you know his position he came to on his own it's it's not like [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1597.68s)]
*  This is sax and I you know coming up these positions. This is why elon bought the business [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1601.76s)]
*  If you really want to intellectually, uh test your thinking on this and i'm a moderate who's left-leaning [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1607.12s)]
*  I can tell you there's a simple way for anybody who is debating the validity of the concerns here [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1614.32s)]
*  Imagine rachel matto or ezra klein or whoever your favorite left-leaning pundit is [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1621.28s)]
*  Was shadow banned by a group of right-wing moderators who were acting covertly and without any transparency [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1626.72s)]
*  How would you feel if matto reporting on? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1634.8s)]
*  you know, uh all the russian [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1638.48s)]
*  Coordination with trump's campaign did this or ezra klein with whatever topics he covers and you will very quickly find yourself infuriated [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1641.98s)]
*  And you should then intellectually as we say on this program steel manning [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1651.06s)]
*  If you argue the other side, it's infuriating for either side to experience this and that is what the 230 change needs to be [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1655.2199999999998s)]
*  Chamath, you're exactly correct [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1661.62s)]
*  If you make a an action it should be listed on the person's profile page and on the tweet [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1664.1s)]
*  And if you click on the question mark, you should see when the action was taken [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1669.3s)]
*  By who? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1673.3s)]
*  You know which department maybe maybe not the person so they they get personally attacked [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1674.4199999999998s)]
*  And then what the resolution to it is this has been banned because it's targeted harassment [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1678.34s)]
*  This can be resolved in this way then everybody's behavior would steer [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1683.22s)]
*  Towards whatever the stated purpose of that social network is you can get better behavior by making the rules [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1687.54s)]
*  Clear by making the rules unclear and making it unfair you create this insane situation [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1695.2s)]
*  Go ahead chamath [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1701.86s)]
*  And that's why i'm infuriated about it. I think you have to take it one step further to really [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1703.3s)]
*  Do justice to why this should be important to everybody and I do think this school example it really matters to me like [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1707.94s)]
*  We have like I don't know now. We know what the counterfactual is which which is that we have [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1715.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean, we've relegated our children to a bunch of years [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1721.3s)]
*  Of really complicated relearning and learning that they never had to go through because of all the learning laws they gave them [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1725.06s)]
*  but [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1731.22s)]
*  What if jay batacharya who's I mean like you can't be you know [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1732.34s)]
*  Have a higher sort of role in society in terms of you know population credentials [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1736.42s)]
*  I mean imagine if if you know there was a platform where he could have actually said this and that you know people would have [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1741.46s)]
*  clamored and said you know what you and fauci need to get to the bottom of this or where [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1746.8200000000002s)]
*  Legislators could have seen it and said you know what before we make a decision like this [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1751.44s)]
*  Maybe hey fauci go talk to jay because he's a stanford prof. He's probably not an idiot [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1756.66s)]
*  Why does he think that or maybe let's convene, you know an actual group of 20 or 30 scientists [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1761.14s)]
*  and the fact that this one [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1767.6200000000001s)]
*  Version of thinking about things was deemed so heterodoxical. It is just such a good example [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1769.8600000000001s)]
*  They shut down an important conversation, you know that the decision was so wrong [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1775.22s)]
*  And the damage was so severe. Yes, so we know what happened by suppressing that speech and that's one example [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1780.5s)]
*  Well, it's in in my in my estimation [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1787.0600000000002s)]
*  It is the silver bullet example that cleans through all of this other stuff because you know [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1789.14s)]
*  I don't really care if rachel matto as reclined who the hell cares [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1793.14s)]
*  This is important stuff because it affects everybody irrespective of your political persuasion and what editorial you want to read? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1796.42s)]
*  Chamath, what if the investigation into the catholic church and the abuses that occurred there? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1801.8600000000001s)]
*  So we said oh this person it needs to be shut down [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1807.5400000000002s)]
*  And then children are molested for another decade by the way [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1810.74s)]
*  We have an example of that chanid o'connor came out on snl [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1813.3s)]
*  You can look it up for if you're under 40 years old and said fight the real enemy [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1816.58s)]
*  She ripped up a picture of the pope because of the scandals there. She was ex-communicated [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1819.86s)]
*  She was canceled at that time one of the first people to be canceled because she spoke truth to power [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1824.26s)]
*  What if somebody an investigative journalist at the new york times the boston globes are in the movie spotlight [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1828.6599999999999s)]
*  Those are the people who broke the story of the catholic church [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1833.86s)]
*  If somebody came in and the catholic church put pressure on a social network said hey [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1836.58s)]
*  You can't put this stuff up here. You can't have this discussion of here's here's another example [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1839.78s)]
*  It's infuriating. Why are we shutting down discussions in america? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1844.42s)]
*  The vietnam papers because because jacob the media the media does not value transparency anymore [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1846.74s)]
*  If you go back and look at the way the media portrays itself like in the movie the post which is about the revelations about the [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1851.7s)]
*  Catholic church where you go back to all the president's men what the media [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1858.66s)]
*  Is [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1862.02s)]
*  Prized and what they congratulate themselves on was first of all [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1863.14s)]
*  Transparency and exposing the lives of powerful people [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1868.24s)]
*  Well, that is exactly what has happened here the lies of the powerful group of people who were running twitter policy [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1870.98s)]
*  And suppressing one side of the debate [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1878.18s)]
*  Has been exposed and the media is treating it with a yawn like there's nothing to see here [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1881.3s)]
*  Why because they were complicit in this they were complicit? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1885.54s)]
*  In suppressing the views of people like jay baracharya [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1889.06s)]
*  They were complicit in choosing the views of falchi and the elite on covet and so they have no interest now in bringing [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1891.94s)]
*  Just only in making in making what's happened here at twitter fully transparent. I have to own it [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1899.86s)]
*  I think by the way, just so just a quick correction there. I think sax when you said the post [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1904.42s)]
*  Washington post watergate spotlight exactly. I'm not even thinking about spotlight. Sorry. It was may have been [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1908.26s)]
*  Okay, yeah, but like but the post is another example that that movie was about another [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1913.94s)]
*  Event like this which could have been easily suppressed in today's world much harder there, which was the pentagon papers [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1918.26s)]
*  And in that world, you know, there was an immense amount of pressure that the government put on the washington post [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1924.34s)]
*  But then they said you know what we're going with it and they still published it [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1930.18s)]
*  And it created a groundswell of support to really reexamine the vietnam war and it had a huge impact [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1933.3s)]
*  But could you imagine this time around which is like hey guys, there's going to be some kind of misinformation [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1938.26s)]
*  You know, these pentagon papers are not real. It's it's coming from the russians suppress it [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1942.58s)]
*  And nobody could leave it's so much easier now to run this play what journalists need to realize [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1947.1399999999999s)]
*  Is that today's conspiracy theories are tomorrow's Pulitzer prizes? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1953.3s)]
*  On to you sax not in the current media environment. They work for these corporations and they don't get rewarded for [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1957.9399999999998s)]
*  Telling the truth. Oh, no, they they're going for Pulitzers. Trust me. They are [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1964.5s)]
*  But what they need to do is stop thinking short term and think long term anytime. There's a conspiracy theory. You must give it [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1968.74s)]
*  Some validity and say is there any truth here? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1975.62s)]
*  Because it could in fact be a scandal that's being covered up [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1979.06s)]
*  And if you take the approach of shutting down everyone they're involved in the cover-up right now [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1982.34s)]
*  This is a cover-up. I agree. I'm in agreement with you [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1986.8999999999999s)]
*  Let's bring the first batch of twitter files into the conversation the one that matt taibbi exposed [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1989.78s)]
*  What he did was confirm that a completely true story by the new york post about hunter biden that came out a month before the election [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=1995.3s)]
*  Was suppressed by twitter executives including at the behest of you know of of fbi [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2002.1799999999998s)]
*  agents and [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2008.8999999999999s)]
*  Former security state officials. So this has now been exposed. There was no legitimate basis for suppressing that story [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2010.4199999999998s)]
*  It was true. It was a respective publication. They did it anyway. This is election interference [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2018.1s)]
*  You know the same people who pride themselves on strengthening democracy [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2023.62s)]
*  Are engaged in this wide-scale censorship of one side of the political debate [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2029.0s)]
*  Including of true stories before an election and then they puff out their chest and say we're protecting democracy [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2033.8799999999999s)]
*  They're not protecting democracy. They're interfering with democracy. They're interfering with the public's right to know [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2039.24s)]
*  And then we look at a country like china and we say well [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2045.08s)]
*  We're so much better than them because they've got this problem over there where the state [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2047.3999999999999s)]
*  And big tech are colluding to create a big brother like system. Well, what is this? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2051.96s)]
*  What are these tools that have been exposed? This is a big brother like system [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2057.24s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, but just you have to I know you want to make it like an equivalency [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2061.64s)]
*  It's less than a one percent equivalency because in our society we can have moments like this and we can have investigations [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2065.8799999999997s)]
*  So just to put it in perspective. Yeah, I don't look at jake. I don't think we're equivalent [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2071.72s)]
*  But what i'm saying is that this is very much like a big brother social credit system. Yes [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2075.3999999999996s)]
*  Alarm bells should be going off [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2082.12s)]
*  This should be an alarm and if elon didn't decide [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2084.7599999999998s)]
*  Just we had this one [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2088.04s)]
*  Idiot syncretic billionaire who believes in free speech if he didn't decide to take this on we would never have known this stuff [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2089.72s)]
*  Okay. Tell me what happened in between these two things. There is an attorney [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2095.88s)]
*  at [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2100.3599999999997s)]
*  Uh twitter and I don't know the details of this. Uh, right. Okay [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2101.56s)]
*  I do not work for the twitter corporation [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2105.4s)]
*  I do not speak for the twitter corporation sax does not work for the twitter corporation and does not speak for it [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2106.92s)]
*  But there was in between these two drops something that happened [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2111.0s)]
*  Yes [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2114.52s)]
*  So basically what was discovered and this is all just publicly reported is that a former fbi lawyer named jim baker [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2115.0s)]
*  Had now become deputy general counsel [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2122.3599999999997s)]
*  at twitter [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2125.72s)]
*  And this guy jim baker is like the zealot of the whole russian collusion hoax. He was involved [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2127.16s)]
*  in the um in the fisa warrants that were that the fbi applied to the fisa courts that had all the errors and emissions [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2132.52s)]
*  He was involved in the alphabank hoax. He was the guy that that perkins [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2140.28s)]

*  uh the phony scam to [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2149.48s)]
*  And he I don't think he was officially sanctioned. But basically he was asked to leave the fbi [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2151.8s)]
*  And then lo and behold [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2157.32s)]
*  Where does he land at twitter? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2159.0800000000004s)]
*  And he is involved in their content moderation policies. I think what it shows is how deeply intertwined [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2162.2000000000003s)]
*  The our big tech companies have become with the security state [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2168.62s)]
*  now how did this get exposed well [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2173.02s)]

*  putting forward [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2178.2999999999997s)]
*  Document requests for this for the latest batch of twitter files and she wasn't getting anything back [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2179.74s)]
*  And she's like what's going on here? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2185.42s)]
*  And the guy who's giving her the files is his name is jim [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2187.3399999999997s)]
*  And she's like, well wait like wait jim jim who and she finds out wait jim baker. Wait that jim baker [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2190.7s)]

*  and [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2200.38s)]
*  So it was discovered that the guy who was curating the twitter files [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2201.34s)]
*  Was this former operative of the fbi who was involved in the russian collusion hoax and then was involved in their [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2206.54s)]
*  Their blacklist decisions [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2215.2599999999998s)]
*  So in any event once this came out [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2217.66s)]
*  Twitter fired him [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2221.18s)]
*  and then you know [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2222.94s)]
*  Barry apparently received all these files that are now the the second batch of the twitter files and just to be clear [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2224.94s)]
*  that's not james baker if you're you know thinking it's the [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2230.2200000000003s)]
*  Former reagan cabinet member not james baker [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2234.62s)]
*  This is jim baker who's a different person right? But a lot of people are wondering well, how could this have been missed? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2238.38s)]
*  Listen, he's an fbi ex-fbi. These guys don't want to be found. I mean they they this is some people call it [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2243.18s)]
*  You know the permanent washington establishment some people call it the deep state the administration's come and go [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2249.58s)]
*  The people who work in washington stay there forever and they can simply effectuate policy by outlasting everybody else [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2255.1s)]
*  And clandestinely implementing what they believe and they've become a constituency of their own that exercises power [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2261.9s)]
*  Like a praetorian guard in washington. So in any event, this guy is an expert at bowl weeviling himself into the bureaucracy [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2269.34s)]
*  great [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2277.34s)]
*  Praetorian guard bully you're on fire. Hold on a second [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2278.52s)]
*  So hold on so when they finally hold on a second when they finally rooted when they finally rooted [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2282.06s)]
*  This this mole out of the fbi he bull weevils himself into another powerful bureaucracy. What is that word twitter evil? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2287.98s)]
*  bull weevil [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2295.58s)]
*  like borrows [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2297.1s)]
*  Like borrows like that so [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2301.02s)]
*  He digs his way into the twitter bureaucracy to the point where he isn't even found and then somehow [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2306.06s)]
*  He has put himself in the position [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2311.6600000000003s)]
*  To be intermediating the twitter files. Can you believe this? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2313.98s)]
*  So once it was discovered a unit of the imperial roman army that served as personal body guards and intelligence agents the praetorian guard [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2319.1800000000003s)]
*  Okay, got it. Well, you understand what happened is is that the praetorian guard originated because they were to defend the life of the emperor [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2326.7000000000003s)]
*  and then what happened [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2332.86s)]
*  that then they became so powerful that [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2334.7000000000003s)]
*  That whoever bribed the praetorians would become emperor and then finally the last step is that the praetorians themselves would pick the emperor [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2337.82s)]
*  And whoever basically led the praetorian guard would be the next emperor [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2345.42s)]
*  In any event, I mean we're not we're not at that point yet [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2349.6600000000003s)]
*  But the point is look the point is that these security state officials have power that they should not have [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2352.6200000000003s)]
*  Okay, that's the bottom line. They should not be [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2359.6600000000003s)]
*  Involved in our elections in this way, they should be completely [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2362.8599999999997s)]
*  Non-partisan and non-political they should just do their jobs as law enforcement officials [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2367.64s)]
*  But we know from the hunter biden story that a very important piece of this [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2372.3799999999997s)]
*  Was the pre-bunking that the fbi went to facebook and twitter and social networks and said be on the lookout [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2376.94s)]
*  For a story about hunter biden it is russian disinformation [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2383.5s)]
*  And they primed these social networks to suppress that story when it came out [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2387.28s)]
*  That was something they never should have done and they knew they knew the story was not fake [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2391.28s)]
*  They knew it was not russian disinformation because they had the laptop in their possession since 2019 [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2395.28s)]
*  Well, okay that has not the the providence of the um laptop is still being reviewed in fairness and there's [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2399.92s)]
*  Hold on you're wrong and there is an investigation going on of hunter biden [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2405.92s)]
*  You also have to put the context in here and please let me finish [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2409.2s)]
*  There is a context here of there was massive election [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2412.96s)]
*  Interference going on both sides of the aisle republicans democrats all wanted to see the russian interference and the ukrainian interference [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2415.84s)]
*  And trump's encouraging the ukraine and the republicans the russians to interfere in elections [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2424.1600000000003s)]
*  Everybody was on high alert and that happened to drop [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2429.52s)]
*  Uh, like it was announced 30 days before and it dropped 10 days before the election [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2432.8s)]
*  So everybody was on high alert and I agree. It was not done properly. Hold on. That's why it was the perfect [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2436.0s)]
*  Issues and done. It should have been done properly [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2440.8s)]
*  They should have said they should have come out public and say we don't know the providence of this [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2444.2400000000002s)]
*  It could be hacked. It might not be hacked jason. I know [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2448.48s)]
*  Let's wait and see we have to reserve judgment. No, listen, let me tell you what happened [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2452.4s)]
*  Let me just tell you what happened. Okay, so they make sure you source this I will so [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2455.52s)]
*  Look, it's all in the new york post. Okay, they've done. Oh great. No it nobody has refuted it. Nobody has refuted it [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2461.1200000000003s)]
*  It's a super partisan paper. No, let me just get let me just get this on the record here [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2467.04s)]
*  so from the post [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2471.36s)]
*  The fbi was given the laptop in 2019 by the lap store [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2473.04s)]
*  Store owner those guys have forensics. They have cyber experts. They knew the laptop was real [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2477.36s)]
*  We know it's real now. Nobody questions that in fact the fbi has admitted that the laptop was real and that the the hunter buying files [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2482.8s)]
*  Are real nobody disputes that okay [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2489.6s)]
*  But what they did before the election is they used this excuse [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2491.92s)]
*  Of russian disinformation to discredit the story before it even came out [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2495.6000000000004s)]
*  But they had no business getting involved in the story that way. They simply didn't they should have stayed out of it completely [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2499.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't I don't understand how you can possibly justify that [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2505.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think we do have to look at the context of that time period when hillary's emails were hacked and we had a [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2508.1600000000003s)]
*  Perfect excuse. Well, I didn't finish the sentence and we had a president [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2514.1600000000003s)]
*  Which you will agree our presidents and presidential candidates should not be encouraging foreign powers to hack their [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2518.08s)]
*  Uh their adversaries you agree with that. This is the only with that answer my question. Do you agree that presidential president? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2523.84s)]
*  Answer the question. Why do you have to do? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2531.44s)]
*  Personally attack me. No, I'm not attack me. Just answer the question should this is your election denial of for 2016 [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2534.0s)]
*  You're still wrapped up on this. You can't let it again. You personally attack me. You don't answer the question. That's fine. We'll move on [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2539.36s)]
*  You can't be intellectually honest. The audience knows you're not being intellectually honest [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2544.24s)]
*  You don't even know what you're talking about if you could answer the simple question should [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2548.24s)]
*  Presidents encourage foreign powers to hack their adversaries. Then you would be being intellectually dishonest. I am absolutely [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2552.38s)]
*  Disappointed that you will not answer that simple question. It's an obvious. Yes [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2559.3399999999997s)]
*  It's an obvious yes, we don't want people doing it. Of course, but I don't really believe that happened [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2563.12s)]
*  I don't really believe that happened, you know, trump's gonna win the primary. Let's keep going [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2567.04s)]
*  Uh china honestly, I don't know listen, I I don't I've said so many times in the show that he's not my candidate [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2571.76s)]

*  What you're doing right now is like delusional you're going back to some throwaway comment. He made it a rally in 2016 [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2582.32s)]
*  It's got nothing [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2587.68s)]
*  Absolutely nothing to do with this story and the fact you're even bringing it up is like pure tds [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2589.04s)]
*  And I don't know what ways i'm talking about it now instead of answering a question. That's your technique [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2593.76s)]
*  Is to call me names instead of answering the question i'm muddy the waters [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2599.44s)]
*  I want to make one more point about this hunter biden thing another technique that i'm muddy in the water [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2603.52s)]
*  So i'm not muddy in the water. You are I don't know what this has to do. Let's move on [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2606.64s)]
*  Let's move on. I want to make one final point. Okay, i'll make a final point [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2610.08s)]
*  There was a letter listen, there was a letter with this hunter biden thing [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2613.3599999999997s)]
*  This is 2020 election adjacent. We're not going back two elections ago. I want to talk about the most recent one [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2617.2799999999997s)]
*  Okay, fine. You had clapper you had comey at 50 of these security state officials [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2622.4s)]
*  They write a letter saying that the hunter biden story has all the uh hallmarks of russian disinformation [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2626.8s)]
*  They claimed that it was russian disinformation when it wasn't they knew it wasn't [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2633.2000000000003s)]
*  And it was the same story that the fbi was telling twitter [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2637.44s)]
*  And it was the same story that these twitter executives were indulging it even though they all knew or had reason to know [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2641.6000000000004s)]
*  It wasn't true [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2646.96s)]
*  And they suppressed the new york post story. Anyway, I don't know why you're bringing up this trump stuff [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2648.8s)]
*  It has nothing to do with the real issue here the real hold on a second the real issue is this [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2653.84s)]
*  Does social media have the right to suppress? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2658.8s)]
*  True stories put out by our media before the month before an election. Yes or no [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2661.68s)]
*  I'll I'll defend that I will answer your question. Yes or no, and you will not answer mine because you're being intellectually dishonest [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2668.16s)]
*  Yes [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2673.92s)]
*  We should know we should not suppress new stories if it was and I will argue both sides if it was snowed in [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2674.48s)]
*  If it was the pentagon papers if it's hunter biden's laptop taking out the sex stuff, which we both agree on [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2680.4s)]
*  or if it is uh, russia and uh ukraine where your presidential candidate at the time [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2686.88s)]
*  trump [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2694.4s)]
*  asked [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2695.52s)]
*  Zelensky to find dirt on biden before the election and he asked the russians to hack hillary's email and they did that and they [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2696.64s)]
*  Released it 10 days before the election. That is facts that happened and that is [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2703.44s)]
*  That's not what this was [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2707.68s)]
*  You said you would let me speak [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2709.9199999999996s)]

*  I will say my part you said yours and then we will move on [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2716.48s)]
*  the fact is [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2720.56s)]
*  trump [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2722.72s)]
*  Encouraged hacking of other candidates and he did it twice in a four-year period back-to-back elections [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2723.74s)]
*  We need to be on high alert when you have a republican candidate trump doing something so [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2730.3199999999997s)]
*  absolutely [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2737.02s)]
*  Treasonous [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2739.82s)]
*  This is why it's a perfect cover story. This is why it was the perfect cover story is because [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2741.04s)]
*  But you would address the treasonous behavior. Let's move on. I I don't think it was a perfect phone call [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2745.36s)]
*  I think it was there were lots of shenanigans. There were lots of shenanigans. Okay, i'm not defending hold on [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2750.48s)]
*  I'm not defending anything trump did. Okay, I don't feel the need. Okay, I never defended it [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2755.52s)]
*  But here but the deal is that you're letting your tds. I don't justify [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2760.08s)]
*  Come on you're letting you're you're allowing this russian disinformation to be a cover story [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2765.6s)]
*  No, I said I don't think post should have been blocked [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2771.04s)]
*  Your your your misguided. Why are you even bringing this up? It was not russian [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2773.92s)]
*  Under which the the reason i'm bringing it. I agree that the context made it a great cover story [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2778.32s)]
*  That's your interpretation. The the context also is everybody was on high alert [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2784.0s)]
*  Waiting for a hack to drop and in fact a hack dropped 10 days before you have [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2788.8s)]
*  Those not a hack [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2792.4s)]
*  Okay, we found out subsequently was a hack [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2793.84s)]
*  That's why they're here to be time. They knew at the point twitter and facebook did not know twitter and facebook didn't know [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2796.2400000000002s)]
*  That's the point. They don't know [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2802.32s)]
*  No, no, no, no taye be in that you you go back to the twitter files the first drop [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2804.96s)]
*  Jim baker hold on a second. Jim baker and vajay gaudi said [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2809.76s)]
*  Okay, that there were a lot of internal questions about whether [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2813.84s)]
*  That that hunter buying story could be justified under the hacked [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2818.32s)]
*  Yeah policy, okay [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2821.36s)]
*  and [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2823.2000000000003s)]
*  There were many legitimate questions raised internally about whether they could maintain that party line [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2824.0s)]
*  And the emerging view is that they could no longer maintain that line and still gaudi and jim baker said no [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2829.92s)]
*  We will maintain the idea that this was hacked information [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2835.52s)]
*  until proven otherwise [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2838.6400000000003s)]
*  Even though it was not hacked. It was a new york post story [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2840.48s)]
*  Okay, let's move on agree to disagree. Let's move on. Why are you bringing up all this like irrelevant stuff? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2842.96s)]
*  The audience and the other besties want us to move on so let's move on china ends most zero [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2848.3199999999997s)]
*  Covid rules and iran might be abolishing its morality police news broke [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2852.16s)]
*  In the past week on wednesday china's health the thoris overhauled its zero [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2857.44s)]
*  Covid policy and announced a 10-point national plan that scrapped most health code tracking and [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2860.7999999999997s)]
*  Also, they're rolling back their mass testing and this allowed many [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2867.44s)]
*  Positive cases to just simply quarantine at home like we were doing [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2871.2799999999997s)]
*  I guess a year ago now and uh, they're limiting some of these uh lockdowns [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2875.04s)]
*  This all comes from a foxconn letter [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2881.1200000000003s)]
*  which [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2884.0s)]
*  We don't know the cause causation here does does it does it well, we don't know [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2885.2000000000003s)]
*  That's why I just said we don't know cause and correlation here. Give give us some perspective here. Chema [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2889.52s)]
*  well [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2894.48s)]
*  I just think it's kind of ridiculous to assume that [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2896.0800000000004s)]
*  the second largest economy in the world [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2899.76s)]
*  pivots [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2902.56s)]
*  Based on one letter from one ceo. So I know that that's how the western describe the letter, please [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2903.92s)]
*  Yeah, well apparently what happened was terry guo [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2909.04s)]
*  Who's colloquially known as uncle terry who's the ceo of foxconn? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2912.56s)]
*  Wrote a letter that essentially said, you know, if we don't figure out a way to get out of these pandas this this lockdown process [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2915.92s)]
*  We're going to lose. Um, you know our leadership in the global supply chain [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2922.16s)]
*  And apparently that jolted the central planning commission to realize that they needed to [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2927.52s)]
*  You know get out of these lockdowns. I think it's something different which is I think this has been part and parcel [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2932.48s)]
*  of a very focused and dedicated [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2938.48s)]
*  plan [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2941.36s)]
*  by g [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2942.56s)]
*  Phase one was to consolidate power phase two was to get through november [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2943.84s)]
*  And to basically get reappointed for life and dispel any other [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2949.44s)]
*  You know rivals that he actually had [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2954.32s)]
*  And now phase three is just to reopen the economy again so this guy can basically sit on top of [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2957.44s)]
*  The second largest economy in the world, so I think this is sort of a natural uh flow of things [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2964.0s)]
*  The other part of it, which I think is being under reported [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2970.08s)]
*  Is [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2973.12s)]
*  I think that the way in which they did it was less responsive in my opinion to a letter from uncle terry [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2974.16s)]
*  But was more responsive to the fact that there are people on the ground and I think that these guys are getting [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2979.76s)]
*  Very sophisticated and understanding how to give the chinese people some part of what they want [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2984.7200000000003s)]
*  So that they're roughly happy enough to keep moving forward and i'm not going to morally judge whether it's right or wrong [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2991.44s)]
*  But it's just a comment on what the gameplay and the game theory seems to be coming from the leadership of china [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=2996.64s)]
*  So it's just I think this is it's it's it's good for the chinese people [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3003.44s)]
*  And the real question is what will it mean for the u.s. Economy if these guys get their um [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3008.08s)]
*  Get their [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3013.6s)]
*  Economy going again. We talked about this previously, but [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3014.8s)]
*  This is a good example [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3017.68s)]
*  of the [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3019.76s)]
*  Autocrat not necessarily being absolute [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3021.26s)]
*  uh in in their um authority [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3025.2s)]
*  and the sense that I think we get at this point coming out of china [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3028.32s)]
*  Is that there was enough dissent? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3034.08s)]
*  from the populace on the lockdown and the experience of the lockdowns and we can all go online and see the videos of [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3036.56s)]
*  Steel bars being put on doors to keep people in their apartment buildings and people screaming and buildings being on fire [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3042.16s)]
*  People can't escape the buildings how much of that was true or not and and riots in the street and people fighting with the covet testers [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3047.9199999999996s)]
*  How much of it is true or not? We don't really know [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3054.7999999999997s)]
*  But it certainly seems to indicate that there was enough dissent and enough unrest that in order to stay in power [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3058.24s)]
*  The ccp had to take action and they had to shift their position and shift their tone [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3064.48s)]
*  And I think it's a really important moment to observe that sometimes the ccp [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3069.44s)]
*  and you know [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3076.0s)]
*  Perhaps even we can extend this into other [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3077.36s)]
*  Autocratic regimes that we think are absolute in their authority and their in power and their power [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3080.06s)]
*  perhaps are necessarily influenced by the people that they are there to govern and that they are [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3086.08s)]
*  You know, uh ruling over and that [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3092.6400000000003s)]
*  While we don't think about these places as democracies [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3096.08s)]
*  Perhaps they're not entirely [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3099.68s)]
*  the traditionally defined autocracy [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3101.68s)]
*  That there is an influence that the people can have and maybe we see the same change happening in iran [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3104.72s)]
*  With young people and a population that's more modern that's growing and swelling in size that doesn't want to accept some of the [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3110.72s)]
*  traditional norms and the traditional [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3118.08s)]
*  Laws and you know, maybe that will kind of start to resonate around the world [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3120.72s)]
*  That the internet is starting to do what everyone hoped and wanted it to do which is the democratization of information the democratization [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3124.88s)]
*  of seeing other people's conditions and seeing what the rest of the world is and is like [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3132.3199999999997s)]
*  gives the populace the ability [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3136.88s)]
*  To rise up and to say this is what we want because we know that there are better things out there [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3139.44s)]
*  And these autocratic regimes have to start to shift slightly [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3144.7999999999997s)]
*  And over time maybe that has a real impact here's a specific statistic and chart for everybody [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3147.84s)]
*  the demographics of uh iran are [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3152.48s)]
*  incredibly, um [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3155.9s)]
*  Notable if you look at this chart [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3157.66s)]
*  For those of you listening it just shows people by age and how many what percentage of the population they are [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3160.64s)]
*  Or actually the world numbers of the population as you can see [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3166.64s)]
*  It's basically like a pair. Uh, you have very few old people and you have a lot of people in their 20s and younger [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3169.36s)]
*  And so young people no no jason it's really [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3176.08s)]
*  40s and 30s is really okay. So 40s 30s [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3179.66s)]
*  Uh, you don't have the geriatric population that you see in other countries like japan [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3183.52s)]
*  Um, and so the demographics of iran are extremely, uh weighted towards younger people [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3188.4s)]
*  Millennials gen xers and younger and uh, they have vpns virtual private networks. They can see everything happening [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3195.5s)]
*  Uh in the free world [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3202.8s)]
*  Versus let's say closed societies [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3206.0s)]
*  And so I think that's what gives me a lot of hope [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3208.0s)]
*  Is that these countries are going to have to evolve because young people are seeing how the rest of the world lives [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3210.32s)]
*  And I think that's a big part of the change termoth. What are your thoughts? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3216.16s)]
*  About iran specifically [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3220.56s)]
*  I think demographic change and then china and [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3222.56s)]
*  demographic change [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3225.82s)]
*  Protests i've said this before and i've been tweeting about this for years [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3227.52s)]
*  But people so poorly understand demographics everybody thinks that we have a surplus of people and we don't [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3230.88s)]
*  and we need to have a positive birth rate in order to kind of [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3237.04s)]
*  Continue to support the expansion of the world and gdp and we need that and right now we're not in that situation [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3240.4s)]
*  If you look at a country by country basis a lot of these countries [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3246.7200000000003s)]
*  um are facing that [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3249.92s)]
*  in a pretty cataclysmic way the most [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3252.4s)]
*  Sensitive country to this is china. I mean their population get current course and speed [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3255.12s)]
*  I think the last number is it's going to have by 2100. There'll be about 600 million people in china [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3261.04s)]
*  Which is unbelievably disruptive in a very negative way for them, right? [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3267.44s)]
*  Because you will have a lot of people who are entering the workforce having to support [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3271.6800000000003s)]
*  An entire cohort of people above them in terms of age right who are retired etc [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3277.52s)]
*  So the state's going to have to get much much more actively involved over the next 50 years in china [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3281.7599999999998s)]
*  And then you look at other countries like nigeria or india who are in uh, you know [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3287.6s)]
*  At the beginning of what could be a multi-decade boom [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3292.96s)]
*  Because you have 20 year olds that will be entering the workforce, you know [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3296.3199999999997s)]
*  They'll effectively work for less than their older counterparts, right? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3300.0s)]
*  So then there'll be an incentive then to bring work on shore into those countries [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3303.04s)]
*  And so it's going to have huge impacts because then you have rising gdp you'll have rising expectations of living quality [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3307.92s)]
*  You'll have rising expectations of how governments treat those people. So it's all kind of positive in general, but the world needs more people [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3315.52s)]
*  Let's just be clear, especially in western countries. We are going to be not we're not as badly off as china [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3323.6800000000003s)]
*  But we're not far behind. Yeah, here's a quick view of china and japan [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3330.08s)]
*  If you're just you know, these same kind of I don't know what they exactly call these charts are kind of like vertical histograms, but [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3333.52s)]
*  You start and again, you know data is hard to come by in some countries, but you know china's starting to get top heavy [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3339.44s)]
*  When compared to iran and then if you look at japan [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3346.0s)]
*  Quite stunning. There's just no young people left and they live very too much older ages in japan [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3349.28s)]
*  It's as longevity is one of their great strengths as a population as a country [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3355.36s)]
*  And so these demographics can't be fought. Uh, you're gonna have a contraction constricting economy in japan [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3359.68s)]
*  And their place in the world is going to be very very different [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3366.24s)]
*  Okay, where do we want to go to next you never asked my opinion on on [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3371.68s)]
*  One of these protests usually you just talked so go ahead. I didn't want to I didn't know I just talk [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3375.52s)]
*  No, I usually have to fight to give my opinion. Oh, here we go [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3380.48s)]
*  Listen have your agent call my agent. We'll talk about it. Okay, we'll talk about it [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3383.92s)]
*  I have a slightly different view of what's happening in china, uh, jason, which is [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3387.52s)]
*  You know, I think that the people there need to stop harassing the ccp [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3393.68s)]
*  You see the chinese communist party. They're the elites. They've set things up for the benefit of the people [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3398.0s)]
*  They're not engaged in shadow banning. They're just you know, they have a system there to you know to engage in censorship to prevent [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3403.44s)]
*  Abuse and harm. Yeah, right. That's the system continue. They've set up [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3410.64s)]
*  Right and the people just need to understand that that when they say things like [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3415.28s)]
*  You know when they oppose things like covet lockdowns like jay baracharya did they need to understand that that is engaging in abuse and harm [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3419.92s)]
*  Exactly. Yes, and you know what they they provide reeducation camps for citizens who need [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3428.32s)]
*  You know to um, maybe rethink their positions on freedom and their wages the hours they work [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3435.12s)]
*  And their and their social conditions you're you're absolutely correct china really has built a perfect model for a society [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3441.6s)]
*  Well, well said sax right now we can move forward. Let's go now. We're going forward. We are finally [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3448.16s)]
*  We're in agreement by the way, you know, that's gonna get clipped out and go viral. Well, you understand, right? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3453.7599999999998s)]
*  According to according to our elites according to our elites some elites yoel roth or taylor lorenz to criticize them [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3458.8799999999997s)]
*  Is a form of harassment [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3467.4399999999996s)]
*  You understand that right? So therefore what the people in china are doing specifically by opposing lockdowns [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3470.08s)]
*  You know, they're taking the jay baracharya point of view. They're engaging in harm and abuse [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3476.96s)]
*  And harassment of their betters of their elites disagreement [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3482.64s)]
*  Why won't they just submit to the social credit system that has been set up for them? [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3486.64s)]
*  For their benefit. It's for their benefit. Why question it? Yeah, just accept accept your fate and work hard [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3493.28s)]
*  For the good of the people great great points. Let's move forward. Should we talk about sales? [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3499.04s)]
*  No, I think it's actually a pretty it's a it's pretty good satire. I agree [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3502.72s)]
*  All right. I I think we have to talk about ftx. I I don't know if you saw [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3506.72s)]
*  and I [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3511.3599999999997s)]
*  The people covering for sbf [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3513.04s)]
*  It continues to be an absolute joke the number of interviews that sbf is doing is absurd [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3516.64s)]
*  But the people carrying water for him [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3523.2799999999997s)]
*  Is is even more offensive I mean if you're a criminal trying to cover up your crime, okay [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3525.6000000000004s)]
*  We get it. You're trying to cover up and stay out of jail [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3530.2400000000002s)]
*  but kevin o'leary, um who um [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3533.28s)]
*  Calls himself. Mr. Wonderful [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3537.2000000000003s)]
*  Was on cnbc trying to defend the fact [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3539.44s)]
*  That he was given [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3542.7200000000003s)]
*  This is stunning by the way [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3544.88s)]
*  15 fucking million dollars to be a spokesperson for ftx. So the grift [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3546.94s)]
*  Not only went to the press [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3552.7200000000003s)]
*  politicians [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3555.42s)]
*  Uh, but now commentators on cnbc [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3556.7200000000003s)]
*  15 million dollars to put that in context. I mean you're talking what an elite nba player gets from nike [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3560.7000000000003s)]
*  This does not exist in the world [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3567.6800000000003s)]
*  Uh, you know kevin o'leary might get you know 50 to 200k for speaking gigs, but nobody gets 15 million dollars to show [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3570.1600000000003s)]
*  Here's a 75 second clip that I don't know if you've all have seen [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3578.4s)]
*  but is [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3582.8s)]
*  Unbelievably stunning see on the other side of 75 seconds [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3584.22s)]
*  If you're a defense attorney that represents someone that you know is guilty, you gotta say yeah [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3587.74s)]
*  Well, they're innocent, but you may know they're guilty [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3592.4599999999996s)]
*  You may know they're guilty if you find someone if you watch someone kill someone. Yeah, they're innocent [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3594.8599999999997s)]
*  I don't think there's only the murder of my money in this case. Okay, it's it's murder of of ftx's money [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3599.74s)]
*  In my view everybody's look joe [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3605.5s)]
*  If you because it was ftx money that you got I don't I don't think you should be singing the blues right now at all [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3607.98s)]
*  Oh, yes, i'm singing the blues why because your 15 million didn't pan out that you that's a lot of money to be a paid [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3613.82s)]
*  Spokesperson it's a lot of money. You didn't have to do much for that. That's that's found money. That's a different decision [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3619.2400000000002s)]
*  That's a different discussion. I you know, you can make that decision on your own [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3623.82s)]
*  But i'm going to this point on money that if you want to say he's guilty before he's tried [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3627.42s)]
*  I just don't understand it, but it may end up costing you 15 for reputation on everything else [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3632.14s)]
*  That's the problem. That's why I stay on this pursuit. I'm very transparent about it. I've disclosed everything I know about it [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3637.1800000000003s)]
*  I will find out more information if I make the credit committee [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3642.22s)]
*  I will act as a fiduciary for everybody involved. I will testify [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3644.8599999999997s)]
*  I am an advocate for this industry and this changes nothing just look at the numbers that came out of circle today [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3648.62s)]
*  I'm an investor there, too [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3654.62s)]
*  You've got the I lost it all in ftx and we have a fantastic print on circle the promise of crypto remains [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3655.9s)]
*  This will not change it [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3662.62s)]
*  Pretty crazy 15 million bucks any thoughts on the continuing sbf saga sax [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3664.54s)]
*  Well, I don't know why we should care so much about him, I mean kevin leero, but um [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3670.86s)]
*  But look, I think it's indicative of all these guys that got money from this. Who is he? Who is he? [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3675.5s)]
*  He's one of the what he's on shark tank and he's a contributor to cnbc who's on multiple times a week [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3682.14s)]
*  The point is like you've got [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3687.6600000000003s)]
*  The grift i'm just trying to point out 15 million dollars to a cnbc commentator [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3690.38s)]
*  Is just an extraordinary payoff [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3695.98s)]
*  I've never heard of anything like that. I don't I don't think it's fair to pick on kevin o'leary per se [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3698.78s)]
*  Because there is a bunch of those guys that took money from him, you know a bunch of athletes did [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3704.38s)]
*  Probably a bunch of movie stars pats, you know republicans democrats. Yeah, like everybody got paid by this guy [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3709.7400000000002s)]
*  Okay [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3717.82s)]
*  Just like in the twitter example, I think it's important in this case to generalize [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3719.18s)]
*  Because the generalized thing is the real problem look if you want to focus on the crux of this [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3723.98s)]
*  You have a concept in law that sax knows better than the rest of us called fraudulent conveyance [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3729.42s)]
*  And we have example after example [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3734.38s)]
*  Where it does not matter whether it was in the bernie madeoff example or for example, jason [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3737.1800000000003s)]
*  We talked about it the guy in la that lost all the money client funds playing poker [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3741.5s)]
*  Yep, you have to give the money back [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3746.62s)]
*  Especially if it was fraudulently conveyed to you explain can you explain this in detail for a second? [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3748.8599999999997s)]
*  So the audience understands well on my understanding which is very basic and I think david can probably do a much better job is the following [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3753.9s)]
*  Which is [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3760.06s)]
*  If you get money [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3761.2599999999998s)]
*  some way [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3763.58s)]
*  But it comes from somebody who fraudulently acquired that money you have to give the money back [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3765.18s)]
*  So in this example what it would mean is if that they can show that that 15 million dollars that this guy got [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3771.9s)]
*  Came from sbf basically raiding the piggy bank [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3779.58s)]
*  of user accounts [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3784.06s)]
*  He's gonna have to pay the money back just like for example in the made-off fraud [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3786.7799999999997s)]
*  the [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3791.98s)]
*  The the folks that went to find the money were able to go back to folks that actually redeemed [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3793.58s)]
*  Even the beginning early ones and said I understand that you didn't know any better [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3798.46s)]
*  But this was fraudulently conveyed to you [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3801.8199999999997s)]
*  So we need the money back and they got the money back [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3803.9s)]
*  In that case if they had put a million in and it grew to three million [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3806.7s)]
*  They got their million principal back, but the two million in gains which were ill-gotten had to be returned returned returned [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3809.8199999999997s)]
*  As I understand it based on just what i've read that there's a 90-day rule around contributions meaning that [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3816.62s)]
*  If I think this has to do with the bankruptcy that that if he donated money within 90 days [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3822.8599999999997s)]
*  Then that can be unwound [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3829.1s)]
*  so [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3831.1s)]
*  90 days, yeah [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3832.22s)]
*  Yeah, but I do think it creates potentially a powerful incentive here [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3833.42s)]
*  by politicians and various political groups [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3837.7400000000002s)]
*  For him not to be convicted of fraud for him to be able to plead this out into some sort of negligence [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3841.26s)]
*  Because they don't have to give the money back. They keep the bag. What an incredible insight [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3846.46s)]
*  Well, this is what I think so interesting about the kevin o'leary thing. It's not about kevin o'leary [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3850.94s)]
*  But it's about the fact that the money was spread around so widely [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3855.1s)]
*  and into such like deep trenches of [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3859.1s)]
*  The regulatory society society like into the blog influencers [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3862.38s)]
*  Yeah, and basically I think the guy like cemented [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3867.9s)]
*  this he thought that like which which I think by the way is a really interesting product of [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3871.26s)]
*  The crypto ecosystem and the model that so many kind of crypto businesses have engaged in over the years [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3877.34s)]
*  Which is if you can fester the belief then there is a business if you cannot fester the belief [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3882.7000000000003s)]
*  There is no business that there isn't a fundamental productivity driver. It's about [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3888.06s)]
*  Building a belief system and you can buy a belief system if you can take money that people have given you [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3891.9s)]
*  You can embed it in influencers and celebrities [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3897.1s)]
*  And politicians and regulators and if you give it to enough of these people and you give enough of it to them [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3900.7000000000003s)]
*  Maybe that belief system solidifies and your thing becomes real [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3906.62s)]
*  Which is a classic rift technique by the way in the grifters. Oh, tell us all about it jake. Yeah. Yeah [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3910.46s)]
*  Is you have this? [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3915.82s)]
*  The master no, no, it's the patina and it's this uh, you know, you look like you're incredibly rich [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3917.1s)]

*  And then some other rich person comes and you get them to invest in something and then you abscond with the money [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3929.58s)]

*  Let me ask you guys a question or huge secondary sales. Yeah, let me ask you guys a question [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3968.2999999999997s)]
*  Do you think that a billion dollars of dark money could stop a red wave just asking for a friend? [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3972.7s)]
*  Billion dollars do you think it was overrated to democrat sex? No, honestly, do you think it's overrated the money? [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3980.14s)]
*  Yes, his mother was a huge democratic bundler [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3984.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and moreover the the specific politicians he needed to influence there. Yes, there were some republicans, but by and large [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3987.82s)]
*  It was the scc. Oh, yeah, so you're the first person to make this claim [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3994.86s)]
*  I want to say did you hear it here first on the only pod? [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=3997.98s)]
*  David sacks making the declaration that the real on the red wave was stopped because of well, let me ask you [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4002.7s)]
*  Let me ask a follow-up question. What do you think would have more impact? [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4008.3s)]
*  on our election [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4011.9s)]
*  enormous amounts of dark money going to democrats or [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4014.14s)]
*  extensive shadow banning of conservative influencers [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4018.54s)]
*  Yeah, which one do you think would have a bigger impact? We could [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4022.62s)]
*  And hold on a second in a 50 50 country where I mean the scales are like balance where these elections are just a few [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4025.1s)]
*  Thousand votes. Yeah, what do you think the result is going to be? [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4031.5s)]
*  If we actually have a level playing field we get rid of this swindler's dark money. Yeah, that's an interesting question [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4035.3399999999997s)]
*  Um, let me let me add a I think to that [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4040.2999999999997s)]
*  Um, what would have a bigger impact this uh, subverting? [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4042.8599999999997s)]
*  I think this is great except for when you guys had your fight like or [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4047.4199999999996s)]
*  Taking away a woman's right to choose after 50 years of giving it to them [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4050.94s)]
*  Which would have a bigger impact on the red wave that did have a big impact [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4053.9s)]
*  But I think we're gonna move past that I think we're gonna move past that. Yeah. All right. Great. Yeah [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4056.62s)]
*  Great great great strategic move. What do you think about the cinema? [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4060.62s)]
*  Kristen cinema kyrsten cinema flipping to independent. Do you think that's a big deal or I think I think it's really interesting [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4064.7s)]
*  I think it's actually a very extreme move on her part [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4069.74s)]
*  She's so first of all, I think she's great, you know, yeah, just tell us about her sex [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4073.02s)]
*  No, he well she's she's she is the senator from arizona [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4078.46s)]
*  Formerly democrat now independent who is in the mold of you know, john mccain who was a former senator from arizona [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4083.42s)]
*  sort of this maverick independent and she does not count out to her party orthodoxy and [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4090.14s)]
*  when biden [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4095.82s)]
*  Wanted to pass three and a half trillion of build back better spending [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4097.42s)]
*  She along with mansion opposed it and I think saved the administration [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4102.3s)]
*  From this gigantic boondoggle that would have been inflation much much worse now mansion got all the credit [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4106.400000000001s)]
*  But she was equally responsible for putting a hold on that and then as a result [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4110.96s)]
*  They only did the 750 billion inflation reduction act. So she's willing to buck her own party now as a result of that [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4115.76s)]
*  I think they were planning on she was going to get primaried that the progressive wing [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4122.64s)]
*  Of the party was planning on primaring her [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4127.280000000001s)]
*  And by moving to an independent in a sense, she preempts that [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4130.0s)]
*  Because what she's now saying is she's now sort of like, you know, uh bernie sanders is an independent or this guy [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4134.4800000000005s)]
*  Uh angus king from from maine. They still caucus with the democrats, but they're independents and the and the democrats don't run [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4141.2s)]
*  Uh candidates against them because they know [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4149.92s)]
*  That if they do you'll have a republican a democrat and independent [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4152.88s)]
*  And the democrats and the independents will split the vote and the republican will win. So basically she's now daring [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4157.2s)]
*  The democrats. Hey, if you want to run a candidate against me [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4163.120000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to sit around and get primaried by them you go ahead and run somebody but then we're both going to lose [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4166.4800000000005s)]
*  I like to they're a republican. That's what's smart about it is I think she's daring [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4172.160000000001s)]
*  Schumer to run somebody against her [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4176.8s)]
*  It's also interesting. She's she's the only [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4179.6s)]
*  Member of congress i've read that's non-theist, which is kind of like atheist [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4182.56s)]
*  She doesn't talk about god or doesn't believe in god and I think she's the first openly bisexual member of [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4186.4800000000005s)]
*  Congress. She's a maverick [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4192.08s)]
*  Certainly sax do you think she held up on making this decision until after that georgia senate runoff election [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4195.12s)]
*  Finished and do you think that it influenced the decision? I don't know but I I think that the [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4201.04s)]
*  Consideration here for her is yeah. Well, imagine if she doesn't make this move now, okay [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4206.08s)]
*  And then in two years, well, I guess really next year she gets primaried [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4211.84s)]
*  Okay, and then what if she loses the primary it's going to be very hard for her to run as an independent at that point [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4215.84s)]
*  It'll look like sour grapes sore loser, right? But if she goes independent now [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4221.599999999999s)]
*  She's saying listen, I'm running as an independent no matter what the question you have to make is what the democratic party [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4228.639999999999s)]
*  Is whether to support me or basically tank this election and throw it will we see more of this purple approach? [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4234.879999999999s)]
*  I was just going to ask you what does this mean for joe mansion? [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4241.44s)]
*  Well, I don't think joe mansion has this problem and i'll tell you why because um, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4245.28s)]
*  West virginia unlike arizona is like a plus 22 red state [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4249.12s)]
*  Joe mansion is the only politician in that state who could win that seat for the democrats when joe mansion retires [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4253.200000000001s)]
*  That seat is going republican [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4261.04s)]
*  And schumer knows this the democrats know this they think they're lucky stars every day that they got joe mansion [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4262.96s)]
*  Because otherwise that would be a republican seat [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4268.72s)]
*  And so look all this stuff about how the progressives were upset with mansion and all that papalicity he got [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4270.72s)]
*  That may be you know, the sort of progressive wing is going to say that publicly [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4276.5599999999995s)]
*  But the smart democrats know that they're very lucky to have a politician like joe mansion on their side of the aisle [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4280.4s)]
*  I could ask a question to you chermoth. Why? [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4286.48s)]
*  Do democrats [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4289.5199999999995s)]
*  Why why are they [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4292.08s)]
*  It seems to be so anti moderate democrats. Why are they so? [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4294.64s)]
*  resistant to [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4299.1s)]
*  The concept of a moderate democrat when obviously moderate democrats seem to have an advantage in these elections [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4300.88s)]
*  Well, no, I think david described it well, which is that in many of the seats [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4306.24s)]
*  This is both true for republicans and for democrats. You're not really competing in a general election [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4310.72s)]
*  You're competing in a prime primary and if you win a primary you're probably going to win [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4315.28s)]
*  So like, you know if you're in mississippi, for example, you just have to win the republican primary. Nothing else matters [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4318.88s)]
*  And then you're just going to skate to victory [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4324.0s)]
*  And so the real question is who votes in those are different oftentimes in who votes in the general [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4326.16s)]
*  And this is why you get this [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4331.52s)]
*  Dispersion that's happening where folks seem to be getting more and more extreme [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4333.9s)]
*  It's reflecting the sound bites that those primary voters want to hear and this is the big problem that we have and that's why like if you have [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4339.04s)]
*  A bunch of this, you know rank choice voting or you know [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4347.12s)]
*  These other kinds of methods it starts to clean that up so that you move people [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4351.04s)]
*  More into the moderate middle [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4355.360000000001s)]
*  But that's why that's why you have this crazy stuff happening. All right, everybody [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4358.0s)]
*  This has been another amazing episode of the all-in podcast for the dictator [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4360.88s)]
*  The sultan of science and david sax. I am jay cal. We'll see you next time. Bye. Bye [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&t=4365.360000000001s)]
