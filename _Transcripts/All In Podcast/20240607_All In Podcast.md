# DOJ targets Nvidia, Meme stock comeback, Trump fundraiser in SF, AppleOpenAI, Texas stock market
**All In Podcast:** [June 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE)
*  All right, everybody. Welcome to the world's greatest podcast. With me again, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=0.0s)]
*  today. The world's number one podcast. Yes, the world's number one podcast. We came in eighth [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4.0s)]
*  last week, I think, for those of you looking at the iTunes rankings, which is absurd. We've only [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=8.0s)]
*  got to beat Ben Shapiro. Number eight across all of Apple? Something like that. Yeah, whatever their top [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=13.52s)]
*  episodes are on the weekends. Well, that means we crushed on Spotify then. Probably. Yeah, I would [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=18.56s)]
*  guess. I don't know all the rankings, but. And I guess on YouTube, we got labeled with some COVID [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=23.68s)]
*  thingamajig. I mean, it's sort of going on at YouTube. What a joke. Like literally you're [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=29.52s)]
*  labeling COVID at this point. I mean, what a joke. Oh, my Lord. So I guess we have to at the top of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=35.12s)]
*  the show talk about the fundraiser. And I guess this like, Vinod Khosla came in hot this week [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=44.56s)]
*  and attacked the besties. Let's play the clip. What is your sense of the shifting winds in the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=51.68s)]
*  Valley around politics? I think for a very long time, the Valley was seen as sort of a liberal [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=58.08s)]
*  bastion. But, you know, if you listen to Elon Musk or you listen to All In podcast and that gang [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=63.44s)]
*  and others, it seems to be shifting potentially towards former President Trump. Is that just a [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=71.28s)]
*  small pocket or do you think that that's a real shift in terms of the way the Valley's thinking [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=77.12s)]
*  politically? The first thing I would say is All In podcast and some of the supporters there [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=82.4s)]
*  are not based in the Valley. I would say there's a bunch of MAGA extremists in every part of society [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=89.44000000000001s)]
*  and I hope we can prevent them from destroying democracy, which is probably the most important [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=97.04s)]
*  issue we face. All right, so why are you destroying democracy? No, no. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=103.04s)]
*  No, that's a good bit, Jake. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=108.0s)]
*  All right, David. If Vinod was at the conference, he got a little chippy here. Maybe he got a little [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=130.88s)]
*  bit out of line. He was a little bit out of line. What's your take? A little bit. A little bit. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=136.16s)]
*  A little bit. Well, first of all, Vinod should realize we're not MAGA extremists or extremists [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=140.32s)]
*  of any sort because he's at All In summit last year. He was great. Yeah, we like what he had to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=145.92s)]
*  say. Productive. And I certainly don't dispute his expertise and track record in tech. But in [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  addition to that, then he's saying that we're not based in Silicon Valley. We're not from Silicon [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=156.8s)]
*  Valley. We've all been here for decades. And then he doubled down on that in a tweet. So that's a [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=160.8s)]
*  bizarre statement. Maybe he thinks he gets to define people in or out of Silicon Valley. I don't [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=164.8s)]
*  really understand it. But to be frank, this is one of a series of statements that he's made recently [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  that I can only call insulting and childish. First, he had this tweet that he said that Trump [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=177.44s)]
*  supporters were lacking in empathy and caring. Then he had another tweet where he said that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=185.36s)]
*  Trump supporters weren't teaching good values to their kids. This caused Sean McGuire, who's [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=191.12s)]
*  a partner at Sequoia, to quote tweet him saying that I think that I'd rather raise my kids to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=196.08s)]
*  grow up to take after Ivanka Trump than Hunter Biden. And that got something like 20,000 likes. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=202.16s)]
*  And it was one of the most brutal ratios I've ever seen on a tweet. So in any event, this is just one [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=208.8s)]
*  in a series of partisan tweets. And look, I think you can take whatever position you want on a [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=215.6s)]
*  political candidate. I can understand if he doesn't like Trump, a lot of people don't. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=220.0s)]
*  He's raising money for Biden. That's fine. It doesn't bother me at all. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=224.96s)]
*  Yeah, he just had a fundraiser like two weeks ago or something. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=227.68s)]
*  Yeah, right. Exactly. That's not an issue at all. But what I do take offense at is [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=230.16s)]
*  labeling millions and millions of ordinary Americans as somehow lacking in empathy, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=235.52s)]
*  lacking in caring, not being good parents, because you don't like their support for Trump. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=240.72s)]
*  And I think that that is a statement that frankly reeks of being cocooned in an elite bubble for way [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=246.72s)]
*  too long. And let me just explain. If you look at where Trump's support is strongest, it's really [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=256.47999999999996s)]
*  in middle America, in sort of the heartland of America of what- [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=263.2s)]
*  In between the elite states. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=266.88s)]
*  Basically, the part of America that Kosovo is dismissively referred to as flyover country. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=268.47999999999996s)]
*  And it's a lot of the industrial Midwest. And frankly, that part of the country has not had [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  the same type of economic experience that we've had in Silicon Valley. They have not been [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=283.2s)]
*  beneficiaries of globalization. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=287.35999999999996s)]
*  Or equities. And they're in the working class and the working class in the factories got gutted. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=289.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, yeah, look, if you're in one of the handful of export industries in America, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=296.24s)]
*  and I'm talking about if you're in Hollywood or you're in big finance or you're in software, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=301.28s)]
*  then globalization has been great for you because it has created huge global markets [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=306.0s)]
*  for our products. However, if you're in an industry that has to compete with global exports, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=311.52s)]
*  then it's been very bad with you. And blue collar workers have been hurt, labor has been hurt, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=319.35999999999996s)]
*  people who work with their hands have been hurt. They have not benefited in the same way [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  from the system that we've had in this country for the last 30 years. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=328.64s)]
*  So you can understand why they would not be so enchanted with elite thinking. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=331.84s)]
*  Of course. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  And I think to then label those people as lacking in caring or empathy or not being good parents, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=337.84s)]
*  because they haven't had the same economic ride that you've had for the last 30 years. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=343.44s)]
*  And then you- [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=348.88s)]
*  It's a blind spot. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  You are the one who is fighting a legal battle to kick some of those people, the public- [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  The surfers at his beach. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=357.12s)]
*  Kick the public off of the public beach in front of your beach house. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=359.68s)]
*  And then you're saying they're the ones lacking in empathy. Dude, look in the mirror. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=364.48s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, listen, the great irony of this is, as you know, the Democrats were supposed to be [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=368.56s)]
*  the party of the working people and Biden was supposed to be the pinnacle of that, like fighting [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=373.92s)]
*  for unions, fighting for the working person. And so they've just lost that whole thing. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  And I'll say, like, it feels like a lot of people are tilted because they defeated Trump [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=382.0s)]
*  and now he's back. And so that tilts a lot of people. Like there was a lot of effort, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=386.0s)]
*  a lot of energy and a feeling of success that Trump was ousted. And the fact that the guy is [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=389.92s)]
*  now the front runner to be president again can be very tilting after feeling like you've already [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=396.64s)]
*  won the battle. And guess what? It's back. I will also defend Vinod real quick. I'll say, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=401.28s)]
*  having known Vinod for a long time, he's an investor with me. He's a guy I've [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=405.76s)]
*  come to appreciate and think highly of. We had him at the summit. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=410.56s)]
*  It was great at the summit. It was awesome. If you listen to his thing, he said the listeners [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=415.44s)]
*  of the pod and then he said MAGA extremists. They're not based in Silicon Valley. I think [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=420.08000000000004s)]
*  he was referencing that the listeners of the pod are not based in Silicon Valley and they're MAGA. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=424.88s)]
*  Yeah, I couldn't hear. I think what he meant to say was, and some of the supporters there are [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=429.6s)]
*  not based in Silicon Valley, meaning like the supporters. Chamath, your thoughts on Vinod's [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=433.52000000000004s)]
*  comments. Yeah, I think Vinod's comments are a microcosm of something that's a little bit [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  bigger than just him and I think is roughly emblematic of the mainstream media, which is, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=444.32s)]
*  I think the four of us have found over the course of these last four years doing the podcast, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=450.32s)]
*  a rhythm where there's a whole diversity of views. We've always respected each other. We've learned [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=456.8s)]
*  from each other. And each of us have taken turns expressing something that the others have ended [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=462.8s)]
*  up converging on. That's not a holistic statement on every issue, but it has happened. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=468.96s)]
*  And that's an incredible example of how you should figure things out from first principles, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=474.71999999999997s)]
*  especially things that matter. And I think this is the first time. And look, David said this a [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=480.79999999999995s)]
*  few years ago. He said, Sachs did, that the course of elections will be driven by podcasts. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=486.47999999999996s)]
*  And I didn't give that a full enough waiting at the moment when he said it. But I think what I'm [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=495.35999999999996s)]
*  realizing is it's not necessarily just that podcasts will frame elections, but it's the [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=502.88s)]
*  counterfactual, which is that it fills a vacuum. And I think what you're seeing right now are the [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=508.0s)]
*  reactions of people that have thrived in what used to work, which was a traditional media [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=514.0s)]
*  infrastructure that would shape how people were supposed to think. But then all of a sudden, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=520.64s)]
*  if you can have a platform like this, where people just talk from first principles, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=526.56s)]
*  respectfully, and then the chips are going to be what it is, and people will come to their own [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=531.4399999999999s)]
*  conclusions. I think that that's what people are reacting to. So I think what the note is reacting [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=537.1999999999999s)]
*  to is this sort of discomfort where you see four reasonable, intelligent people all of a sudden [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=542.72s)]

*  is the planted orthodoxy of what you're supposed to think. And that's disconcerting to him. It's [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=556.0s)]
*  just disconcerting and confusing maybe to Sorkin, who I think is a wonderful reporter and a thinker. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=562.2399999999999s)]
*  It's disconcerting, Jason, to every single media outlet over the last week that's breathlessly [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=567.8399999999999s)]

*  emails is they don't get a chance to frame what we think. You can listen to the podcast and know [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=577.36s)]
*  what we think. This is the future of how smart, reasonable, moderate people should make decisions. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=583.6s)]
*  It is an example. Talking to somebody you disagree with does not make your opinion bastardized. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=589.2s)]
*  It actually makes your opinion valuable. There are these simple truths to living a productive life [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=596.32s)]

*  you disagree, you can hear them out. So that's what's happening right now. And I think that [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=606.96s)]
*  that's why we all need to sort of stand together and lock in arms and just keep moving forward. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=612.88s)]
*  It is something really important here that's happening. And I think that's why the media [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=617.84s)]

*  you're friends with Vinod, as you mentioned, and you've always said to me and in our personal [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=628.4000000000001s)]

*  your thoughts on this, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=644.48s)]
*  Vinod Thakur The unfortunate reality in a voting system and election cycle like we're in, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=645.36s)]
*  Vinod went and did a fundraiser, it's public, but he did a fundraiser for Biden a few weeks ago. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=650.32s)]
*  And he wants to win the election, he wants to make his horse win. There's a lot of reasons why [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=654.72s)]
*  I'm sure Vinod has chosen that person to be his horse. And so when you get on the playing field, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=660.08s)]
*  you got two teams, only one team wins. So, you know, everyone pulls out all the stops to win. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=666.4000000000001s)]
*  One of the things that is done is unfortunate. And it over time causes an erosion and a hardening [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=671.6800000000001s)]
*  into a kind of polarity between all people, which is that you call the other side wrong or bad or [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=676.88s)]
*  extreme. The term that he used, which really I think personifies the problem is he said their [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=684.5600000000001s)]
*  listeners are their MAGA extremists. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=690.96s)]
*  Aaron Ross Extremists being the word, right? MAGA just means [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=693.44s)]
*  make America great again, which I think everybody wants to make America great again. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=696.0s)]
*  Vinod Thakur Whatever the extremism phrase is used by both parties to describe the points of [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=699.2s)]
*  view of the other side. And what I think is lacking is a reshifting of the perspective to say their [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=705.6800000000001s)]
*  views are valid. I acknowledge their views. I hear them. I know why they feel that way. I'm [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=712.24s)]
*  understanding where that group of people are coming from. And to have that acknowledgement, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=716.88s)]
*  unfortunately, softens and weakens your position and ability to go out and win an election. And [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=721.52s)]
*  so both sides harden themselves and use terms like this to try and discredit the other side. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=725.12s)]
*  So it's unfortunate to see, I think we all understand where someone who's trying to win [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=731.04s)]
*  a battle on the field is coming from when they're trying to do this. But I do think that what is [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=735.44s)]
*  deeply lacking in the erosion that's arisen is because we can't say, I hear you, I see the [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=739.44s)]
*  problems. I recognize you as people just like us. You have kids, your families, and you have a [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=744.08s)]
*  different point of view on the policies that will work and the individual that will realize those [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=751.5200000000001s)]
*  policies. Aaron Ross I also think it's important to make sure that we reiterate again, at the sake [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=755.12s)]
*  of being pedantic, the facts, which is this is a nonpartisan show, and it is a platform that has [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=759.84s)]
*  showcased and given time to Democrats and Republicans and independents. And they've all [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=766.96s)]
*  taken us up on it. So that thought by the note is at best incomplete, and more appropriately, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=774.1600000000001s)]
*  just stupid and factually wrong. That's a good point. Larry Summers spoke at the same conference [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=782.24s)]
*  that the note Larry Summers, Dean Phillips, Bobby Kennedy, Chris Christie, I mean, this is a spectrum [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=786.88s)]
*  of people that we are bringing on again, so that you can hear from them in an unfiltered way and [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=793.6s)]
*  come to your own conclusion. That's why we were number eight last week. That's the exact reason [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=803.6800000000001s)]
*  why. And I think that that's very scary because instead of power brokers being able to filter an [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=809.36s)]
*  opinion, you now have an opportunity to just hear it for yourself, discuss it amongst your friends, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=814.88s)]
*  and come to your own conclusion. So we have always been bipartisan here. And we will continue to be [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=820.32s)]
*  bipartisan. The second thing is, and I just want to say this again, I have asked the White House [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=825.5200000000001s)]
*  for President Biden to come on the show. Oh, come on the show, please. Yeah. Yeah, we've offered the [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=830.32s)]
*  exact same thing. We are just we are just waiting. People really don't want me to be friends with you [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=835.2800000000001s)]

*  Zach. And these are people who are mutuals, I just want to say. And I want to just tell them all [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=843.6s)]
*  equally to go themselves here, you can bleep out the F word. Like I'm not picking my friends based [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=848.32s)]
*  on their political parties or their leanings or who they're supporting for president. The way I [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=853.36s)]
*  look at this axe is at this point, we're all Americans, we're in this together. America survived [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=857.2s)]
*  survive Trump's presidency, America is going to survive Biden's presidency, the democratic process, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=864.1600000000001s)]
*  it is very messy. Everybody gets to have a voice. And let's just pause for a second here and open up [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=869.6800000000001s)]
*  the aperture. Let's be thankful that everybody gets to have a say. Let's keep it from getting [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=874.64s)]
*  personal. Have to humans on this planet Earth do not have a voice. The one thing that's trending [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=879.28s)]
*  in the wrong direction globally is people living in a democracy. It's the one thing not getting [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=884.88s)]
*  better. We have a lot of work to do in this country. We have to respect each other like we try to do [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=889.12s)]
*  here on this podcast. And we have to talk about the important issues. We all agree the budget's [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=894.08s)]
*  out of control. We all agree the education system sucks. We live in a multipolar world, we have to [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=897.92s)]
*  figure that out. When we should go to war when we shouldn't, when we need to stay out of things, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=902.64s)]
*  these are complicated issues. And name calling and this presidency is not as important as tackling [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=907.68s)]
*  these issues together as Americans. I hope everybody can keep that in mind. So let's debate this. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=913.28s)]
*  May the best candidate win. And then let's move on and solve some problems here. Okay, and it's [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=918.48s)]
*  getting very personal. Well said, really well said. I know I'm really hurt by this because I [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=924.56s)]
*  tell you personally, it's very hurtful to me because I value our friendships and they're [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=929.44s)]
*  picking on the wrong guy because you're the most loyal guy. And so it's kind of like it's going to [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=932.96s)]
*  be the least effective because you care what they think. J. Cal, that's the problem. So they can get [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=936.8000000000001s)]
*  to you. You can ask me if I do that. Don't tell me what I think. Sex, you can ask me. Okay. I actually [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=940.72s)]
*  care about the two of you bicker like brothers. No, we do. But I know I just have to retrain [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=945.9200000000001s)]
*  sex that he can't tell me what I think. Yeah, no, because you do that. You put words in my mouth. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=950.72s)]
*  For all listeners, I just want you to know they've been bickering like this for 20 years. So it's [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=955.36s)]
*  the funniest. Here's the point. It happens even worse offline. We're not on the show. It's [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=958.8s)]
*  unbelievable. You're ruining it. J. Cal, you're just ruining it. I know. Here's the thing. I [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=963.3599999999999s)]
*  respect, you know, all of my friends and I like having a diversity of opinions that makes life [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=968.8s)]
*  more interesting for me. And then to tell me I can't be friends with this person, that person, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=973.52s)]
*  the way I grew up, my dad had a bar, Hells Angels, cops, firefighters, just everybody was allowed to [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=977.68s)]
*  come and hang out at the bar. Like we're here. We're having a discourse. Everybody's welcome for [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=983.28s)]
*  a seat at the table. You don't LGBTQ with all of them, the entire rainbow. What people haven't [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=988.0s)]
*  figured out yet is like cancel culture is over. Virtue signaling is over. Absolutely. Dei is over. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=992.8s)]
*  It's off trend, not on trend. And the people who are still tweeting these blanket statements, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=999.2s)]
*  and they're trying to demonize the entire other side with unfactual unfounded potshots are just [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1004.32s)]
*  making fools of themselves. And you can see that in there. You can see that in the reaction on x. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1010.72s)]
*  All right, let's move on. We have some breaking news here. Oh, no. Just to put things on a happier [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1016.72s)]
*  note. What happened? Did Uber get bought by Tesla just launched the Tesla Mezcal? Oh, breaking news [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1021.6s)]
*  story. Hold on. It's a breaking news story. Tesla has launched Mezcal in that beautiful lightning [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1028.4s)]
*  bottle. I just ordered my bottle of this like two seconds ago while we were doing the show. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1035.52s)]
*  Because this sold out in like two hours before and now the bottles of the original Tesla tequila [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1041.04s)]
*  go for like $2,000 now on eBay. Breaking news. So get yours. Get yours now if it's still [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1046.24s)]
*  smoking Mezcal. There you go. Wait a second. Is this going to compete with the all in [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1052.16s)]
*  a little bit? A little bit. Uh oh. Well, I think we're all sold out by the time we launch our [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1055.68s)]
*  bottle. We're both going to be sold out. We're both going to be sold out. Like everybody can see that [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1060.8s)]
*  everybody can win. It's not a zero sum game. Everybody can secure the bag. All right, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1064.4s)]
*  let's get into the docket. Enough of the self referential influencers. Now, did you guys see [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1069.36s)]
*  my deck this month? We're all influencers. We're all influencers. Absolutely. Absolutely. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1073.36s)]
*  There's a lot of federal regulation going on around AI as we know. Regulatory capture. Shout [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1078.3999999999999s)]
*  out to our guy Bill Gurley who did a great talk last year about this. On Wednesday, the New York [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1084.24s)]
*  Times reported that the DOJ and the FTC had struck a deal on how to go after AI incumbents. Here's [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1088.7199999999998s)]
*  the terms of the deal. And again, this is all breaking. The DOJ gets to investigate whether [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1094.24s)]
*  NVIDIA violated antitrust laws. They didn't specify what they're going after here, but it [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1098.96s)]
*  could include the NVIDIA use of CUDA software to lock customers into using their GPUs or maybe how [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1104.96s)]
*  NVIDIA distributes their GPUs to customers. There's a lot of regulation around that. And the FTC [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1111.52s)]
*  takes the lead on looking into open AI's conduct and Microsoft's AI deals. Obviously, there's been [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1116.0s)]
*  a ton of those, including acquirers, et cetera. And then just this morning, the Wall Street Journal [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1120.64s)]
*  reported that the FTC had opened a probe into Microsoft's deal with inflection AI. That's the [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1125.28s)]
*  one, if you remember, where they bought the staff and then did some fecacca crazy commerce deal [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1129.68s)]
*  where they gave them a bunch of money, I guess, to bail out the investors. And that one is as [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1135.76s)]
*  conflicted up and down as you could possibly imagine. They know Microsoft structured that deal [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1139.68s)]
*  in a way that could avoid regulatory scrutiny. You heard that here first, actually. We talked about [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1144.72s)]
*  this concept of a shadow acquirer on this very program when we saw it because we'd never seen a [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1149.36s)]
*  deal like that. It includes that $650 million licensing fee. All right. There's tons of other [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1153.68s)]
*  angles here, but let's start with you, Chamath. What are your thoughts on this regulatory capture [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1160.0800000000002s)]
*  and NVIDIA's ascension? For those of you not watching, it's almost become the largest market [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1167.44s)]
*  cap company in tech. Actually, today, NVIDIA passed Apple for a moment in time. So this is pretty [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1173.52s)]
*  crazy what we've seen with NVIDIA. And here we go, regulatory capture coming in hot. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1179.3600000000001s)]
*  Chamath, your thoughts? I have two thoughts. They're sort of mixed emotions. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1183.6s)]
*  The first is, I think the DOJ and the FTC are totally way out of their ski tips on this. This [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1189.28s)]
*  is a totally nascent industry. We don't have any good examples of end user use cases, either at the [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1196.4s)]
*  enterprise or amongst consumers. We only have 18 months of spend history. It is true that we've [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1203.44s)]
*  spent probably $750 billion to a trillion dollars collectively now on things with the AI label, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1211.04s)]
*  but it is also true that that's probably generated less than $10 billion in revenue. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1217.92s)]
*  So I don't see what they're exactly investigating in an extremely immature market where we haven't [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1223.04s)]
*  yet seen one cycle of boom and bust so that we know what we're actually dealing with. So it's [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1230.96s)]
*  way too premature and it's just people afraid and tilting at windmills. The second part, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1236.72s)]
*  the part that's mixed though is we are seeing a clever form of deal making that these huge [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1243.2s)]
*  hyperscalers are doing to work around the traditional constraints that you've had on [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1249.68s)]
*  businesses. Jason, you and I worked at AOL in a moment where AOL paid a very dear cost for [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1254.96s)]
*  essentially round tripping revenue. Yep. Microsoft had to go through a huge DOJ [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1261.92s)]
*  inquiry and a settlement decree and they were in the penalty box for most of Steve Ballmer's tenure [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1268.24s)]
*  as a CEO. A lost decade, yeah. And the handcuffs came off when Satya took over that business. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1273.52s)]
*  So I think what I'm trying to say is folks have become extremely sophisticated at replacing [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1278.8000000000002s)]
*  round tripping with these complicated tack 2.0, whatever you want to call it, credit-oriented [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1285.6000000000001s)]
*  deals. They'll finance you to buy their own chips. All of this stuff has to be scrutinized [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1292.0s)]
*  a little bit more. So that part I support, but all of a sudden launching an antitrust [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1299.0400000000002s)]
*  investigation makes no sense. So I really think the inquiry should be coming from a [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1304.16s)]
*  SEC about is this real revenue? That's actually the key issue. And this goes to Chamath, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1308.8s)]
*  what we talked about. If we're going to police something, tactics make sense, not future [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1313.84s)]
*  competition, which has been Lena Kahn's sort of approach to this and she's only going to be [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1319.28s)]
*  in the position for another couple of months. But the election goes the way it's going, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1324.48s)]
*  so this might all be moot. Freeberg, I want to get your thoughts on this. We had that great talk, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1328.0s)]
*  2,851 miles from Bill and regulatory capture at the summit. It would be in the show notes if [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1332.56s)]
*  you haven't seen it. It's a great talk. Freeberg, your thoughts on this? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1339.04s)]
*  I don't know what regulatory capture in video. Are you talking about regulatory capture of [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1343.2s)]
*  Nvidia? Just regulatory capture in the framing of AI. Is it too early? Hey, we're not even in the [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1348.8s)]
*  first inning here and already we're going to start investigating everybody and it just seems [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1355.84s)]
*  pretty sure. One of the silly aspects is they just passed this law in California. Newsom warns [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1361.36s)]
*  against perils of over-regulating AI. Oh, good. Governor Newsom warned on Wednesday against [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1367.9199999999998s)]
*  stifling the burgeoning AI sector. I mean, Newsom is well informed by the tech community. So I don't [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1375.9199999999998s)]
*  think he, and he's also an intelligent person, so I don't think he kind of, you know, fall quickly [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1380.8799999999999s)]
*  in line on this one. But the way that the statutes were written is there's a definition on the size [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1384.96s)]
*  of a model, which in and of itself is very quickly changing. As we know, we've seen recently [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1390.32s)]
*  significant reductions in model size that actually improve performance overall of the model for [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1395.6s)]
*  specific applications. And it's very likely we end up seeing a lot of more smaller targeted models [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1401.76s)]
*  being used in specific applications instead of one massive general purpose model being used, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1407.76s)]
*  or networks of smaller models, which is really where I think the industry is going. And if [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1412.8s)]
*  that's where things go, then this statute doesn't even matter. It makes no sense anymore. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1417.12s)]
*  And that shows you, I think, how quickly things are changing. They go and they get, quote, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1421.1999999999998s)]
*  experts' opinions. In a couple of months, those experts come back. They're like, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1424.8799999999999s)]
*  here's the size of a model that you need to be regulating. And then the legislators run [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1428.4799999999998s)]
*  and they write the code, they pass the statute. And all of a sudden, it doesn't even make sense [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1433.1999999999998s)]
*  anymore. So yes, I don't think we really know where this technology is all falling out at this [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1437.84s)]
*  point. And I think it's very difficult to have the government kind of reach in too quickly [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1442.0s)]
*  to try and identify what they should and shouldn't be allowing to happen from a free market [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1447.84s)]
*  perspective. Your thoughts, David Sachs, especially in light of the fact that [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1451.84s)]
*  looking like we're going to have some regime change in Washington and the FTC is going to [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1457.52s)]
*  turn over, obviously, if that happens. Well, look, I agree with you guys. This is just too [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1462.4s)]
*  soon to be opening these investigations. It's true that OpenAI and NVIDIA have leads in their [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1466.88s)]
*  respective markets, but that's all it is at this point. It's way too early in the development of [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1473.1200000000001s)]
*  these markets to say that these are clearly monopolists. There's still a lot of competition [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1478.48s)]
*  going on. If a few years from now, NVIDIA still has whatever, 85%, 90% market share, and no one's [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1483.3600000000001s)]
*  even close to catching up, then maybe you consider it a monopolist. Same thing with OpenAI, but it [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1489.8400000000001s)]
*  just seems very early to be rushing into investigations of these companies. I mean, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1496.16s)]
*  the AI market is what, 18 months old to two years old, maybe at most? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1500.72s)]
*  I'd say two is a good way to look at it. Yeah. So it's just very early to be doing this. Look, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1505.28s)]
*  I think this is of a piece with, remember that executive order or whatever that, remember when [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1509.8400000000001s)]
*  the White House issued that 100 page plus executive order on AI regulation? We covered it on the show. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1515.28s)]
*  We also thought that was too soon. We thought that if the internet had been regulated in that way, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1522.48s)]
*  in circa 1995 or 1997, it never would have blossomed the way that it did. You want to [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1529.52s)]
*  give these markets some time to play out before you bring down the heavy hand of regulation on them. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1536.0s)]
*  It just seems to me like the administration is getting carried away here with this desire to [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1542.8s)]
*  regulate this new space. I mean, frankly, it's of a piece with, I would say, an innovation hostile [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1547.44s)]
*  agenda. You also have the attacks on crypto. You just had Biden veto a bill that would have finally [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1556.3200000000002s)]
*  given crypto a regulatory framework in the US. It passed with 60 votes in the Senate, including [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1562.72s)]
*  Democrats like Chuck Schumer, and it still wasn't good enough. Oh, and it was based on a framework, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1568.88s)]
*  I think that came from the SEC. But Biden is basically in the Elizabeth Warren camp that he's [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1574.0s)]
*  going to give no quarter to crypto. So you've got hostility to AI. You've got hostility to crypto. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1578.72s)]
*  You've got hostility to M&A. No one can get an M&A deal through right now. You put all these [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1585.68s)]
*  things together. Plus, you've got hostility to options as compensation in terms of the [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1590.88s)]
*  25% unrealized gains tax. You add up all these things. And again, I think this is an agenda [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1596.96s)]
*  that does not benefit Silicon Valley at all. Well, and if you want to understand why people [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1604.4s)]
*  are coming to your fundraiser tonight, if you put all this together, it doesn't take a genius to [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1609.3600000000001s)]
*  figure out that if you're a venture capitalist or an entrepreneur, and you want to see M&A, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1613.5200000000002s)]
*  and you want to see entrepreneurship, and you want to see your companies thrive, you want to [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1617.0400000000002s)]
*  see your employees get rich and have options. Biden is basically handing the election to Trump. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1620.0s)]
*  It's like he's doing everything he can to basically alienate Silicon Valley. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1625.44s)]
*  And capitalism. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1630.0s)]
*  And you're exactly right. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1630.88s)]
*  And innovation. I wouldn't even say it's Silicon Valley. It's like if you're going to go and build [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1631.92s)]
*  things that are at the bleeding edge. The government used to be the most critical supporter of that. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1635.8400000000001s)]
*  If you think about space or defense, these were areas, the internet itself. The government was [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1643.3600000000001s)]
*  the partner of private industry to make sure that there was no regulation. And that really, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1648.96s)]
*  exactly. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1654.24s)]
*  Looking innovation could happen. That should be their role. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1654.72s)]
*  And this speaks to this de-cell versus acceleration movement that we see here in [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1657.92s)]
*  Silicon Valley. And this is what we see in Texas, Florida, UAE, Riyadh, Doha. There are places in the [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1663.28s)]
*  world, Singapore, where people are accelerating innovation. And this is what humans want. Not [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1670.4s)]
*  just entrepreneurs, not just venture capitals. All of us want to see an acceleration of innovation. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1676.5600000000002s)]
*  Everybody wants to see prosperity. And if you put yourself up as the de-cell candidate, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1681.84s)]
*  we're not going to allow M&A, we're going to screw with options, we're going to do all the stuff. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1687.04s)]
*  People are just not going to vote for you. And people want crypto legal. So take the memo. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1690.24s)]
*  I mean, this, I mean, the fact that the Democrats can't field a candidate that aligns with the, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1694.8s)]
*  what humanity wants is absolutely mind boggling. This is why I think Biden's getting hot swapped [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1701.04s)]
*  this month. You heard it here first. He's got, no, Gavin is going to be running for president. It's [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1706.64s)]
*  going to be Trump and Gavin. They are hot swapping Biden after this first debate. Biden is going to [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1712.64s)]
*  get demolished by Trump in the debate. It's going to be elder abuse. He's getting wiped out and hot [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1717.2s)]
*  swapped. You heard it here first. Well, there's a lot of conspiracy theorists online who agree [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1722.0800000000002s)]
*  with you. A lot of tit for tat speculation that he's going to get switcheroo. Hot swap. But look, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1727.68s)]
*  I think you make the correct point, which is, I didn't really think about it this way, but you're [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1734.0s)]
*  right. Biden is the D-cell candidate. And- Nobody wants that. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1738.24s)]
*  Also, Trump has shown a learning curve where he recently has been saying positive things about [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1742.3200000000002s)]
*  crypto. And he's always, I think, been more pro-economic growth. He was a real estate [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1747.2s)]
*  developer from the private sector. He actually understands the economy. So there's no question [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1751.8400000000001s)]
*  that he would be more pro-innovation, much more pro-innovation than Biden. And to your point about [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1756.64s)]
*  this is one of the reasons why people are coming to the fundraiser, I had someone from the campaign [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1762.72s)]
*  said something very interesting to me. She said that we've never seen this many new donors [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1766.88s)]
*  at an event before. So we're turning out the new donors for this reason. And we're not going to be [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1772.24s)]
*  intimidated by people calling us names. It's like, look, in any normal election, people in an industry [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1779.68s)]
*  would vote for the candidate who they see as most aligned with what is good for them, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1787.68s)]
*  their families, their industry. If you made a list, let's just make the list here right now. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1794.48s)]
*  Make the list of things Trump is in support of, right? And Republicans are in support of right [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1799.1200000000001s)]
*  now. They're going to be pro M&A. They're going to be pro crypto. They're going to be pro less [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1803.52s)]
*  taxes. They're going to be pro law and order. You know what? That's where I align. Those are the [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1808.56s)]
*  things I want. So if you just list the issues for me, despite how I might feel about Trump and [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1812.88s)]
*  some of the things he's done, he checks off all my boxes. He checks off all my boxes. And I think [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1818.16s)]
*  that's what's happening here. And, you know, people were scared to come out and say, this person [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1823.3600000000001s)]
*  checks off all my boxes. The Democrats need to realize they're out of sync with America. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1827.8400000000001s)]
*  They're out of sync with powerful people in America, especially the donor base. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1831.7600000000002s)]
*  They're the D cell candidate party now. And they just have to flip this thinking they're going to [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1835.68s)]
*  get demolished. It is going to be a landslide at this point. People want jobs and prosperity [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1840.8s)]
*  from your lips to God's ears. Do the hot swap. I mean, I don't really have a lot more to say. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1847.2s)]
*  Yeah, you don't think take the one, take the one. I mean, and crypto is such an obvious win. And [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1854.0s)]
*  you know what? Trump's anti EV right now. He's been wailing on EVs. I guarantee you that's the [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1860.08s)]
*  next thing. I bet you next week he comes out next week, within the next two weeks. Here's my [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1864.8799999999999s)]
*  prediction. Trump says, you know what, EV is not so bad. Remember, he's been saying EVs, nobody [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1870.0s)]
*  wants these things were subsidizing. I bet you next week or maybe in 30 days, I'm making a [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1874.8s)]
*  prediction here. You bank the prediction in 30 days, Trump comes out magically in support of EVs. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1879.28s)]
*  Well, I just think that his point is that people shouldn't be forced to buy EVs. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1885.28s)]
*  Right. I mean, I don't think he's against them per se. I think he's against people being forced. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1888.96s)]
*  Look, I think that what the new administration, hopefully, or what Trump should propose is [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1894.3999999999999s)]
*  effectively a modus vivendi with big tech, where the point is that if you stop censoring our people, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1899.52s)]
*  if you stop censoring conservatives, if you restore the civil liberties of the average American to [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1906.32s)]
*  say what they want online, to basically bank online, to stop essentially deplatforming and [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1911.76s)]
*  censoring people, then we will let you innovate. We'll let you do M&A. We'll let you get back to [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1918.08s)]
*  business. That basically is the basis for a peace agreement between big tech and the Republican [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1922.88s)]
*  Party. Yeah. And by the way, I'd say in the next 30 to 60 days, you're going to see 10 incredibly [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1929.6000000000001s)]
*  high profile people come out and support Trump if Biden isn't swapped out. And when I say high [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1937.1200000000001s)]
*  profile, I have the inside line on this extremely high profile people, not just Doug Leone, not just [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1941.0400000000002s)]
*  David Sachs and Shamal Patea. It is going to be about 10 high profile people who are much higher [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1945.8400000000001s)]
*  profile, respectively, than Shamath and Sachs and Doug Leone. So just wait for it, folks. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1950.96s)]
*  You cannot be a decelerist in this world. Let's keep moving. Roaring Kitty, aka Keith Gill, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1956.16s)]
*  just disclosed a nine figure position in GameStop. Yes, we're back to where this podcast started. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1962.88s)]
*  We're talking about GameStop and stonks. As crazy as it is. And E-Trade is considering [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1968.24s)]
*  suspending his account. This is going to take a little bit of background. I apologize here. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1974.56s)]
*  Deep platforming him. Here we go again. Quick background. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1977.68s)]
*  You remember the first basically viral moment for this podcast, this AI moment. I remember I was [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1982.96s)]
*  in Tahoe skiing was the GameStop saga back in 2021. Thousands of retail investors following [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1988.32s)]
*  this individual, Keith Gill, were posting in this subreddit called WallStreetBets, if you're not [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=1994.56s)]
*  familiar. And they created a massive short squeeze and they sent the stonk flying. Robinhood [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2001.52s)]
*  halted the trading. Remember, Vlad came on that one all went crazy. We covered that all. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2006.08s)]
*  And then Keith Gill went silent for the past three years on Twitter and Reddit. He said nothing. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2010.6399999999999s)]
*  Then on May 12, he posted this meme on X, which has been viewed 28 million times. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2015.4399999999998s)]
*  Now, if you don't know this meme, this is the lean forward meme when you've got a game controller [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2023.76s)]
*  in your hand, it is a way to signal like, hey, we're getting to the boss level, it's going to [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2028.24s)]
*  get exciting. Here's your GameStop chart, folks. You see that first peak, that's when we reported [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2033.04s)]
*  on it back in 2021. And here we go again, it just had a slow ride down for three years and [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2038.08s)]
*  popped up again. So GameStop stock tripled at the posting of that meme. Why is this important? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2043.92s)]
*  Well, he has a huge position, he increased it from 200,000 shares, basically to 5 million, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2051.12s)]
*  had 120,000 call options to multiple comment on all this in a moment. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2057.84s)]
*  If he exercised all these calls, Gill could own an additional 12 million shares. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2063.04s)]
*  Here's Gary Gensler, who was on CNBC Wednesday trying to calm the markets down and or try to [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2067.2799999999997s)]
*  get control of this craziness. Here's the clip. I said, you look, I want to put up a cryptogram [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2074.48s)]
*  and it's of a chair leaning up, which we know from video game playing means, come on, this is the [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2082.0s)]
*  ninth inning, get ready. And we know that I'm a person who happens to like the stock of GameStop. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2087.68s)]
*  This is the single, come on, get ready. Is this something hypothetically that is that the SEC [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2093.6s)]
*  should worry about? Look, again, it's not so hypothetical because you're describing things [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2099.44s)]
*  that are in the public domain and in the public is, you know, interested in. So, but generally [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2104.96s)]
*  speaking, you have to make sure that you don't mislead the public and that you don't in any way [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2112.8s)]
*  do things in the markets that may be manipulative or misleading. And so that's the key thing in our [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2119.92s)]
*  capital market. No, the key thing is if you can cure it with disclosure, this is brand ice. You know, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2128.96s)]
*  if they disclose that this is something that they are called action, then you can't go after them. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2134.32s)]
*  Disclosure is one really key part of our capital markets. When you buy the stock of a company, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2139.28s)]
*  you expect that they give you full and fair disclosure. That's, by the way, not what you're [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2145.6800000000003s)]
*  getting right now in this crypto field. So I just, you know, cautionary tale there, that disclosure. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2150.6400000000003s)]
*  But disclosure doesn't necessarily protect a bad actor if they're manipulating a market. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2158.0800000000004s)]
*  Shamath, you've been you've had a lot of comments on the markets and specifically this one over the [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2164.8s)]
*  years. What are your thoughts? Is posting this meme, stock manipulation or disclosure? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2170.4s)]
*  No, it's he's posting a meme. Okay, thank you. He put a picture on the internet. Okay. I mean, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2178.0s)]
*  again, this is like the problem that we have, which is that he disclosed his position in a [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2185.6000000000004s)]
*  different way. Now we don't know whether that disclosure is accurate, because I think it was [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2192.0s)]
*  just a screenshot of like some statement inside of a Reddit thread, right? And then that got posted [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2196.32s)]
*  many times elsewhere. Is this accurate? I don't know. Because he has no obligation as an individual [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2202.0s)]
*  to do any of this stuff. Because he's not running a hedge fund and he's not running other people's [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2209.52s)]
*  money. Now, if he was acting in concert with other people, you could say, Hey, hold on a second, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2214.24s)]
*  if you're repping not just your money, but other people's money, and you did this, then there's [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2221.2s)]
*  probably a disclosure obligation there. But at the end of the day, this is a guy that acted and [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2225.4399999999996s)]
*  basically created hype. And right now, the SEC does not have a framework to deal with that, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2235.04s)]
*  because the rules that existed didn't understand social media and whatnot. And he's also not a [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2244.0s)]
*  regulated entity. He's just an individual. Now, if it turns out that he was selling while he was [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2249.76s)]
*  posting this stuff and trying to manipulate the market in some way, obviously, they could find [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2255.6000000000004s)]
*  issue with that. But just for him being a credible influencer, and creating momentum [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2260.88s)]
*  for an underlying position, that in and of itself is not illegal. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2271.44s)]
*  Sacks, I think we have to go to Judge Sacks here. Judge Sacks, what is your verdict? Our [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2275.84s)]
*  meme stock manipulation, Judge Sacks. No, I don't see any manipulation there. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2279.76s)]
*  I like Jamal Settis is posting a meme. Not guilty. What I see in that clip is Jim Cramer trying to [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2284.32s)]
*  stir up an SEC investigation of Keith Gill. For what? I mean, what exactly has he done here? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2290.4s)]
*  This is kind of- The Wall Street Journal as well. If you look at the Wall Street Journal today, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2297.28s)]
*  there's an entire article basically with the headline, is what Keith Gill is doing illegal. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2300.72s)]
*  I think you can view this in a different lens, which is here is an individual that is totally [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2306.9599999999996s)]
*  outside of the establishment that, however he's done it, has gotten a hold of hundreds of millions [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2312.3199999999997s)]
*  of dollars, maybe even now billions if the stock keeps going. I think that that, for the [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2318.16s)]
*  establishment that controls those pipes, very disconcerting. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2324.64s)]
*  Right. If he was one of those apex predators on Wall Street, if he was one of those major hedge [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2330.72s)]
*  funds that donates a lot of money to the political elite, in other words, if he was a well-connected [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2336.32s)]
*  political player, I doubt anyone would be asking these questions. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2341.92s)]
*  Friberg, you got thoughts on this? Market manipulation or meme stonk fun, good times, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2346.08s)]
*  you're buying GameStop, you're buying AMC, like buyer beware, you're in on the joke. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2352.88s)]
*  What are your thoughts? Nick, can you pull up the image? I'm going to talk about the stupidity of [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2359.04s)]
*  buying the stock of this company at this valuation. This is a company, and then I think we can talk [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2362.88s)]
*  about whether that's even relevant, which I think the indication is that it's not. GameStop [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2369.6800000000003s)]
*  finished the year, 2023 fiscal year with sales of 5.3 billion down from 5.9 billion the year before. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2376.08s)]
*  So sales declined by 12% in the year. They have $5 billion in revenue selling games? [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2389.52s)]
*  Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $65 million and they have about $1.2 billion in cash. Currently, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2395.36s)]
*  as of today, the market cap is about $13.5 billion. So that makes it about a $12.5 billion [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2402.24s)]
*  enterprise value. $12.5 billion divided by $65 million of EBITDA means that this stock [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2409.4399999999996s)]
*  is currently trading at about 192 times EBITDA. A business that is profitable, and you can say [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2416.7999999999997s)]
*  that the profits are stable and predictable and is likely not going to grow very much, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2422.7999999999997s)]
*  will typically trade for 7 to 12 times EBITDA. And the stock is trading at 192 times EBITDA, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2426.96s)]
*  and the revenue is declining 12% a year. So I'll just point out, I don't think that there's [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2432.2400000000002s)]
*  anything about the actual performance of the underlying business and the security that you [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2437.92s)]
*  are buying or selling when you are making a decision about whether or not to buy or sell [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2442.08s)]
*  the security. And I think that that's the real question. Does that even matter? Clearly, it [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2445.68s)]
*  doesn't. Let people have fun. Let them go to Vegas. Let them play in the roulette table. They know what [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2450.32s)]
*  they're getting into. The disclosures are all there. All the SEC filings are there. All the [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2456.0s)]
*  financials of this business are there. What you're actually buying is publicly viewable. You can look [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2460.4s)]
*  at it. You can make an investment decision as an individual investor and trader. And you want to [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2465.12s)]
*  blow your money trying to see when the social trends are going to shift one way or another. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2470.56s)]
*  Let it be your decision. I think this is well said. If you're buying NFTs, if you're buying [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2474.96s)]
*  stonks like this, if you're playing poker in a, if you're playing bomb plots, look it up, folks, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2481.12s)]
*  if you don't know what bomb plots are, and you're going crazy playing bomb pots for eight hours, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2486.08s)]
*  like we did the other week, you're there to gamble. If you are playing bomb pots, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2490.3199999999997s)]
*  this is the bomb pots of the stock market, have fun, go crazy. If you're buying NFTs, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2495.68s)]
*  if you're buying crypto and the latest token, you know what you're getting into. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2501.3599999999997s)]
*  There's no law that defines why you should or should not buy a security with respect to the [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2506.8s)]
*  diligence you have individually done to determine whether the underlying business is worth the price [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2512.32s)]
*  you're paying. The law says that the businesses that are listing their securities for public [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2517.52s)]
*  trading have an obligation to make disclosures on their financials and any other material events to [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2522.8s)]
*  the public. And they do that through the SEC filing process. That's all out there. And then [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2527.04s)]
*  what you as an individual do with it is up to you. Enough with the nanny state. Go ahead, Sachs. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2531.28s)]
*  So when's the right time to put a short on this company? [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2536.08s)]
*  The stock is up 40% today. And then there's these reports that came out yesterday on a bunch of [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2542.56s)]
*  very big hedge funds that put very big short positions yesterday on the stock and it's up 40% [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2547.28s)]
*  today. So we're going to get margin calls. So this is where you see the same thing that happened last [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2552.8s)]
*  time where, what was that guy's name? The capital, Melvin. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2556.4s)]
*  Someone's going to get blown out on the wrong side of the street. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2566.56s)]
*  You're going to get plotkin'd. You're about to get plotkin'd. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2568.32s)]
*  Don't get plotkin'd in a Saramucci. That's what you don't want to do because you could lose it all [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2573.2000000000003s)]
*  in a Sacra Mucci or two. It's basically a game where the Redditors are, they bid up the stock [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2578.64s)]
*  to levels that realistically it's not worth that much. It basically creates a short squeeze. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2586.2400000000002s)]
*  The stock flies up. Then the hedge funds know it's overvalued. So they put new shorts on. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2593.12s)]
*  And then they do the next short squeeze. And they'll do something that's even more [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2600.08s)]
*  dangerous, which is they can get synthetically short. So they'll add leverage to this using all [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2603.28s)]
*  kinds of esoteric derivatives that other banks on Wall Street will happily sell them. And then when [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2609.28s)]
*  those are disclosed, then the Redditors can just pump it even more, which causes massive margin [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2614.2400000000002s)]
*  calls. So I think the thing that, Freebird, you're saying though, this is this existential [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2619.36s)]
*  thing that comes back. It's happened in NFTs. It's happened in the dot com bubble. It happened in [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2623.6s)]
*  SPACs. It's happened in crypto. Are we supposed to protect people? And then the question is, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2628.08s)]
*  who is the we? And are you supposed to say, if you're an adult and you can read, then read [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2634.7200000000003s)]
*  the disclosures and you're on your own? That's what the SEC says. And that's what the rule of [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2640.88s)]
*  law has been. And so this is going to be an interesting test because instead of an organization, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2645.52s)]
*  it's going to be a person, in this case, Keith Gill, who will be the face of what happens to [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2650.56s)]
*  the stock, because if a bunch of people all of a sudden plow into this thing, and then it goes to [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2655.28s)]
*  five, it'll be really interesting to see the reaction. Hey, you should have saved us. How [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2659.7599999999998s)]
*  could this happen? You know, he dumped this on all of us. And the answer is no, he did not. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2664.64s)]
*  Where was the government to save our day? Where was the government to protect consumers? [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2669.28s)]
*  Yeah, enough with the nanny state. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2672.64s)]
*  That's the next cycle of this story. The next cycle of the story is no, that government did. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2674.24s)]
*  Yeah. And you showed how the government protected everybody, which was you showed the revenue [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2678.08s)]
*  and the profits and the margins, which is publicly available. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2682.56s)]
*  And you did it in two minutes. I mean, anybody, anybody can look at your analysis and see. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2685.6s)]
*  You didn't even use a sophisticated model. You used probably the calculator app on your freaking [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2691.2799999999997s)]
*  Mac to figure out that it was 192 times. No, I'm sure he used the calculator app. So you [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2695.4399999999996s)]
*  have the Casio. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2704.8799999999997s)]
*  The whole point is you can figure out that there's no logical justification for this company [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2706.08s)]
*  using one Google search and the calculator app on your Mac. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2710.24s)]
*  Yeah. It's on you. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2714.24s)]
*  I think the question is, should we make all sports betting legal and all online casinos legal? So [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2716.0s)]
*  if you follow this to its natural conclusion, let people do what they want. Why are all of [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2720.8799999999997s)]
*  the other gambling industries so tightly regulated? And why do we protect consumers? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2725.2799999999997s)]
*  I think there's a big difference. Well, because we need a stock market. We need the ability for [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2729.7599999999998s)]
*  companies to go public. It just so happens that you can get this weird effect where some stocks [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2733.76s)]
*  can become meme stocks. But that doesn't mean you want to design the entire system of securities [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2739.36s)]
*  laws around one or two meme stocks. The fact of the matter is that investors are sufficiently [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2746.96s)]
*  protected by robust disclosure requirements that apparently GameStop has followed. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2753.5200000000004s)]
*  All that information is out there. You basically dismantled the company in like two minutes. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2760.16s)]
*  So anyone watching this show has all the information they need not to buy this stock [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2765.12s)]
*  at 190 times earnings, if they choose to follow that information. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2770.16s)]
*  The other thing that you're saying, which is really important is you have to remember what [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2776.56s)]
*  the capital markets and the stock market is there for. It's not meant for this. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2779.7599999999998s)]
*  This is a small little cul-de-sac, but the overwhelming majority of the capital markets [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2783.52s)]
*  and the equity markets is to allocate excess capital to good ideas. That's what is usually [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2788.56s)]
*  happening. There's a bunch of us that will put a bunch of our money into things because we think [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2793.84s)]
*  it's the right thing to do. And that is the overwhelming majority of what is happening in [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2799.44s)]
*  the stock market every day. And David's right. Every now and then one of these things randomly [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2804.16s)]
*  comes up. And every period of time, there'll be a few parts of the market that go crazy. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2807.84s)]
*  But the reality is that's not what the overwhelming majority of the actions. And that's not why the [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2814.3199999999997s)]
*  security cells are there. Have you guys seen this guy? His name is Tim Nackie on Instagram. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2818.7999999999997s)]
*  So what this guy did, this guy's incredible. So this guy went out and he basically bet 10 cents [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2823.68s)]
*  in online blackjack because he's legally allowed to do it where he lives. I think he's in Australia [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2830.3199999999997s)]
*  or something. Oh yeah. That's 10 cents for every follower he has on Instagram. So over the last [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2833.9199999999996s)]
*  couple of months, he's been wrecked. Yeah. He's been wrecked, racking and racking up the bets. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2838.3999999999996s)]
*  And he ended up doing these $100,000 plus bets because he got over a million followers. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2842.4s)]
*  He ran this thing up to over a million bucks and he quit. But now he's formed a blackjack syndicate. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2846.56s)]
*  So everyone wants to kind of pile in and bet with him. I think that there is this really interesting [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2851.44s)]
*  phenomenon of social betting. Everyone wants to be in a group together. He's got hundreds of thousands [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2855.6000000000004s)]
*  of people that have put money in. This is so great. And then he goes and does this online game. Nick, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2860.4s)]
*  pull the video up. I just say you. Watch how this guy does it. And he's so entertaining. He's awesome. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2864.0800000000004s)]
*  Oh man. This could be deadly for Sachs. Sachs didn't know about this. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2867.6000000000004s)]
*  72 going to blackjack and betting 10 cents for every Instagram follower I've got. There are 940,000 [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2871.2s)]
*  of you weapons with us now. So a $94,000 bet coming right up. All righty, ladies and gentlemen, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2877.3599999999997s)]
*  we have a $94,000 hand going on the line. Give us a king. King. For the 940,000 of you weapons with [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2883.04s)]
*  us. 90 on the button. Come on, Nick. 2K. Each of the side bets this bloke definitely gloves up both [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2890.0s)]
*  hands on the golf course. Never has a blackjack hand stood down such an impact on my life. I'm [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2894.3199999999997s)]
*  not healthy. Four is gross. Seven versus six. That might be a double down. That might be a double down. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2899.12s)]
*  What are we doing, Sachs? Are we doubling down, Sachs? What are we doing? I'll take three. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2906.48s)]
*  That's a double down. Double down. That's a double down. Yeah. Definitely double down. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2909.8399999999997s)]
*  God damn you. Go 10 for me here. Course, we're counting cards. 818. We'll take the 18. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2914.56s)]
*  Oh my God. 18. 18 versus six. Let's go. Get it. And go to these punting lords. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2918.64s)]
*  A glorious day with the 10-10 on. Can I get the job done again? That'll do. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2924.16s)]
*  That's what it's going to be. Go. You little **** game beauty. I will see you tomorrow, you [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2929.7599999999998s)]
*  smug son of a ****. Oh my God. This is so great. This guy is so good. Sachs, do you know about this? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2939.04s)]
*  That's some serious degeneracy. It looks so fun though. Look at Sachs. All in, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2945.44s)]
*  syndicate. Let's go. Let's back size. One hand a day. There's only one a day. Oh my God. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2950.64s)]
*  And every day his follower count goes up. So every day he bets more and then you're following. And [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2955.92s)]
*  he ran this thing up to a million in profit. Oh, so good. I haven't seen Sachs this awake during [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2960.08s)]
*  the pod. You don't get the 10 cents. He keeps it from him. He started this just by betting his own [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2964.56s)]
*  money and he would put 10 cents down every day for how many followers he had. And so he started [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2969.04s)]
*  betting more and more of his own money. And now he's got a follower count that he can monetize. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2973.8399999999997s)]
*  Is it still all of his money that he's betting? So then as of a few weeks ago, or like two weeks [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2977.52s)]
*  ago, he stopped betting his own money. He took the million off the table. He called it a day and he [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2982.0s)]
*  set up a syndicate and now people send their own money in and he's betting the syndicate's money. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2985.52s)]
*  And he does one hand a day and he keeps racking this thing up. It's just, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2991.04s)]
*  what happens when he loses? Is there a day where he's lost a lot of money? Oh, dude, you gotta watch [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=2995.12s)]
*  it. I want to see what happens when he loses. Can we hit this guy at the all in summit? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3000.32s)]
*  He plays online blackjack, right? So there's always like a fake dealer and he has all this [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3004.7200000000003s)]
*  hilarious commentary on the fake dealer. Look at Sachs, Sachs is texting people to set up an [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3009.84s)]
*  accountant and a VPN right now. I'll be honest with you. This may get me back on Instagram. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3013.36s)]
*  This is so juicy. We should get this guy out to the summit. This guy's got to come to the [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3018.88s)]
*  summit and do a live hand with MrBeast. Big shout out. Is he on TikTok or no? I think he only does [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3023.6000000000004s)]
*  Insta. Yeah. Timnack. I haven't seen Sachs listen to Freberg on this podcast more than he just did. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3028.72s)]
*  That was incredible. You got Sachs' attention. Sachs, did you know you could play live online [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3034.7999999999997s)]
*  blackjack from your phone? Did you know this? Did I know that? This is important information [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3040.08s)]
*  for all of us. Big day coming up. There is 514,000 of you in here now and a $51,400 bet coming up. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3046.16s)]
*  All right, day 60. A monumental day. We can hit the 50k button here. We will do $50,000 on the [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3053.44s)]
*  button. Let's go, let's go. $800 on the 21 plus three. $600 on the perfect peers. Come on. This is [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3060.64s)]
*  by far and away. Look at Sachs. The biggest bet I have put on a table in my life. We're trying to [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3067.44s)]
*  itch ourselves into gambling immortality. 14 plays 3. No. Oh, it's a disgusting pull on day 60 with [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3072.16s)]
*  all the marbles on the line. We will stand and look for 10, 10 and bust. 10, 10 and bust. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3081.68s)]
*  10, 10 and bust. Come on. 10, 10, 10. To be hero again. King, king, king. Yes, yes, yes. Day 60. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3088.16s)]
*  Stick that in your pipe and smoke it. Holy s***. We pulled it off. Oh my god. We've broken the push [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3096.16s)]

*  and I'll be bidding even more. This guy's got great energy. Can he do one live on the show next [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3109.6s)]
*  week? Oh, day 55. Oh, here we go. This is from Instagram follower I've got outrageously. There [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3114.56s)]
*  is an extra 21,000 of you in here today. So $37,600 bet going on for the 376,000 of you legends in [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3119.44s)]
*  here now. Coming right up. Okay. Day 55 brings about a big god damn bet. We have $36,000 on the [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3126.96s)]
*  button. $1000 on the 21 plus three and $600 on the perfect pairs. 37.6k total. Bets are closed. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3134.96s)]
*  We've just had a god damn dealer change. We've been duped here. I'm calling the commissioner. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3143.2s)]
*  I don't like the dealer. I don't like the dealer. Playsay. Oh, 12 v king. Oh my god. Before I hit [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3147.52s)]
*  the hit button, I will say this. Having talked to the morning rumble this morning, last time I spoke [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3156.2400000000002s)]
*  to the media about this journey, I broke a six day winning streak that day and I lost. So if it [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3161.36s)]
*  happens again today, this one's on Roger Farrelly. We need to see eight or nine go low. No. Oh my god. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3166.1600000000003s)]
*  Come on. That dealer change was so dirty. I guess you just can't win them all. But we've been on [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3174.0s)]
*  some run and I will see you tomorrow when we'll be bidding even more. That dealer change was so [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3180.0s)]
*  dirty. You saw the dealer change at the last minute. He came up and they changed the dealer. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3185.52s)]
*  To me before I've been with you and they do that every time with you. When you start running it up, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3189.8399999999997s)]
*  they send in the dealer to ice you. I think there's a particular dealer they've got, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3195.12s)]
*  you know, it's like in the bullpen, the blank cooler. Yeah, we know the one, the blank cooler. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3199.12s)]
*  I don't want to say anything, but it's the cooler. We need this guy next week on the pod to do the [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3205.12s)]
*  live bet. And then we each give him 5k. How about that? You guys in? I've had them trot out the [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3209.68s)]
*  cooler. When I was playing craps once, I was so mad and I was on such a heater. And what happens [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3214.24s)]
*  is you guys have seen me play craps where it's like, it's all rhythm, right? So it's like, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3221.8399999999997s)]
*  I get the dice in a certain way. Yeah. You know, I do that. Yeah. And they bring in this guy and he [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3226.16s)]
*  was like a klutz. It's like Daniel Day Lewis in my left foot. All of a sudden he's, everything is [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3231.9199999999996s)]
*  spilling over. Four dice fall off the table. I got so out of rhythm. I cracked up the floor. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3236.64s)]
*  It was so, I was so mad. I want this guy on the pod next week. We're each putting five dimes in. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3242.96s)]
*  We got 20k from all in. Let's do it. That would be so much. Oh my God. We should get him to play [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3247.28s)]
*  a special all in hand and let him run up our capital on the summit. Let's take profits from [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3252.64s)]
*  the summit and do a live hand. We could put like a million bucks each on it. We double up and then [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3257.84s)]
*  we're done with the pod. We don't have to do a summit next year. Really good idea. Let's do it. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3262.56s)]
*  Let's let it roll. All right. God, and this is so much action for us. I don't know if we can [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3266.96s)]
*  continue, but there's more stories to come and just buyer beware. I mean, if you're betting on [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3272.4s)]
*  this stuff, I mean, what do we have to tell you if you're betting on game stop? No, we don't have [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3277.84s)]
*  to tell you anything. You're an adult. You're an adult. Go to your own job. Well, here's something [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3281.76s)]
*  really interesting. Put on your seatbelt, try to drink and drive. Don't use drugs. I mean, it's [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3286.48s)]
*  like all of a sudden, like we need to govern how you're not functioning adult. By the way, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3292.96s)]
*  if you swim in Cape Cod alone in the deep water and the kelp edge, you might get hit by a great [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3298.24s)]
*  white shark. Or do whatever you want and please just take responsibility for yourself because [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3303.04s)]
*  it's not our job. I'm responsible for my children, not you. Well, I mean, also, I just want to ask [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3306.7999999999997s)]
*  one question here. Is there anything with the short selling that could, there could be more [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3313.2s)]
*  disclosure on that, Shamoff, just if the SEC was going to do something? I hear that bubble up once [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3316.4799999999996s)]
*  in a while. Should short sellers be more disclosed? I really think that's a very good idea. I do think [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3321.04s)]
*  that there are some short sellers who are doing it because they have to hedge a position that they [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3325.76s)]
*  have. But then there are other short sellers who are doing it speculatively. And there are synthetic [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3330.1600000000003s)]
*  instruments that banks will sell you to go massively super short. That's how you can get a situation [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3334.8s)]
*  where 140% of the stock is sold short, which shouldn't make sense. If there's only a hundred [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3340.48s)]
*  shares of a company, how could it be that 140 shares are sold short? It's because you can have [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3345.76s)]
*  these synthetic derivatives. Explain synthetic for the audience because I don't think people know [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3349.92s)]
*  this concept. So there are ways where if you have a formal trading relationship with Wall Street, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3352.96s)]
*  and you need to be of a certain size and they go through a diligence process, they give you, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3360.32s)]
*  so you know, I have one called an ISDA. And it's essentially an account and a framework that you [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3364.8s)]
*  negotiate with a bank that allows you to call them and say, hey, give me a B or C. And other times, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3370.0s)]
*  they'll call you and say, hey, I have this really interesting way to play XYZ. And one of the things [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3376.4s)]
*  that you can do with them is you can say, listen, I want to go super, super long or super, super short, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3382.48s)]
*  a theme or a company, and they'll create a contract between you and them that'll allow you [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3388.96s)]
*  to get that kind of exposure. Now, you're not supposed to do that on a regular basis, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3396.64s)]
*  nor are you supposed to lever this up. This is actually what blew up a different hedge fund [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3402.48s)]
*  called Archegos. I remember we covered it. And in that, I guess what happened was, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3407.12s)]
*  the gentleman was calling many banks and doing all these things. And one bank didn't know what the [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3412.9599999999996s)]
*  other bank was doing. So all of a sudden, there was this massive, synthetic leverage that he was [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3418.0s)]
*  getting on, I think it was News Corp stock. And then they found out that it was unwound, then he [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3423.2799999999997s)]
*  owed a bunch of money, he couldn't pay it, the whole thing shut down, the stock market went crazy. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3427.8399999999997s)]
*  So there does need to be that disclosure, but there isn't a rule that says that. And every time [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3432.48s)]
*  somebody tries to introduce it, the broker dealers basically lobby and kill it. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3436.4s)]
*  So in a way, it's almost like a parallel universe where bets are occurring on outcomes in the stock [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3441.36s)]
*  market that are not tied to the stocks in the stock market. Well, it is tied in the sense that [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3447.04s)]
*  ultimately, it all needs to feed back to an actual physical share. And so this is where all this [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3451.68s)]
*  price behavior gets further amplified. I think the point is that these forms of expressing risk, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3456.8s)]
*  yes, can really amplify what would otherwise happen. So in free birds example, most people [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3461.52s)]
*  would sit there get the financials. Some would maybe say historically, this thing looks like a [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3466.88s)]
*  short or I wouldn't even buy it at all. Right. But other people may say, well, if I listen to [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3472.56s)]
*  the chairman, and I think about the future, maybe I go long. That's a, that's a fine thing, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3477.36s)]
*  you can enter the stock market and do that. But all this other stuff amplifies all these things [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3481.84s)]
*  to a degree that we're not really used to. And let's be honest, the people who are betting, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3486.0s)]
*  I'll use the word betting here, the people who are betting on these things are not looking to [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3491.2s)]
*  get a 7% return or beat the average. I mean, they're looking to double their money in 48 hours, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3495.04s)]
*  they know what they're getting in for. They're just walking up to the roulette table and putting [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3500.8799999999997s)]
*  10k on black or red, and then clapping and seeing five reds in a row and saying, Oh, it's got to be [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3504.24s)]
*  black next. I mean, they're Phil Helm with thing this with they don't say that when they lose them. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3510.0s)]
*  No, of course not. Yeah, no, no personal ownership here. Well, here's an interesting thing that's [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3514.3199999999997s)]
*  sort of related. A little bit of jurisdiction shopping or placing of companies and products [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3517.76s)]
*  continues in Texas is very hot in this regard. BlackRock and Citadel are backing new stock, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3525.5200000000004s)]
*  a new stock exchange take on the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ duopoly. So according to [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3530.8s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal, the exchange would be based in Texas and called the Texas Stock Exchange [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3536.2400000000002s)]
*  or the TXSE. They've raised 120 million so far, it seems like a low number. And the general pitch [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3540.0s)]
*  here is the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ have become expensive and they've been increasing [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3545.92s)]
*  their compliance costs. NASDAQ has a new board of diversity target that went into effect at the [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3552.48s)]
*  start of this year, all the DEI stuff. And so this exchange is pitching itself as a CEO friendly, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3557.52s)]
*  and the anti woke exchange. So here's the plan timeline file and SEC registration box later this [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3563.44s)]
*  year start facilitating trades next year, host the first new listing in 2026. Interesting, I guess [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3569.04s)]
*  that Citadel and BlackRock are in this group because they could bring a lot of business, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3574.96s)]
*  obviously. And you know, some of this other stuff that's been going on with Texas, Texas is now [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3578.96s)]
*  Tesla's corporate headquarters. They moved to from Palo Alto in California to Texas in 2021. Your [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3583.84s)]
*  thoughts here, Chamath on moving? Love it. Okay, why? Why do you love it so much? Tell them. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3589.76s)]
*  Competition. I do think that it's hard right now for companies to get access to capital. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3595.44s)]
*  I think more diverse and more flexible ways where smart investors can allocate their money into the [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3603.44s)]
*  ideas that they want are better. I think that the duopoly hasn't created enough competition. So the [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3611.28s)]
*  NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange haven't innovated. And in fact, they've probably been [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3617.76s)]
*  a little regressive in terms of filing requirements, listing requirements, in terms of [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3623.44s)]
*  board composition. They've fallen for a bunch of things that don't actually point to the economic [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3629.04s)]
*  rationale or value in a company. And so I think if you have a third player, there's a chance that [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3636.32s)]
*  more competition will create more rational behavior, which will flow into the companies themselves. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3642.24s)]
*  So I'm a huge fan of this. I think that the stock exchanges right now are too brittle. And that [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3648.8s)]
*  large reason is because there's only two of them. Freeburg, any thoughts for you about more [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3655.84s)]
*  options? Well, I think part of this is actually there's been these rules imposed by [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3660.6400000000003s)]
*  NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange that have tried to enforce upon the listed companies, [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3668.56s)]
*  rules and regulations that are not tied to securities laws, including some of these aspects [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3676.6400000000003s)]
*  of diversity of your board. And I know that there have been a lot of public company, board members, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3682.72s)]
*  and CEOs that have quietly tried to push back on these rules, that they're imposing social systems [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3688.9599999999996s)]
*  upon what is effectively a regulated exchange. And so there's certainly an interest and a pushing for [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3695.8399999999997s)]
*  a competitive marketplace for exchanges. There was a survey done recently that showed, I got to find [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3701.8399999999997s)]
*  some of this data, but it showed the cost of going public on NASDAQ, AMEX, and the New York [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3707.2s)]
*  Stock Exchange was about $7.4 million. Cost of going public through an over-the-counter bulletin [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3712.72s)]
*  board listing service was about $2 million. And then there's these additional kind of rules that [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3718.3199999999997s)]
*  are being imposed if you want to be listed on the big boards. So clearly there's interest and it's [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3723.4399999999996s)]
*  great to see a competitive market emerge. By the way, there have been other attempts. There's that [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3728.0s)]
*  long-term stock exchange. You guys remember that a couple of years ago? That was kind of [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3733.76s)]
*  long-term holdings. There was two other equity security exchanges efforts made in the last [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3738.4s)]
*  couple of years that didn't take off. So this isn't super novel in terms of like seeing a new [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3744.1600000000003s)]
*  challenger exchange step up, but I think more competition is always better. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3749.2000000000003s)]
*  All right. In other news, Apple and OpenAI have reportedly struck an iPhone deal. According to [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3754.32s)]
*  Bloomberg, Apple is going to announce a major partnership with OpenAI at WWDC next week. Chat [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3759.28s)]
*  GPT will be integrated into iOS, which means Apple is outsourcing its AI chat bot, at least at the [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3763.6800000000003s)]
*  start. I guess you could argue it benefits both sides because OpenAI gets access to over a billion [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3769.84s)]
*  phone users and Apple gets a native integration of a top tier language model. Terms are not clear, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3775.36s)]
*  but most people think this is going to be a short to midterm deal with Apple building out its own AI [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3782.2400000000002s)]
*  chat bot in the future, but it's just not ready for prime time right now. Also plans to make Siri [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3787.76s)]
*  AI powered and bring AI features to the Apple ecosystem. You may have heard that Apple is going [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3792.1600000000003s)]
*  to try to let Siri dive deeper into apps. I.e. if you're ordering your DoorDash or Uber Eats or an [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3797.0400000000004s)]
*  Uber or Lyft or whatever, it might actually be able to execute those things inside of an app. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3803.76s)]
*  Interesting line from the article, Apple executives were concerned about reputational [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3809.84s)]
*  damage from a rogue chat bot. Some people within Apple have a philosophical aversion to having a [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3813.52s)]
*  chat bot at all. Very interesting. So thoughts on this sax, just getting you back in the loop here. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3819.12s)]
*  Pete Slauson Well, we kind of predicted that something like this could or should happen. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3827.2s)]
*  We said that the big win for Apple in AI would be to make Siri actually work based on an LLM, [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3831.6s)]
*  because Siri just, you know, its understanding of languages historically has not been great, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3839.12s)]
*  and that's really limited the usefulness of it. Imagine if Siri worked with the conversational [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3843.7599999999998s)]
*  abilities of chat GPT-4. If it had that level of semantic understanding, if it could talk to you [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3849.6s)]
*  the way that 4.0 can talk to you, that would make Siri really powerful. And you know, for me, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3855.44s)]
*  Siri is a feature I've turned off because it's so annoying. But- [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3861.68s)]
*  Sucks, right? It never works. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3864.72s)]
*  Pete Slauson If you give it the power of the best open AI model, and then the speed of running it [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3866.3999999999996s)]
*  natively on the iPhone. I don't know what they're going to do about that, but presumably there are [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3873.4399999999996s)]
*  things they can do to speed it up. And then you give it access to the internal APIs you're using [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3876.8799999999997s)]
*  to control apps. That would be really powerful because now Siri could be an agent that you can [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3883.68s)]
*  just tell it to do things. And you know, not just ask like the weather and the time and set alarms. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3889.52s)]
*  Aaron Powell Well, what's really interesting, I think, about this deal Chamath is Apple is [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3894.64s)]
*  having a hard time getting people to upgrade their phones, right? And people have lost faith in the [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3899.6s)]
*  stock. Now you say, Hey, we're going to put a language model on here. You can make it a local [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3903.92s)]
*  language model and have it be privacy protected. So that means you need more memory on the phone. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3908.88s)]
*  You're going to need another chip on the phone. It's going to, there's a distinct reason to upgrade [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3914.48s)]
*  now. If you had a language model on your phone, and Siri was like this super Siri that actually [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3918.88s)]
*  got stuff done, I would upgrade my phone immediately. And right now I skipped two or three [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3924.4s)]
*  generations. What are your thoughts on this as a way to maybe reinvigorate the iPhone franchise? [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3928.88s)]
*  Chamath, you buy it or not? Chamath Prakash No, the problem is that we don't know what the right form [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3933.6800000000003s)]
*  factor for a superscaled consumer AI app looks like. So we've all again, I'm not trying to be a [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3939.12s)]
*  wet blanket. It's just that when you look at what's built so far, I think most of the things we've seen [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3947.44s)]
*  are the Friendster and MySpaces of this class of app. We haven't seen the Facebooks and the [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3953.6s)]
*  Instagrams yet. And the reason is because we haven't experimented and pushed the boundaries [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3962.16s)]
*  of the form factor. So for example, in the first phases of social networking, [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3968.16s)]
*  the idea that you would collect information about all your friends and then create something called [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3973.44s)]
*  a newsfeed was totally shocking. And I remember when we first released that people got really [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3977.84s)]
*  upset. And then it just became this de facto. Why were they upset about it? Tell me. Well, [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3983.84s)]
*  it's this idea that you collected this information and then you presented it about all of your [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3988.88s)]
*  friends was disconcerting initially as a feature. Now, if you don't have a newsfeed of some kind in [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3992.8s)]
*  your app, for many apps, it's DOA, right? So the same problem exists today. All we've done today [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=3997.6s)]
*  is we've replicated an existing use case with a slightly better feature here or there. Nobody has [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4003.68s)]
*  gone out and said on a blank canvas, let me completely reimagine how consumers want value [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4011.52s)]
*  with these things to enable it. And until that happens, we're just wasting time. So the idea [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4019.36s)]
*  that Apple with this thousand dollar device is all of a sudden going to figure out that this is [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4024.72s)]
*  why you're going to upgrade, I think is pretty speculative. And I think they're going to be [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4028.3999999999996s)]
*  disappointed. I think people have realized that four generations ago was more than enough. And [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4032.9599999999996s)]
*  on top of this, the stuff that you value inside the iPhone is not what you're going to need for AI. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4039.9199999999996s)]
*  So actually, you know, spending a trillion billion dollars on the fourth camera lens, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4047.2799999999997s)]
*  the fourth camera lens is not going to be what solves this problem. And so you're more likely [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4052.72s)]
*  to have a very simple earbud that is, you know, very inconspicuous and discreetly in your inner [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4060.72s)]
*  ear well, speaking information to you, then you are and with a companion $500 phone, then I think [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4066.24s)]
*  you will be with a $1,500 iPhone. You're in the new form factor. I'm going to take the other side [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4072.96s)]
*  of the camp. I think that because you have this data on your phone, all your iMessages, all your [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4077.52s)]
*  documents, all your photos, videos, music collection, there's a unique set of data on [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4082.4s)]
*  that phone to make your personal LLM. That's going to do extraordinary things for you because it's [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4086.8s)]
*  going to watch you and all your behavior on that phone. And man, if I can have a personal LLM, [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4090.88s)]
*  that's been watching me order very specific sushi rolls, or, you know, where I send my Ubers, what [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4095.52s)]
*  type of Ubers I like, what music I play, I feel like that LLM don't need my point is you don't [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4100.64s)]
*  need a $1,500 device to do that. So if you spend $1,500, so cool. Don't you agree that [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4106.32s)]
*  Uber has the data door dash has the data. No, you're missing my point. The data of me clicking on [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4113.36s)]
*  the screen that is not apples to collect. It's not there. I think they'll collect it, put it in there. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4118.48s)]
*  You would have to fundamentally change the SDK. The idea then that Apple can take a tax on that [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4124.4s)]
*  is outrageous. I think the whole app economy would blow up if Apple tried to do that. I think it's [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4129.679999999999s)]
*  the opposite. I think the app economy would thrive. You'd be have this a great thing where [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4135.04s)]
*  I could tell it order the same thing I ordered on door. I encourage Apple to try to change the [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4137.759999999999s)]
*  terms of service and see what happens. Okay, freeburg your thoughts on this. Any thoughts? [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4141.12s)]
*  No. Okay, well, let's get to this. It's time for science corner temperatures in the Atlantic [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4145.44s)]
*  Ocean are alarmingly high. Freeburg, a couple of weeks ago, we saw this crazy chart on the X [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4149.84s)]
*  about the Atlantic Ocean temperatures. pre hurricane Katrina right about now and take us [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4155.44s)]
*  through this because it's very disconcerting. There's not much to talk about except to highlight [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4161.68s)]
*  this image which shows again, we talked about this a few months ago, hot ocean temperatures [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4168.08s)]
*  drive hurricane and tropical storm activity because as the wind, the air above the ocean starts to [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4174.48s)]
*  move, the energy from the ocean gets pulled out, you know, like things cool down, the water cools [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4180.64s)]
*  down, but that energy actually goes back into pushing the wind to move faster and faster. And [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4186.96s)]
*  that's how tropical storms, cyclones, and hurricanes are formed is warm ocean temperatures. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4192.24s)]
*  And there's been this kind of persistent warming since last year in the Atlantic, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4199.12s)]
*  in this particular region, where all the hurricanes form. And normally the hurricane [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4205.2s)]
*  season starts kind of call it August to October. Right now we are seeing temperatures that are so [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4210.24s)]
*  far beyond what we've seen. Anytime historically, this image that you're looking at here actually [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4216.0s)]
*  compares the ocean temperatures right now in the Atlantic to where we were at the same time period [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4221.76s)]
*  in 2005, which was a record hurricane year, obviously with her crazy tree now, right? Yeah. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4226.88s)]
*  And so their national hurricane center, a lot of the climatologists are forecasting [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4233.280000000001s)]
*  that over the next couple of months, we could see and should expect to see probabilistically, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4237.76s)]
*  much larger, stronger, bigger, more frequent hurricanes than we've ever seen historically. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4242.96s)]
*  So we'll see if it plays out. Just a very small tidbit of news to share thought it'd be worth [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4247.68s)]
*  highlighting, not getting a lot of mainstream media press attention, but certainly- [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4252.0s)]
*  Let me ask you to just confirm a couple of things for me, because we live in a time where people [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4256.240000000001s)]
*  are questioning science and scientists, and we have institutions we don't trust, whether it's [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4260.88s)]
*  free letter agencies in Washington or scientists and all these papers being written and everything [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4266.8s)]
*  we're finding out and nobody trusts anybody. And we're sort of resetting trust. I want to just [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4271.04s)]
*  ask you as somebody I trust as a scientist, number one, global warming, temperatures increasing, [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4276.32s)]
*  putting aside what we do about it, temperatures in the ocean, it is undeniable or increasing at [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4281.84s)]
*  a rate that you would describe as concerning. Am I correct? We have not seen in the modern era, [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4287.599999999999s)]
*  temperatures in the ocean, like we're seeing now. That's a fact, right? So I'm not going to do this [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4295.5199999999995s)]
*  whole big prognosis on everything all in one, because I think that's where people feel like [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4300.32s)]
*  there's room for discrediting things. I'm trying to atomize this. Yeah, we can be very specific [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4305.2s)]
*  about things. Here's an example. So this is the sea surface temperature going back to 1981. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4309.44s)]
*  And as you can see at this point in the year, and the temperature oscillates because of the way the [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4314.8s)]
*  earth tilts towards the sun. And so at this point in the year, we are seeing right now, [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4319.92s)]
*  sea surface temperatures that are beyond anything we've seen historically, and it is continuing to [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4326.5599999999995s)]
*  climb. So if this does not taper off or level off, we will see record sea surface temperatures [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4331.2s)]
*  in the August to October timeframe, which will almost certainly push massive hurricane events [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4338.4s)]
*  out of the Atlantic, and they will find their way towards the continental US and Mexico. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4343.679999999999s)]
*  Okay, so this is super clarifying. This should not be controversial to anybody. We have temperature [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4347.2s)]
*  readings in the ocean, and this is concerning. Just data. Simply data. It's just simply data, [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4351.28s)]
*  right? So putting aside what political party you're on and what you think about gas and oil. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4354.96s)]
*  I will tell you there's a lot of theory. One of the theories, so there's theories about El Nino, [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4359.04s)]
*  there's theories about climate change contributing to this. There's also a theory about sulfur [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4363.2s)]
*  dioxide that has now been banned in shipping and cargo vessels that go across the oceans. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4367.6s)]
*  Last year, they banned sulfur dioxide use in the fuel that's coming out of these. And sulfur [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4374.64s)]
*  dioxide actually reflects sunlight. So as it goes up into the air, into the atmosphere coming out of [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4379.84s)]
*  these ships, it actually blocks and reflects light. So that would make the oceans cooler. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4384.48s)]
*  And so a lot of folks have said that over the last couple of decades, we've actually dampened [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4389.2s)]
*  the temperature and the warming that's happened on Earth because of all the sulfur dioxide we've [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4394.64s)]
*  been putting up into the atmosphere. But because sulfur dioxide causes acid rain, [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4398.4s)]
*  environmentalists have been pushing for years to ban sulfur dioxide. The problem is with [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4402.88s)]
*  banning sulfur dioxide, you may have this other side effect, which is now more rapid increased [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4407.76s)]
*  warming of the surface and of the oceans. So these are complex systems, and we should be [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4412.48s)]
*  delicate with them. If you were to give us a prescription here, Freiburg, what's like a basic [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4418.64s)]
*  prescription? Are we just experimenting in a way that is not advisable with this ecosystem? [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4425.200000000001s)]
*  And we should just not run the experiment? I think that might be like a non-political, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4435.6s)]
*  non-charged way to say it. This experiment is a little bit too crazy to run on the one [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4440.0s)]
*  planet Earth we have. Yeah. Which experiment? [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4444.88s)]
*  The experiment of doing things that increase global warming, which would be- [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4447.52s)]
*  You mean living? Well, yeah. Burning fossil fuels- [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4452.64s)]
*  Fun experiment. People are just acting in their own economic best interests. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4456.8s)]
*  Yes. And if that economic best interest increases temperature so much, do you have a fear, [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4460.72s)]
*  Freiburg, that it will compromise the oceans and damage them to a point that would be extremely [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4466.88s)]
*  concerning? I guess what I'm getting at. There is a reduction in biodiversity that's [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4471.6s)]
*  underway. We can see that using data. But to Chamoff's point, humans have prioritized [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4475.28s)]
*  the progression of individuals forward. China had a billion people that came out of poverty in 30 [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4483.12s)]
*  years. And they came out of poverty because of the industrialization of the production of [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4488.88s)]
*  consumable goods that that population gets to consume. They get access to more calories, [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4494.4s)]
*  they get access to more foods, they get to have cars, they get to have houses, all of that making [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4498.16s)]
*  cement, making concrete, all of those things require industrial systems. And those industrial [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4502.32s)]
*  systems have a cost. That cost is the dollar economic cost, which we're rationalizing with [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4507.44s)]
*  great productivity. Then there's this whole cost that's externalized. Got it. Yeah, we understand [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4512.4s)]
*  that. Yeah, sure. So that's the tension is like, if you're wealthy, if you're a wealthy nation, [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4516.719999999999s)]
*  if you're the Western Europe or the United States, you get to stand up and say, stop carbon. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4521.679999999999s)]
*  But if you're the rest of the world, you're like, I want to have a home. I want to have a car. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4526.799999999999s)]
*  You want to have the same evolution stuff that America went through or Europe. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4530.24s)]
*  I want to progress as a person. I want to progress as a society. And that's the tension [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4535.76s)]
*  that makes us a very difficult problem to resolve, which is how to more the world get to progress [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4540.719999999999s)]
*  while being cognizant of the long term. I am deeply optimistic. So let me just say this. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4546.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah. That's what I'm getting at. Are you optimistic or are you pessimistic? Tell us. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4551.5199999999995s)]
*  I believe strongly that there is a strong relationship between the output of atmospheric [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4555.28s)]
*  carbon and the deleterious effects we see in ecosystems. That is something I feel like is [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4562.32s)]
*  true from data. I am not, however, as pessimistic that the world is going to end in the next decade [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4567.04s)]
*  or two because I see improvements in productivity, meaning how many units we get out for every unit [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4573.04s)]
*  in or how many units we get out for every unit of carbon that's emitted. And those productivity, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4579.2s)]
*  meaning better technology systems are rapidly changing how we make things and how people are [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4584.48s)]
*  accessing goods and services. And I think that that's why I am like, because I'm a techno optimist, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4589.839999999999s)]
*  I'm optimistic about where things are headed. And it is also why I get very angry and upset [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4595.04s)]
*  about any efforts or attempts to slow down the adoption of technology, because these things will [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4600.4s)]
*  pull people forward and make that happen faster without all the deleterious side effects that [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4605.28s)]
*  we've unfortunately had to do in the absence of technology. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4610.16s)]
*  So Trimoth, I'll pull you into here. So based on what Freiburg is saying here, [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4613.44s)]
*  yes, these things are occurring, but the technology and the advances we're seeing [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4617.76s)]
*  in but one example, solar, and then some people might bring up nuclear and other ones. We just [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4621.5199999999995s)]
*  had Phil Deutsch at my conference this week give a great talk on this. Solar is just getting so [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4625.2s)]
*  cheap. Batteries are getting so cheap, putting batteries in your home, putting solar in, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4631.36s)]
*  and then putting data centers next to nuclear things. This is all adding up to we can solve [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4636.24s)]
*  this problem. And so you too feel optimistic about this? [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4640.56s)]
*  Yeah, totally. I think that climate change stalled when it was an emotional and philosophical [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4643.6s)]
*  rallying cry, largely of the left. When instead it became something about resilience [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4649.6s)]
*  and domestic manufacturing, both sides came together. And I think we're at a point now where [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4657.2s)]
*  the US's energy independence plus the amount of reliance on non-carbon-based fuels will drive a [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4665.360000000001s)]
*  sea change in the United States. I think it'll be copied in Western Europe. And it's also going to [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4673.2s)]
*  be at enough of a low price point where it'll get embraced in the developing world. So it's an [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4678.24s)]
*  incredible example of if you want to take an idea and a bunch of solutions and want to die on the [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4684.88s)]
*  hill of messaging and platitudes, it'll make no progress. But if instead you're willing to sort of [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4693.84s)]
*  be less extreme about it and actually just frame it in economic value add, all of a sudden everybody [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4701.68s)]
*  embraces it and it just becomes obvious. So I think that we're going to do wonders over the next [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4709.12s)]
*  20 and 30 and 40 years all over the world to push back on the general state of warming. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4715.360000000001s)]
*  But I think it will have happened because the economic incentives aligned, not because of [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4723.04s)]
*  in a philosophical or emotional framing of the issue. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4730.719999999999s)]
*  All right, everybody. This has been a very productive episode of the number one podcast [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4733.5199999999995s)]
*  in the world, the All In Podcast. And good luck tonight, gentlemen, with your fundraiser. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4738.799999999999s)]
*  I wish you great luck. David Sachs and Chamath Palihapiti, even if it's not my preferred [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4744.24s)]
*  candidate, that's totally fine. We can all differ and you can have a great, great event tonight. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4748.4s)]
*  Good luck. I have one thing. Okay, go ahead, Chamath. I have one more birthday in my family [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4753.28s)]
*  today. Making us all look bad. This is one of the most incredible people in my life. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4758.24s)]
*  Charismatic, funny, charming, intelligent. It is my bestie David Friedberg's birthday today. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4765.28s)]
*  Oh, it is. We love you, David. We love you, David. We had a nice little birthday cake at [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4772.48s)]
*  the liquidity summit this week for him. I had a cake made. Thank you for showing. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4778.16s)]
*  Yeah. Happy birthday. And here we go. And it's also AK 47, Alan Keating's birthday today as well. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4782.24s)]
*  Oh, you guys had the same birthday. I love Alan Keating. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4788.24s)]
*  Shout out to Alan Keating. One is 45 and one is 47. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4790.4s)]
*  What? Here we go. Oh, it's karma. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4794.5599999999995s)]
*  Do you know the significance of that? Of course. He's going to win all the [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4798.799999999999s)]
*  odd number elections. And there we go. Here we go. I think it's a sign. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4802.0s)]
*  It's a sign. Listen, I wish good luck to you all tonight. I hope that it goes off well for you, [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4806.0s)]
*  for you gentlemen. And listen, I would love to have Trump on the pod. Would love to have Biden [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4811.2s)]
*  on the pod. Like all things, we just want to have a great conversation here. We keep it respectful. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4816.4s)]
*  Sometimes it gets a little chippy, but we love each other. And we love you, the audience, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4820.64s)]
*  for participating in this. Don't fall for the mainstream media's nonsense in trying to divide [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4824.4s)]
*  and conquer. We got important tasks to do and problems to solve in the world. And the way we [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4828.88s)]
*  do that is through great conversations. Hopefully we set a tone, an example for everybody else of [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4833.36s)]
*  just how to do that. We still love each other and we sometimes some elbows get flown and it's all [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4838.24s)]
*  good. Chamath, Sax, good luck tonight. Freeberg, happy birthday. And we'll see you all next time [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4843.6s)]

*  and you're doom scrolling and tweeting all night, maybe this will help you go to bed. Finally, [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwCy9hmhIE&t=4954.320000000001s)]
