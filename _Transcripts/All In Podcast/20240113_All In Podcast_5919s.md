# E161 US strikes Houthis, market instability, Q1 rate cuts in doubt, Carta's major mishap, DEI
**All In Podcast:** [January 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc)
*  Nick, can you cue the tape? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=0.0s)]
*  This is now the worst form of a shot. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1.48s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4.4s)]
*  Oh! [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5.24s)]
*  I mean, the fact that he hit the rim is a miracle. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=7.0s)]
*  The most un-athletic, what is, oh God. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  I have to, wish we could get slow motion down that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=13.24s)]
*  Oh. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=16.32s)]
*  It's like the ball, the ball is just moving forward. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=17.32s)]
*  Now look at his hand, look at the right hand, look. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=20.12s)]
*  Oh! [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=21.76s)]
*  Look at that, what is that about? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=22.6s)]
*  One hand is. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=25.44s)]
*  It's, I mean, that has nothing to do with basketball. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=27.32s)]
*  Unnatural basketball slash athletic movement I've seen. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=30.96s)]
*  Come on, wasn't that bad. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=35.92s)]
*  I mean, the lean forward too. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=39.44s)]
*  The lean forward, the kind of like sassy jump, you know, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  the sassy jump. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  What are you saying? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=46.32s)]
*  He little sashayed on the side there, it's nice. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=47.88s)]
*  Oh! [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=50.56s)]
*  All right everybody, welcome to the All In Podcast [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=51.4s)]
*  with me again, the chairman dictator Chamath Palihapitiya, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  David Freberg, the Sultan of Science, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=61.92s)]
*  and the Rain Man himself, David Sacks. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  Our first guest today is David Freberg, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=67.4s)]
*  the first man to be elected to the throne [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=69.84s)]
*  of the United States, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=72.16s)]
*  and the first man to be elected to the throne [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=73.16s)]
*  of the United States, David Freberg. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=75.52s)]
*  David Freberg, the first man to be elected to the throne [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=77.6s)]
*  of the United States, David Sacks. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=81.11999999999999s)]
*  Our first topic, we'll go to our war correspondent. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=83.44s)]
*  The US and its allies have struck Houthi targets in Yemen. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=86.56s)]
*  Sacks? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=90.6s)]
*  Well, we talked about this two weeks ago on the show, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=91.44s)]
*  and we talked about it as a escalatory risk [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  in the Middle East back then, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=96.56s)]
*  and I think that that is playing out now. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=97.6s)]
*  We fired, I don't know, maybe 100 rockets and missiles [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=101.64s)]
*  at Yemen last night. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=106.12s)]
*  We're trying to deterrence, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  and I guess try and prevent the Houthis [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=110.64s)]
*  from attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=113.52s)]
*  but that deterrence is not working. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=117.2s)]
*  I mean, there's already a new attack by the Houthis [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=119.56s)]
*  this morning of a commercial ship in the Red Sea. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=121.92s)]
*  So I don't think this is gonna have any impact [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=126.32s)]
*  other than to escalate the conflict in the Middle East [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=128.88s)]
*  and put us on a path to war with Iran, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=131.76s)]
*  which is really where the neocons wanna take us. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  You've heard, obviously, the warmongers like Lindsey Graham [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=139.32s)]
*  are calling for that, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=142.12s)]
*  but even Speaker Mike Johnson is talking about that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  I think that's where this is all headed, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=145.64s)]
*  is a larger war in the Middle East [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=147.32s)]
*  that features the US and Israel going to war with Iran. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=149.04s)]
*  I think we should all be very concerned about that, actually. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  But, yeah, I mean, you have to be fair. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=154.56s)]
*  It's not just the US, right? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=155.92s)]
*  It's now the US, the UK, Israel, Qatar, UAE, and Saudi [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  against the Houthi rebels. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=164.52s)]
*  That's a big alliance, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=166.44s)]
*  and you've gotta think that Iran [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=167.88s)]
*  will think very carefully about how close they wanna get [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=172.16s)]
*  to the Houthis in the middle of all of this, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=174.8s)]
*  because that's a huge armada, if you will, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  of countries that I don't think [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=180.04000000000002s)]
*  you really wanna cross as a group. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=182.0s)]
*  Well, I think Saudi Arabia and UAE [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=184.12s)]
*  are playing this very carefully, I think. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=186.28s)]
*  They did not participate in the strikes. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=189.24s)]
*  They did allow the US to fly overhead [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=191.44s)]
*  or to use its territory, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=194.72s)]
*  but they released a statement [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=196.28s)]
*  calling for restraint and de-escalation. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=198.84s)]
*  So I think they're very nervous about this [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=201.84s)]
*  blowing up into a wider regional war. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=204.28s)]
*  I don't think they want that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=206.16s)]
*  The allies who participated in the campaign of airstrikes [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=208.12s)]
*  were UK, Australia, Canada, Netherlands, and Bahrain, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=212.0s)]
*  but I don't think they actually did anything. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=216.0s)]
*  I don't think they contributed any assets. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=217.6s)]
*  I don't think they just provided their names [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=219.16s)]
*  to this operation. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=221.12s)]
*  I'm providing some diplomatic cover. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=222.92s)]
*  Freeberg, any thoughts? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=225.2s)]
*  Well, Sax, you posted a comment on Twitter, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=226.32s)]
*  which I wanted to respond to, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=229.72s)]
*  where you said China has the largest shipping volume [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=231.96s)]
*  through the Red Sea, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=237.04s)]
*  and they're staying out of this conflict, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=238.48s)]
*  letting the US do the dirty work. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=239.92s)]
*  But the Houthis didn't attack Chinese ships. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=242.0s)]
*  They specifically attacked Western ships. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=245.0s)]
*  Isn't that correct? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=247.04s)]
*  This is a very targeted, disruptive event [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=248.04s)]
*  that the Houthis have been undertaking for some time now, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  and they're using these very interesting tactics [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=253.48s)]
*  with drones that can be very destructive [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=255.6s)]
*  and very hard to block, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=258.12s)]
*  and doing it not at Chinese ships, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=259.68s)]
*  but at a very targeted enemy. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, what the Houthis have said [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=263.24s)]
*  is that they're only attacking ships [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=264.32s)]
*  that are either Israeli or going to Israel, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  but in reality, they've attacked a much wider range than that. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=268.64s)]
*  But not Chinese. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=273.8s)]
*  It may be true that they haven't attacked ships [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=275.08s)]
*  that are declaring themselves to be Chinese ships [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  or Russian ships. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=280.96s)]
*  However, there are more Chinese shipping containers [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=281.8s)]
*  on all of the ships that are going through the Red Sea [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  and the Suez Canal than any other country. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=289.32s)]
*  So there's no question that if we're talking [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=291.79999999999995s)]
*  about the disruption of global trade, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=293.56s)]
*  this is gonna have a big impact on Chinese trade, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=295.47999999999996s)]
*  whether it's on Chinese ships or not. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=299.56s)]
*  Or it could benefit them, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=301.52s)]
*  because they can get through that shipping lane [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=302.96s)]
*  and the West cannot. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  Their own ships can get through, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=306.44s)]
*  but foreign ships, European ships [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=307.26s)]
*  that have Chinese shipping containers on them [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=309.28s)]
*  are not getting through. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=311.64s)]
*  So their trade is still getting disrupted. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=312.91999999999996s)]
*  And they need that. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=315.11999999999995s)]
*  Nevertheless, they don't feel the need [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=315.96s)]
*  to engage in this militaristic response [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=317.84s)]
*  or participate in that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=320.79999999999995s)]
*  So in terms of understanding implications [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=321.64s)]
*  of the escalation in this conflict, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=323.4s)]
*  let's just quickly talk about, number one, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=325.4s)]
*  I'm assuming shipping prices are gonna go up, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=328.32s)]
*  freight prices are gonna go up. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=331.03999999999996s)]
*  But hold on a second, we talked about this with Ryan. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=332.47999999999996s)]
*  Remember the question that I asked him. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=335.44s)]
*  This is really an issue for Europe. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=336.28s)]
*  It's not an issue for the United States, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=337.44s)]
*  because there are alternative routes. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  You can go through the Pacific [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=340.9s)]
*  and you can go down through the bottom of Africa, right? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=341.91999999999996s)]
*  And all that does is add like a five or 10% increase. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=345.84s)]
*  So what we're really debating is what is the risk [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=348.76s)]
*  of inflation and a backup of goods [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=351.56s)]
*  and shipping rates into Europe? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=354.76s)]
*  And this is why I don't understand why America [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=357.15999999999997s)]
*  needs to even get involved. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=359.46s)]
*  I understand why the Netherlands and the UK and France [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=360.8s)]
*  and all these folks need to send resources to unclog this. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=364.24s)]
*  That makes a lot of sense. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=367.72s)]
*  But I don't see why the US needs to be involved. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  Other than providing moral support or logistical support, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=373.88s)]
*  what is the point? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=377.08s)]
*  Well, Chamath, this is exactly my point, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=378.08s)]
*  is the number one type of trade [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=379.7s)]
*  that's going through the Red Sea [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=382.88s)]
*  are shipping containers from China going to European ports. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=384.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=388.8s)]
*  And as a result of what the Houthis are doing, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  it's having to go around the Horn of Africa. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=392.06s)]
*  It's adding two or three weeks to the trip [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=394.04s)]
*  and it's raising the cost of a shipping container [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=396.56s)]
*  from China from, say, $1,500 to $3,000. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=398.68s)]
*  It's Europe and China who are impacted the most. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=402.84s)]
*  But for some reason, it's the US that decides [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=405.08s)]
*  it has to take the lead in doing this. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=407.68s)]
*  And the problem is that, first of all, the action is futile. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=409.48s)]
*  I mean, the Houthis have been at war on and off [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=414.24s)]
*  with the Saudis for a decade, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=417.64s)]
*  and the Saudis have been backed by Western weapons, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=419.36s)]
*  and we have not been able to defeat the Houthis. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=422.3s)]
*  So this missile strike last night is not going to deter them. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=424.46000000000004s)]
*  It's not going to stop them. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=428.48s)]
*  They're very determined, very tough fighters. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=429.78000000000003s)]
*  Second, they are going to be looking for retaliation. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=432.46000000000004s)]
*  They're going to be looking for blowback. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=435.32s)]
*  And, Chamath, to your point, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=436.86s)]
*  they're not going to be looking for retaliation [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=439.22s)]
*  against China or Europe. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=440.66s)]
*  They're going to be looking at it against the United States. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=442.34000000000003s)]
*  So we're incurring this cost and risk onto ourselves. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=444.94s)]
*  So let me put this question to you, then. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=448.82s)]
*  We have no obvious economic incentive to get involved [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=451.5s)]
*  because we can sustain our economy [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=456.02000000000004s)]
*  through different shipping ports [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=459.26000000000005s)]
*  that at best raise rates five or 10%. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=460.46000000000004s)]
*  We can absorb that in the economy. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=462.82000000000005s)]
*  100%, which could drive inflation, is a European problem. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=464.70000000000005s)]
*  So there's no economic incentive necessarily [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=468.46000000000004s)]
*  to get involved. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=470.62s)]
*  So what is the incentive? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=471.46000000000004s)]
*  It feels like, not to play conspiracy theorist, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=473.1s)]
*  but like a wag the dog moment. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=475.82000000000005s)]
*  Another distraction to add to the plate. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=479.58000000000004s)]
*  What do you think about that line of thinking? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=484.26s)]
*  I tweeted something just like that. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=485.98s)]
*  This does feel, it's a wag the dog in the sense [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=488.14000000000004s)]
*  that the Biden administration was looking- [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=491.14000000000004s)]
*  You want to explain the reference for folks [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=493.3s)]
*  that may not get it? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=494.74s)]
*  Yeah, there's a movie called Wag the Dog [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=495.58000000000004s)]
*  that came out in the early 90s [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=496.54s)]
*  where the president is up for reelection [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=498.18s)]
*  and there's a horrible scandal that's about to come out, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=502.08000000000004s)]
*  like a Monica Lewinsky type scandal. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=504.86s)]
*  This is before Monica Lewinsky, by the way. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=506.86s)]
*  It really was sort of one of those movies [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=510.14s)]
*  that kind of predicted the future. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=512.34s)]
*  But in any event, the president's trying to avoid [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=514.14s)]
*  this Monica Lewinsky type scandal. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=516.74s)]
*  And so the political aides and advisors [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=518.78s)]
*  decide the way to do that is to start a war. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=522.9s)]
*  But they don't start a real war. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=525.66s)]
*  They basically manufacture a fake war on a soundstage [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=526.82s)]
*  and then in a movie studio. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=529.94s)]
*  And it's pretty hilarious how they keep [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=532.1800000000001s)]
*  the whole thing going. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=534.0s)]
*  David Mamet, who's a brilliant, brilliant writer, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=535.22s)]
*  wrote that script. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=537.38s)]
*  But this movie came out right around the time [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=539.86s)]
*  of the Lewinsky scandal with Clinton. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=541.62s)]
*  And so therefore it took on this larger [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=543.54s)]
*  political and cultural significance. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=545.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's been used. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=547.06s)]
*  So yeah, so Wag the Dog is, you basically start a war [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=547.9s)]
*  because of the political benefits [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=551.6999999999999s)]
*  as opposed to the real necessity of going to war. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=553.38s)]
*  And I think you can make that accusation here, Chamath, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=557.18s)]
*  because I think that the Biden administration [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=559.22s)]
*  was looking impotent. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=561.14s)]
*  I mean, they were basically telling the hooties to stop. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=562.42s)]
*  They were pleading with them to stop interfering [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=564.48s)]
*  with international shipping. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=566.4399999999999s)]
*  The hooties weren't listening. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=567.98s)]
*  By the way, the reason why the hooties are doing this [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=570.3000000000001s)]
*  is they're doing it in solidarity [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=572.3000000000001s)]
*  with the Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=573.82s)]
*  They've demanded that the Israeli invasion of Gaza stop [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=575.5200000000001s)]
*  and humanitarian aid be let in. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=578.22s)]
*  And they're not gonna stop interfering with global trade [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=580.8000000000001s)]
*  until that happens. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=582.9000000000001s)]
*  So that's the hooties' position. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=583.82s)]
*  The Biden administration has been telling them to stop. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=585.72s)]
*  And I think that they were looking increasingly feckless [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=588.1400000000001s)]
*  and impotent. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=592.6600000000001s)]
*  And that's why they did this strike. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=594.0s)]
*  The problem is that the strike's not gonna have any impact. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=596.3s)]
*  And so what's the point? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=599.3s)]
*  Well, is it that or is it that, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=602.26s)]
*  I think if you take the wag the dog analogy to the limit, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=604.06s)]
*  I think maybe a different interpretation, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=607.52s)]
*  I'm not saying that they did this, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=610.1s)]
*  but a different interpretation of that analogy would be [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=611.16s)]
*  that they are struggling domestically. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=614.38s)]
*  And I think J Cal tweeted this, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=616.9s)]
*  but if you look at the polls [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=618.46s)]
*  and you look at Dean Phillips all of a sudden, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=619.54s)]
*  and you look at what's happening on the Republican side, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=621.34s)]
*  there's so much activity and momentum frankly [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=624.42s)]
*  for non-Biden candidates all across the board [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=629.4599999999999s)]
*  that that would be the most wag the dog explanation [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=634.9799999999999s)]
*  in my opinion, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=638.18s)]
*  which is like to distract folks from the domestic malaise [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=639.02s)]
*  by pointing someplace far away and saying, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=643.02s)]
*  we're doing something very righteous here. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=645.54s)]
*  Let's all get on the same page and support us. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=647.2199999999999s)]
*  How does that logically make sense, Jamath? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=649.66s)]
*  The US is against wars and people are tired of wars. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=651.98s)]
*  Like what would be the, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=655.64s)]
*  this is the only problem I have with the logic [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=657.1s)]
*  of the wag the dog theory is nobody wants wars. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=658.7s)]
*  Who's against wars, Jason? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=662.62s)]
*  The American people. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=664.34s)]
*  They've been very much against starting foreign wars. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=665.38s)]
*  We've talked about it here. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=668.22s)]
*  Let's talk about the people that run the country. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=669.38s)]
*  No, I know that. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=672.3000000000001s)]
*  So what you're saying they're doing it, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=673.14s)]
*  the logic here is wag the dog is to curry favor. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=674.48s)]
*  It's actually said they're rallying. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=677.88s)]
*  This is to rally the American people around [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=679.78s)]
*  like a patriotic cause, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=681.66s)]
*  but this isn't like a, you know, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=683.54s)]
*  9-11 situation where Bush got a lot of credibility [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=685.9s)]
*  for saying, hey, we're gonna go get these terrorists. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=689.3s)]
*  Americans don't want more wars right now. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=691.78s)]
*  The polling is very specific on that. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=693.86s)]
*  So then I guess, Sax, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=695.48s)]
*  what is the logic there to wag the dog [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=696.78s)]
*  if this is something American people don't want? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=700.78s)]
*  Well, I think you're right, Jason, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=703.3399999999999s)]
*  in the sense that the American people are exhausted by wars, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=705.22s)]
*  especially Middle Eastern wars. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=708.26s)]
*  We've just gotten out of two decades [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=710.1s)]
*  of endless forever wars in the Middle East, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=712.06s)]
*  and I don't think the majority of the American people [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=714.26s)]
*  wanna get back in. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=716.98s)]
*  So I think you're right on that level. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=719.66s)]
*  And it's true that if you were to poll the American people [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=722.14s)]
*  and ask them are you in favor of getting in more wars, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=723.9s)]
*  they would say no. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=725.9399999999999s)]
*  The problem is that with every war, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=726.8199999999999s)]
*  the mainstream media starts propagandizing for the wars, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=729.7s)]
*  and they'll basically demonize whoever it is [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=733.1s)]
*  that we're gonna go to war with [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=735.26s)]
*  and explaining why they're a huge threat. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=736.74s)]
*  They'll engage in threat inflation. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=739.98s)]
*  And so the American people end up supporting it. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=741.94s)]
*  So we're against war in the abstract, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=744.46s)]
*  but in every particular case, we end up supporting it. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=746.82s)]
*  That's what happened with Ukraine. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=749.5s)]
*  It's even happening right now. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=750.86s)]
*  If you look at polling for this hootie conflict, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=751.94s)]
*  I think most Americans believe it's a good thing [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=754.28s)]
*  to strike the hooties. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=756.84s)]
*  So yeah, there are against it in the abstract, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=758.8s)]
*  but in each particular case, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=760.62s)]
*  the media is able to manufacture consent [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=763.34s)]
*  for the US involvement. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=766.02s)]
*  So just to challenge that as well. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=768.74s)]
*  So now our theory is, or your theory is, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=771.6999999999999s)]
*  the media plus the Biden administration are in cahoots [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=775.5799999999999s)]
*  to wag the dog, create this support of a war [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=780.54s)]
*  in order to distract from domestic issues [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=784.9s)]
*  in order to curry favor with the American public [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=788.26s)]
*  that doesn't really want more wars. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=790.42s)]
*  That's where I'm saying, like, I think wag the dog [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=792.5799999999999s)]
*  might have been something 20 years ago, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=794.5s)]
*  like you're saying, that could work as a technique, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=796.1s)]
*  but I can't imagine anybody would want to do more [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=799.4200000000001s)]
*  military action at this point in time [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=804.5600000000001s)]
*  when the American public is exhausted from it. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=807.1800000000001s)]
*  Which is what you said for the last six months [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=809.7800000000001s)]
*  on this podcast. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=811.74s)]
*  Yeah, look, I tweeted exactly that sentiment, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=812.58s)]
*  is that I don't think wagging the dog is gonna work. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=814.58s)]
*  I think there'll be a short-term rally [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=817.12s)]
*  around the flag effect, but I think that overall, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=819.0600000000001s)]
*  if this conflict is still going on in November, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=823.96s)]
*  it's gonna weaken Biden by making him look like a president [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=826.6800000000001s)]
*  who's lost control of events. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=829.44s)]
*  So I agree with you that ultimately the perpetuation [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=832.08s)]
*  of this conflict is not ultimately in Biden's interest. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=835.36s)]
*  Now, nonetheless, it may factor into their political [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=839.44s)]
*  calculation that in the short term, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=842.36s)]
*  they think this makes them look good. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=844.8000000000001s)]
*  That would seem super incompetent as like [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=846.44s)]
*  a political strategy to me, but I'm no political expert. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=848.48s)]
*  I mean, despite the fact that this administration [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=851.48s)]
*  claimed to be the foreign policy grownups, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=854.48s)]
*  they haven't shown a lot of competence. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=856.0s)]
*  They couldn't even find Lloyd Austin, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=858.0400000000001s)]
*  who's the secretary of defense for five days. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=859.32s)]
*  No one knew where he was. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=861.6s)]
*  Just so what happened. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=862.44s)]
*  No, he checked into the hospital for a procedure [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=865.0400000000001s)]
*  and no one could find him for several days. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=867.0400000000001s)]
*  And there was an article, I think on CNN, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=869.4s)]
*  talking about how he was managing this hootie strike [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=871.08s)]
*  from his hospital bed. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=873.6s)]
*  Yeah, that was weird. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=877.0s)]
*  I hope the man's okay. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=877.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't want, you know. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=879.1600000000001s)]
*  He's got prostate cancer. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=880.0s)]
*  I know, that's sad. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=881.6800000000001s)]
*  He had a UTI. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=883.96s)]
*  That's why he was in the hospital. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=884.8000000000001s)]
*  But fair enough, but no one in the White House, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=886.1600000000001s)]
*  the White House couldn't find him for a couple of days. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=887.88s)]
*  Is that true they couldn't find him? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=890.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=891.5200000000001s)]
*  Having a UTI is a very benign kind of thing, right? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=892.36s)]
*  Well, he had a prostatectomy [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=894.84s)]
*  and then he got discharged from the hospital. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=897.7600000000001s)]
*  And somewhere along the way, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=900.5200000000001s)]
*  he got a UTI, which was severe apparently. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=902.8000000000001s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=905.88s)]
*  Went back to Walter Reed. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=906.72s)]
*  And yeah, in those three or four days, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=907.5400000000001s)]
*  the handoff of power to his deputy happened. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=909.8s)]
*  She was on vacation on a beach somewhere. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=915.2s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=917.36s)]
*  And the problem was that the other person, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=919.04s)]
*  the chief of staff had the flu, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=922.16s)]
*  so they couldn't escalate to the White House. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=924.4s)]
*  So it was like a comedy of errors, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=926.36s)]
*  but I don't think it was anything. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=928.72s)]
*  But anyways. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=930.16s)]
*  I mean, imagine if you were like a C-level executive [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=931.0s)]
*  at a company and you're gonna be out of the office [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=935.0s)]
*  for a few days and unreachable, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=938.48s)]
*  you would set up a clear chain of command. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=940.5600000000001s)]
*  You'd have a deputy who the CEO [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=943.6400000000001s)]
*  could get ahold of if necessary. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=944.9200000000001s)]
*  In this case, you've got the secretary of defense [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=947.32s)]
*  who if the United States was attacked in some way [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=949.44s)]
*  is part of the chain of command. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=952.6s)]
*  The president would need that person in the situation room. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=953.84s)]
*  So the fact that they couldn't find him [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=957.08s)]
*  for a couple of days is really, I think, unforgivable. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=958.4000000000001s)]
*  How does that even happen? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=961.84s)]
*  Is that really true that they couldn't find him? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=962.9200000000001s)]
*  Like they literally could not call- [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=965.32s)]
*  I didn't know where he was for a couple of days. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=966.1600000000001s)]
*  This was widely reported. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=967.48s)]
*  But they couldn't call him on his cell phone [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=969.24s)]
*  or his chief of staff or the eight people who- [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=971.48s)]
*  Nobody knew where he was. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=973.2s)]
*  Wow. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=976.04s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=977.4s)]
*  All right, very good. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=978.24s)]
*  Having kept up on the details of his UTI [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=979.9200000000001s)]
*  and his cancer, I hope he's okay. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=983.04s)]
*  So segueing into markets, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=984.48s)]
*  the likelihood of a Q1 rate cut is not looking good. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=987.4s)]
*  We had a slightly hotter than expected December CPI [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=991.44s)]
*  interest rates hit a 22 year high in July, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=994.4399999999999s)]
*  as everybody knows when the Fed raised the range [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=997.64s)]
*  from 5.25 to 5.5, but they've left rates unchanged [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=999.3199999999999s)]
*  if you haven't been following it as inflation has cooled. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1003.8s)]
*  But in December, the CPI rose 3.4% from a year earlier. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1008.36s)]
*  That was just a slight tick above. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1013.12s)]
*  And of course, markets are wondering, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1014.92s)]
*  is this gonna be a glide path into a soft landing [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1018.1999999999999s)]
*  or could it be choppy going forward? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1022.8s)]
*  Freeburg higher for longer interest rates. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1025.68s)]
*  You think that's still gonna be the case [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1029.04s)]
*  and what are your thoughts going into the new year? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1031.24s)]
*  Well, Larry Summers put out a note saying that he thinks [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1034.24s)]
*  that the rates are gonna stay higher than the market [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1037.76s)]
*  is predicting based on the yield curve right now. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1041.8799999999999s)]
*  So I think the market's currently saying no cuts in March [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1045.6s)]
*  and high probability of cuts in June. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1048.68s)]
*  But some folks like Larry are saying might be longer [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1054.92s)]
*  because inflation is very sticky. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1058.8s)]
*  And if you look at the breakdown on the drivers of inflation, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1061.2s)]
*  you start to think about what's the underlying [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1065.76s)]
*  business activity that's going on. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1068.44s)]
*  Like car insurance went up by 20%, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1070.24s)]
*  which was one of the key drivers. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1073.5600000000002s)]
*  And car insurance has always been this lagging indicator, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1075.56s)]
*  but it does ultimately drive costs up later. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1081.36s)]
*  The reason car insurance rates go up [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1084.12s)]
*  is because the cost to repair a car goes up [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1085.8799999999999s)]
*  and the cost for medical care goes up. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1088.08s)]
*  When that happens, the insurance companies [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1089.6799999999998s)]
*  actually have to file with state regulators [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1091.56s)]
*  to get approval to raise their rates. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1093.44s)]
*  And it can take over a year for the regulators [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1095.6799999999998s)]
*  to then approve those raising of rates. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1098.04s)]
*  So by the time the rates get raised, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1100.24s)]
*  the other factors have maybe leveled out, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1102.8799999999999s)]
*  but you're still gonna have some elements of costs [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1105.76s)]
*  that are gonna continue to climb for some period of time [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1109.6399999999999s)]
*  after you get the core engine tuned down. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1111.9599999999998s)]
*  So these are the sorts of things that I think we're seeing [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1115.1599999999999s)]
*  in the current CPI data, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1117.1599999999999s)]
*  is that there are some of these lagging effects [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1119.72s)]
*  of an overheated economy or overstimulated economy [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1122.12s)]
*  that are now starting to play through. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1125.36s)]
*  And so there's a number of these. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1127.72s)]
*  It's not just car insurance, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1128.8s)]
*  but there's a lot of things that are gonna linger [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1129.84s)]
*  for a while and they're gonna be very hard [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1131.2s)]
*  to work their way through the system very quickly. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1132.6000000000001s)]
*  And as a result, it may be the case [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1134.88s)]
*  that rates are gonna need to stay higher for longer. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1136.8s)]
*  I think the thing with inflation that is worth noting [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1138.76s)]
*  is that a couple of things are true at the same time, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1141.32s)]
*  which I think is interesting. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1144.52s)]
*  I think we were the ones in May of 21 [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1146.92s)]
*  that started getting very antsy around inflation [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1150.96s)]
*  and we started to look at the five and 10 year breakevens. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1153.4s)]
*  Do you guys remember that? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1156.96s)]
*  We would like look at that chart a lot. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1157.8s)]
*  And I think it was very predictive. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1160.08s)]
*  We also used to look at the future oil curve. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1163.6s)]
*  Not that we're macroeconomists, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1166.6s)]
*  but I think it's useful if average everyday people [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1168.48s)]
*  can have a few things to look at. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1172.3999999999999s)]
*  If you look at those things today, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1174.12s)]
*  it tells you the same picture, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1176.96s)]
*  which is inflation has cooled. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1179.48s)]
*  We're going through the last kind of like throws [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1181.76s)]
*  some of the random variables still being a little sticky, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1186.3999999999999s)]
*  but the broad trend is down. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1190.28s)]
*  I think it's indisputable. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1193.32s)]
*  At the same time, even with the conflagrations [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1195.24s)]
*  in the Middle East, if you look at what people think [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1199.36s)]
*  about the future price of oil, it's also down. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1202.12s)]
*  Oil futures are, I think about five to 10%, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1205.2s)]
*  future prices are about five to 10% lower than spot right now [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1209.2s)]
*  for whatever that's worth. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1212.3999999999999s)]
*  But the third thing, which I think is important, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1213.8s)]
*  is we've now started to see folks come back [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1216.48s)]
*  from the new year and start to affect [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1217.92s)]
*  some pretty big layoffs and they're across industries. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1220.96s)]
*  Citibank today just announced 20,000 layoffs. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1225.24s)]
*  That's a huge amount of people [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1228.12s)]
*  that are gonna lose their jobs. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1229.84s)]
*  So what does all of this mean? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1231.4s)]
*  It's that I think that people expect [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1232.84s)]
*  that as inflation contracts, the money supply will expand, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1234.84s)]
*  but demand has yet to reset properly. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1239.84s)]
*  So that's the last thing. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1244.16s)]
*  And I think Freebird's mentioned this a bunch. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1245.88s)]
*  Consumer spending has always been crazy. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1246.96s)]
*  People living on credit, all of this stuff. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1249.04s)]
*  That is now finally, I think, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1251.76s)]
*  the last thing that has to get sorted out. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1254.16s)]
*  So in the absence of demand, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1256.24s)]
*  back to the way you started, Jason, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1258.04s)]
*  companies will cut expenses [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1259.96s)]
*  in order to maintain profitability [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1261.3600000000001s)]
*  because they don't really wanna cut prices [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1262.8s)]
*  unless their product really sucks. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1264.24s)]
*  Yeah, and just to note that Citigroup, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1266.52s)]
*  as you mentioned, 20,000 cuts by 2026. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1268.68s)]
*  Google also laid off hundreds of people. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1271.96s)]
*  Amazon, hundreds of people. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1275.76s)]
*  Discord laid off 17%. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1276.52s)]
*  And there's a viral video going around [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1278.44s)]
*  of a woman laid off by CloudFlare, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1280.04s)]
*  who was only on the team for like six months or something [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1283.4s)]
*  or five months. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1286.2s)]
*  And it does seem like, yeah, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1287.0800000000002s)]
*  firing people before the holidays, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1289.88s)]
*  laying them off is considered, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1291.28s)]
*  yeah, you don't do it in the fourth quarter. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1292.8000000000002s)]
*  So maybe there was some backed up layoffs [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1294.3200000000002s)]
*  that people decided to do into this year, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1297.1200000000001s)]
*  but it certainly feels like SACs people are, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1299.5600000000002s)]
*  and you said this, I think, in the predictions episode [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1303.6399999999999s)]
*  or the recap episode, hey, maybe, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1305.7199999999998s)]
*  it's still gonna be a little bit of turbulence [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1307.9199999999998s)]
*  and the soft landing isn't guaranteed. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1309.76s)]
*  Maybe you could expand on that. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1311.8s)]
*  Yeah, my prediction for the year was bumpy landing. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1313.6s)]
*  I thought soft landing was a little too optimistic. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1317.56s)]
*  And I also thought that this big stock market rally [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1319.7199999999998s)]
*  that we had in November, December was too much too soon. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1321.76s)]
*  The market, starting in November, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1325.1599999999999s)]
*  started pricing in about 1.5% of rate cuts this year, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1327.24s)]
*  believing that the inflation problem had been licked. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1330.7199999999998s)]
*  Now what we're seeing is, first of all, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1333.8s)]
*  you had a slightly hotter than expected inflation report. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1335.28s)]
*  And now we have this escalating situation in Yemen [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1338.2s)]
*  where this war in the Middle East might expand. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1342.52s)]
*  And just so you understand, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1347.04s)]
*  I mean, the Houthis have already said [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1348.4s)]
*  that if the United States attacks them [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1349.88s)]
*  and uses Saudi or UAE airspace to do it, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1353.92s)]
*  that they will consider themselves at war [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1356.72s)]
*  with Saudi Arabia and UAE, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1358.84s)]
*  and that they will try to do things like light [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1360.36s)]
*  the Saudi oil fields on fire. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1362.8s)]
*  I don't think they have the capability [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1364.52s)]
*  to do that necessarily, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1365.8s)]
*  but it's an indication that things are very volatile. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1367.0s)]
*  Another thing I think we're likely to see [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1370.16s)]
*  in the Middle East is continued attacks [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1371.8799999999999s)]
*  on US military bases in Iraq and Syria. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1374.28s)]
*  So that whole region is a powder keg. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1378.96s)]
*  And if it develops into a wider regional war, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1381.24s)]
*  then I think you could see an oil shock. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1384.12s)]
*  And if there's an oil shock, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1386.4s)]
*  I think you can kiss rate cuts goodbye [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1387.8s)]
*  because that's gonna percolate through the whole economy [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1389.48s)]
*  and have a big impact on inflation. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1391.8s)]
*  So I just think that there's a lot of downside [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1394.3999999999999s)]
*  to these very optimistic projections [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1399.12s)]
*  that we're gonna get these huge rate cuts. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1401.36s)]
*  It might happen, but I just see a lot of risk. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1404.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1407.8799999999999s)]
*  Freberg, do you think these oil shocks [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1408.72s)]
*  are here for the long term or a possibility? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1410.44s)]
*  You've been talking a lot about alternative energy, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1412.76s)]
*  nuclear, obviously. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1416.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so is, and the US has become a net exporter of oil. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1419.04s)]
*  So do you think this risk of oil disruption [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1424.3600000000001s)]
*  from the Middle East is with us for the long term [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1428.76s)]
*  or do you think that's waning now? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1430.4s)]
*  There's definitely structural risk [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1432.3600000000001s)]
*  because you have a supply chain [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1434.52s)]
*  that can get disrupted in a number of ways [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1440.2s)]
*  and limited alternative options. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1443.72s)]
*  If you look at the chart I just shared, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1446.4799999999998s)]
*  it's the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1448.4399999999998s)]
*  So we have about 350 million barrels [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1451.8799999999999s)]
*  in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve today. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1455.08s)]
*  That's down from, call it early 21 [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1457.9199999999998s)]
*  when we were at 650 million barrels. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1463.0s)]
*  And it was pretty much at that level for decades [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1466.1999999999998s)]
*  after the buildup leading up to 1990. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1470.24s)]
*  We haven't been at a level this low [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1472.9599999999998s)]
*  in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve since 1983. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1474.88s)]
*  And so there's not a lot of levers [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1478.3200000000002s)]
*  for the government to intervene to support the supply [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1481.2s)]
*  as there may have been in the last couple of years [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1486.3600000000001s)]
*  in the case of some supply shock [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1489.24s)]
*  because of a conflict that arises [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1491.16s)]
*  in a major oil producing region. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1492.96s)]
*  It's a really interesting chart, isn't it? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1495.16s)]
*  Because that was after the oil crisis of the 70s [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1496.44s)]
*  and you look at how long it took to build it up [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1499.6000000000001s)]
*  and how large we built it. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1501.6000000000001s)]
*  I've never seen that chart before, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1504.08s)]
*  but if you look at the, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1505.52s)]
*  I don't know if you guys remember the oil lines, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1507.32s)]
*  did you have them in Canada, Shama? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1509.68s)]
*  Where I remember in Brooklyn, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1511.32s)]
*  you had an even number or odd number license plate thing. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1512.88s)]
*  If you wanted to get gas, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1516.1200000000001s)]
*  some days was the even number, some days was the odd number. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1518.16s)]
*  I remember my parents getting online for gas [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1520.52s)]
*  and waiting for two hours or three hours to get gas. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1522.04s)]
*  Yeah, by the way, I'll say this is not a real cost today [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1524.76s)]
*  that we're experiencing, but as Sachs is pointing out, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1527.92s)]
*  there's a number of ways that this can become a real cost. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1530.24s)]
*  I was in Austin this week [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1532.68s)]
*  and the thing that shocked me the most [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1535.28s)]
*  was how cheap gas was at the gas station. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1537.3600000000001s)]
*  You can get gas for like two bucks and 25 cents a gallon. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1539.28s)]
*  Pretty awesome. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1542.8400000000001s)]
*  It's like $6 when you're in Lake Tahoe. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1543.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1546.3200000000002s)]
*  Just so everyone understands how the SPR got depleted, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1547.16s)]
*  last year when inflation was the top story [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1549.3200000000002s)]
*  on the front page of every newspaper [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1553.8s)]
*  and gas prices were hitting what, seven or $8, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1555.6000000000001s)]
*  the administration started releasing crude [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1558.76s)]
*  from the SPR to try and bring the price down [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1562.0s)]
*  and they did that for about a year [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1565.1200000000001s)]
*  and they were basically subsidizing the price of oil. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1566.8s)]
*  Now, that's why our stockpile is low [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1570.0s)]
*  and that was a really great political strategy, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1572.72s)]
*  but if we end up in a real crisis, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1575.2s)]
*  we're gonna have less dry powder to deal with it. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1577.8400000000001s)]
*  So, we could have a perfect storm [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1580.48s)]
*  of things coming together here [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1582.96s)]
*  where at precisely the time we end up getting involved [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1584.96s)]
*  in a big war in the Middle East [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1588.64s)]
*  our tools to mitigate the oil shock that would create [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1590.24s)]
*  have been reduced by what the administration's done [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1594.68s)]
*  over the past year. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1598.04s)]
*  Now, I don't know that that's gonna happen. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1599.28s)]
*  I mean, I still think we're several steps away [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1601.2s)]
*  from a regional war, but you look at how many fronts now [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1602.92s)]
*  we have conflict in the Middle East. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1607.64s)]
*  There's about five different fronts where there's conflict. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1609.88s)]
*  You've obviously got Israel's war in Gaza. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1612.8400000000001s)]
*  You've got Hezbollah in the North, basically firing rockets. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1616.48s)]
*  You've got US bases in Syria and Iraq coming under attack [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1620.44s)]
*  and now we have the US striking Yemen. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1625.8s)]
*  So, there's just so many ways [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1628.68s)]
*  that this could spiral out of control. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1630.3600000000001s)]
*  Isn't the SPR designed so that when we have [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1632.52s)]
*  an economic crisis like this to use it? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1634.72s)]
*  Like, I mean, it's- [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1636.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the Biden administration has a lot to dip in. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1637.2s)]
*  By the way, you have to give credit [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1639.72s)]
*  to the Biden administration in one form. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1641.0s)]
*  It's not necessarily skilled per se, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1644.56s)]
*  but when you look at the SPR depletion, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1646.2s)]
*  they were selling at incredible moments in the market. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1649.68s)]
*  And the energy department, I think they just announced [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1653.16s)]
*  that they're buying another four or $8 billion [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1657.92s)]
*  to replenish the SPR. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1661.92s)]
*  So, they'll be doing that now, but they were selling, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1663.3600000000001s)]
*  if you look at these price points here, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1666.1200000000001s)]
*  they were selling when prices were $80 and $90 a barrel [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1667.64s)]
*  and now they're buying it back at $70. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1671.6000000000001s)]
*  So, at least the United States can take some solace [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1673.08s)]
*  in the fact that we arbed out [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1676.36s)]
*  a few billion dollars for Treasury. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1677.96s)]
*  I wonder how the SPR relates to consumption. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1679.6399999999999s)]
*  We see this chart, but it's in the number of barrels, right? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1683.84s)]
*  350 million barrels or something like that. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1686.56s)]
*  Is that what the chart says? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1689.36s)]
*  And then it peaked at six or 700,000. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1690.1999999999998s)]
*  I wonder what it needs to be, Chamath or Freiburg, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1692.56s)]
*  as a percentage of our consumption, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1696.0s)]
*  as more EVs hit the market, right? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1697.6799999999998s)]
*  And as the number of miles per gallon goes up. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1699.8799999999999s)]
*  So, I couldn't find a chart for that. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1703.56s)]
*  I tried to find it. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1705.08s)]
*  If anybody in the audience knows the SPR [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1705.9199999999998s)]
*  in relation to consumption, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1708.24s)]
*  that would be a very important chart, no? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1709.56s)]
*  I think they're pretty independent, Jason. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1712.0s)]
*  How so? [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1714.24s)]
*  We just build it up independent of what we need? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1715.84s)]
*  No, the strategic petroleum reserve is essentially that. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1718.32s)]
*  It's not meant to be something that's meant to [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1721.76s)]
*  bookend usage. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1727.28s)]
*  If in a highly functioning market, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1728.88s)]
*  there's theoretically an infinite amount of oil [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1730.44s)]
*  that's available. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1733.0s)]
*  And so if there's more consumption, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1733.96s)]
*  you'll be able to find more oil. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1735.88s)]
*  You'll just have to pay a different price for it. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1737.48s)]
*  This SPR is meant to be used [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1739.5200000000002s)]
*  in very different kinds of situations. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1740.88s)]
*  This one is interesting. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1742.72s)]
*  Yeah, right, when there's a disruption. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1743.92s)]
*  When there's an acute disruption. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1745.64s)]
*  It's supposed to be break glass in case of emergency. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1747.3200000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1749.88s)]
*  Yeah, but how many days is it supposed to last [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1750.72s)]
*  is what I'm sort of getting at. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1752.24s)]
*  That's what I wonder, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1753.72s)]
*  because over time, are we consuming more oil now [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1754.5600000000002s)]
*  as a country or are we consuming less? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1757.88s)]
*  I would think consuming more. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1759.6000000000001s)]
*  But the thing you have to keep in mind [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1760.72s)]
*  is that even in an acute shock, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1762.1200000000001s)]
*  what you can't just look at the SPR [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1764.2800000000002s)]
*  because we have now domestic oil capability. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1766.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1769.2800000000002s)]
*  And a lot of that developed under two presidents, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1770.24s)]
*  Obama and Trump. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1772.5200000000002s)]
*  And both of them deserve a lot of credit [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1773.88s)]
*  because we have a capability now [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1775.4s)]
*  to be self-sufficient. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1779.72s)]
*  And we are a net exporter because of the work that happened [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1781.0800000000002s)]
*  during that time. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1784.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, not guess. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1785.24s)]
*  Oh my gosh, do you guys see all of this [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1786.2s)]
*  machigana with Carta this week? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1788.72s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1790.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1791.72s)]
*  Actually, it's on the docket. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1792.68s)]
*  So those of you who don't know Carta is cap table software, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1794.1200000000001s)]
*  if you don't know what the cap and cap table is, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1796.8400000000001s)]
*  which many of you might not, stands for capitalization. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1799.76s)]
*  What is it? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1802.0400000000002s)]
*  It's a Google or an Excel sheet that says, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1802.88s)]
*  who owns the number of shares in a company? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1805.68s)]
*  This gets very complex in private companies [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1807.1200000000001s)]
*  and they've made quite a business out of it. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1809.6000000000001s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, can I pause you? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1811.28s)]
*  There was a lot of comments that said exactly that. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1812.64s)]
*  It gets very complicated. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1815.2s)]
*  I apologize. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1817.0s)]
*  I've owned equity in companies for 20 years. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1817.96s)]
*  What the hell is exactly complicated? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1820.88s)]
*  Well, I don't understand that statement. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1823.8s)]
*  I'm not directing it at you, Jason. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1825.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1826.88s)]
*  I can tell you. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1827.72s)]
*  Because I feel like that is like some BS statement. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1829.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's not. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1833.0800000000002s)]
*  The thing is you as acting as a price round individual [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1834.1200000000001s)]
*  in a lot of these cases, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1837.68s)]
*  it was very simple to do a price round. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1839.0s)]
*  But when you insert its safes into this, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1841.52s)]
*  a simple agreement for future equity [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1845.44s)]
*  that Y Combinator created [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1847.4s)]
*  and you put capital convertible notes into this, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1848.76s)]
*  founders started doing like dozens of these, Chamath. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1853.3600000000001s)]
*  And at the early stages, the cleanup work [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1855.8s)]
*  and understanding how many shares people owned, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1857.8400000000001s)]
*  especially with- [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1860.52s)]
*  No, but J Cal, what I'm saying is why, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1861.3600000000001s)]
*  like, okay, let me stop. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1863.2s)]
*  Let me ask you a different one. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1865.8s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1866.96s)]
*  We did this with spreadsheets. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1867.8s)]
*  Let me answer your question. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1869.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1870.64s)]
*  So in a private company, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1871.48s)]
*  let's say a company issues options to an employee [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1873.04s)]
*  and they don't have a good record of that. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1875.84s)]
*  The employee executes the options. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1877.44s)]
*  They now believe that they own shares. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1879.12s)]
*  Unlike in a public company where there's a broker of record, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1881.32s)]
*  every share is registered in a public company. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1885.08s)]
*  You know who owns the shares. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1887.3999999999999s)]
*  You know what broker is holding those shares [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1888.6399999999999s)]
*  and every share is traded through a public exchange. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1890.68s)]
*  So there's a record of every transaction [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1893.24s)]
*  that takes place with every share in a public company. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1895.08s)]
*  In a private company, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1898.12s)]
*  there's no independent legal regulator [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1898.96s)]
*  that tracks all the shares. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1902.44s)]
*  So you could issue options to an employee [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1904.0400000000002s)]
*  and forget that you did that, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1906.48s)]
*  put the document in a drawer, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1908.2s)]
*  and the employee shows up five years later [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1910.24s)]
*  and they're like, wait, or- [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1911.88s)]
*  I get it. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1913.0400000000002s)]
*  I've experienced this. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1913.88s)]
*  I've had advisors show up, be like, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1914.7s)]
*  look, here's my advisory agreement. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1916.16s)]
*  I was given options. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1917.44s)]
*  I get it. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1918.2800000000002s)]
*  I'm asking a different question. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1919.24s)]
*  You're saying something. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1920.8000000000002s)]
*  Great, I get that. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1922.2s)]
*  I'll tell you what I think the killer feature was. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1923.0400000000002s)]
*  Why is that complicated to implement in software? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1923.88s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1927.76s)]
*  I think the killer feature for Carta, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1928.6000000000001s)]
*  it was called e-shares back then, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1930.52s)]
*  was getting the shareholder to sign [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1932.6s)]
*  for their stock certificates. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1934.12s)]
*  So to Freeberg's point, in the old world, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1936.0s)]
*  where it was all done by email and a spreadsheet, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1938.24s)]
*  they would literally have to send you [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1940.74s)]
*  a paper stock certificate that you put in a file cabinet. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1942.18s)]
*  If you lost it, you have to sign a document [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1944.32s)]
*  with a lawyer saying, oh, I lost my certificate. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1946.52s)]
*  I promised you I lost it. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1949.48s)]
*  All that sort of stuff. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1951.48s)]
*  I think the killer feature [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1952.32s)]
*  was digitizing the stock certificates, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1953.14s)]
*  and then you would sign for them using an e-signature [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1955.36s)]
*  on Carta, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1959.8s)]
*  and they would just keep it for you. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1961.0s)]
*  No, I get it. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1962.2s)]
*  I'm not saying that it's, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1963.04s)]
*  I'm not debating the value, guys. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1963.88s)]
*  You're saying why is the software complicated? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1965.72s)]
*  Yeah, why is the software complicated? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1967.48s)]
*  This is not complicated. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1968.32s)]
*  Nothing you guys have said is complicated. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1969.32s)]
*  No, I don't think it's super complicated, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1971.16s)]
*  but what happened was, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1972.0s)]
*  because I remember when the market tipped, right, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1972.82s)]
*  is I got one email from a company [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1975.22s)]
*  that was using e-shares back then, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1978.6000000000001s)]
*  and I would just do the digital signature, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1980.8400000000001s)]
*  and I started getting a few more and a few more. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1983.24s)]
*  Pretty soon, there was a network effect. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1985.32s)]
*  I don't want to have to wonder [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1987.56s)]
*  where my digital stock certificates are. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1989.46s)]
*  I just know that they're all at Carta. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1992.5s)]
*  That's very convenient for me as an investor. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1994.8600000000001s)]
*  I think it's very convenient for the company [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1996.94s)]
*  to be able to manage all this stuff digitally. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=1998.46s)]
*  So look, I mean, DocuSign [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2000.14s)]
*  is not a complicated technology either, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2002.18s)]
*  and that is what, a multi-billion dollar company, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2003.98s)]
*  because there's a very strong network effect. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2006.52s)]
*  You don't want to have to have all of your signatures [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2008.02s)]
*  at a whole bunch of different companies. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2010.3s)]
*  So I think that's how I kind of got off to the races, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2012.68s)]
*  and then since then, they've been able to add more workflows. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2015.58s)]
*  They've been able to add fund management. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2019.18s)]
*  They've been able to add a number of things [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2020.9s)]
*  to make it stickier and more feature-rich, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2023.0600000000002s)]
*  and it's not that expensive. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2025.9s)]
*  It's like 10 grand a year or something like that. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2027.5400000000002s)]
*  It's kind of getting very expensive for startups. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2029.42s)]
*  We're talking- 10 grand a year is expensive? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2032.38s)]
*  I mean, for a seed-stage startup, it's a lot, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2034.74s)]
*  and then we invested in a company called Cake Equity [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2037.0800000000002s)]
*  that's doing it for like $1,000 a year. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2039.3000000000002s)]
*  To Chamath's point, you tweeted, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2041.5s)]
*  why can't this be $1,000 a year? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2043.02s)]
*  Go to Cake Equity, you'll see. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2044.6200000000001s)]
*  Can we just go to my tweet? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2046.22s)]
*  I was confused by all of this stuff, so- [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2047.62s)]
*  Well, we haven't even gotten to the story yet. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2050.14s)]
*  So just sorry, Jason, go ahead. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2051.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, sorry, Jason, go ahead. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2052.42s)]
*  So anyway, what you're hearing is [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2053.2599999999998s)]
*  this software is very integrated into startup culture. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2055.38s)]
*  We all have a lot of opinions on it [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2058.7799999999997s)]
*  because the cap table is where all the value is recorded. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2060.62s)]
*  The cap tables have gotten much more complicated, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2064.8599999999997s)]
*  but this is not like building the TikTok algorithm [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2067.46s)]
*  or ChatGPT. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2070.2999999999997s)]
*  To be clear to Chamath's point, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2071.5s)]
*  this is not really hard software to build. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2072.9s)]
*  So correct on that. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2075.84s)]
*  And Sachs, correct to your point, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2076.84s)]
*  it's super convenient if everybody uses the same platform. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2078.94s)]
*  And for a series A, B, C company [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2081.9s)]
*  spending $10,000, $20,000 a year on this [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2083.96s)]
*  is not that big of a deal, although there are cheaper options. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2085.6400000000003s)]
*  And VCs and investors use it too to track their portfolios. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2088.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2092.32s)]
*  And so- [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2093.1600000000003s)]
*  It grew from one to the other, just to be clear. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2093.98s)]
*  So I mean, first, companies started using it [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2095.2400000000002s)]
*  for their cap tables. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2098.1600000000003s)]
*  Then they got into the fund management business. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2099.08s)]
*  So if you were a fund, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2100.6400000000003s)]
*  you were receiving all of your stock certificates, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2102.36s)]
*  then you started using it to communicate with your LPs. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2104.28s)]
*  So we started doing that. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2106.6000000000004s)]
*  And it's very convenient for that. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2108.0800000000004s)]
*  So it's a real, it's more of a network effect business [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2109.44s)]
*  than a hard software business, I think is Sachs' point. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2111.76s)]
*  Totally, totally. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2113.96s)]
*  This business has benefit from the network effect. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2114.8s)]
*  So they had such strong network effects. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2118.48s)]
*  Here's the brouhaha, the Donnybrook [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2120.7200000000003s)]
*  that came up this past week. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2123.92s)]
*  Donnybrook. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2126.5600000000004s)]
*  So you can look it up. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2127.4s)]
*  I like that word. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2130.0400000000004s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2130.96s)]
*  So the company- [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2132.6800000000003s)]
*  I bet you knew a lot of Donnies in Brooklyn. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2134.36s)]
*  We, I was involved in a couple of projects, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2136.5600000000004s)]
*  if I'm being honest. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2139.1600000000003s)]
*  And they escalated from brouhaha's typically, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2140.76s)]
*  not unlike an average episode of this podcast. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2144.0800000000004s)]
*  And so- [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2146.7200000000003s)]
*  There are probably some Donnybrooks [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2147.5600000000004s)]
*  involving guys named Donny. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2148.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, Donny was typically the guy who started- [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2151.04s)]
*  Nick, this episode is gonna be named [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2152.6800000000003s)]
*  the Donnybrook episode, please. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2153.6800000000003s)]
*  So the company had a massive violation of trust [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2155.1600000000003s)]
*  as they were expanding to figure out other businesses [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2160.3999999999996s)]
*  to come into. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2163.2s)]
*  They got into what's called the secondary market. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2164.56s)]
*  For those of you who don't know [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2166.68s)]
*  what the secondary market is, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2167.52s)]
*  people like to trade stocks of private companies. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2169.12s)]
*  You may have heard people buying and selling [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2171.7999999999997s)]
*  Stripe or SpaceX. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2173.64s)]
*  And so employees, early investors [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2175.56s)]
*  might sell their shares to other people. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2177.68s)]
*  Now this is not happening as a primary offering [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2179.3199999999997s)]
*  from the company where they raise money [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2181.64s)]
*  and issue new shares. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2183.04s)]
*  This is people who have shares. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2184.2s)]
*  Carta was in a great position to do this [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2185.92s)]
*  because they had the cap table. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2187.8799999999997s)]
*  Now on your cap table might be 100 investors. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2189.44s)]
*  30 of them might be your friends, family, very quiet. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2192.64s)]
*  Could be Jeff Bezos who was a seed investor in Google. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2196.4s)]
*  Some folks at Carta who were in the secondary business [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2200.6800000000003s)]
*  violated the trust and the privacy of companies [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2204.32s)]
*  who had angel investors or early stage investors [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2207.84s)]
*  on their cap table and started contacting them directly [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2210.28s)]
*  saying, hey, do you wanna sell your shares in company A [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2213.2000000000003s)]
*  to this person? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2216.4s)]
*  They're trying to create a market for it. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2217.22s)]
*  They got called out publicly, the CEO Henry Ward [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2219.7799999999997s)]
*  who is a unique individual as many CEOs are, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2223.62s)]
*  tried to do some comms. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2229.2599999999998s)]
*  It was a disaster of comms for a couple of days [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2230.54s)]
*  while they tried to explain [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2233.54s)]
*  basically breaking their own terms of service. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2235.2599999999998s)]
*  And it all ended up with them selling [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2238.2599999999998s)]
*  the secondary business, which I understand [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2241.22s)]
*  was a tiny business for them. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2242.8199999999997s)]
*  Overall, your thoughts gentlemen. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2244.9399999999996s)]
*  Why did you say he was an interesting individual? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2247.38s)]
*  He communicates directly in a very effervescent, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2250.54s)]
*  candid way, like some founders do. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2256.42s)]
*  Effervescent, wow, that's a nice. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2259.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm just trying to- [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2263.2200000000003s)]
*  What I was saying, he's sparkling? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2264.06s)]
*  I think he is bad at PR, but entertaining to listen to. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2266.86s)]
*  I think maybe they should have had a little bit [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2272.1200000000003s)]
*  of a slightly more thoughtful approach to this, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2274.38s)]
*  but it all happened in real time. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2276.94s)]
*  So it's very difficult to deal with the crisis [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2278.1s)]
*  in real time, I think. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2279.6600000000003s)]
*  I have two comments. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2280.48s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2281.7000000000003s)]
*  The first is I actually disagree with David Sachs. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2283.46s)]
*  I think that there's literally no concept of network effects [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2286.02s)]
*  in this business and it makes no sense here. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2289.94s)]
*  And the reason is that when you look at the public markets, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2292.98s)]
*  which are infinitely larger, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2295.02s)]
*  we have a vibrant public stock market [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2297.5s)]
*  that has no concept of this and it works. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2299.42s)]
*  Where you have companies like ComputerShares, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2301.58s)]
*  you have companies like SSNC. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2305.06s)]
*  There's just a plethora of providers [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2307.58s)]
*  that do fund administration. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2310.02s)]
*  And frankly, I'm glad that there's a plethora of providers. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2311.74s)]
*  I use some of them and I trade one against the other [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2313.86s)]
*  to get a constantly cheaper price. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2316.96s)]
*  We use the distribution agents. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2319.38s)]
*  And depending on which bank I'm working with [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2322.98s)]
*  on whatever deal, I have shares [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2325.2999999999997s)]
*  at multiple different agents. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2327.22s)]
*  And they also cost virtually nothing. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2329.22s)]
*  And I don't see a world where [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2331.74s)]
*  that deflationary cost reduction [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2334.9399999999996s)]
*  doesn't come to this market either, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2337.3799999999997s)]
*  because I don't see this as a defensible area of software. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2338.72s)]
*  I think it's a necessary piece of software. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2342.14s)]
*  So I kind of like randomly tweeted out, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2345.3399999999997s)]
*  just kind of like, oh, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2348.02s)]
*  because I was just watching from the sidelines. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2349.02s)]
*  Now in full disclosure, I was a Carta investor. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2350.56s)]
*  I sold all my equity in a secondary transaction actually. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2354.18s)]
*  Speaking of secondary transactions, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2357.02s)]
*  was that a good trade? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2358.94s)]
*  Yeah, I sold it all two and a half years ago. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2360.02s)]
*  So I have no opinion one way or the other on this company. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2363.02s)]
*  I understand process automation, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2365.2999999999997s)]
*  but I don't think process automation is defensible. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2367.74s)]
*  So if you build software around process automation, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2371.12s)]
*  you will be competing in a race to the bottom on price. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2373.8599999999997s)]
*  That is, and I have not seen a single example [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2377.52s)]
*  of a company that's proven this otherwise. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2380.46s)]
*  There are different companies that create real lock-in [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2382.06s)]
*  because of what they build. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2385.46s)]
*  That isn't one. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2386.3599999999997s)]
*  So I tweeted this out. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2388.12s)]
*  Some person sent me this and Jason, to your point, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2389.3599999999997s)]
*  the two most prevalent competitors that they showed me [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2391.64s)]
*  were Mantle and Pully. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2394.72s)]
*  I think one is a YC company and one is not, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2397.3199999999997s)]
*  but Mantle and Pully, I think were the two [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2400.24s)]
*  that came up the most often. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2402.3999999999996s)]
*  And Jason, to your point, what they both told me [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2403.72s)]
*  was Carta is like 10K a year, 12K a year, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2407.0s)]
*  and these guys are 90% discounted at, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2410.2s)]
*  a 10th of the price, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2412.52s)]
*  which again proves there is not a lot [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2414.44s)]
*  of super compelling software lock in here. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2417.2000000000003s)]
*  It's useful stuff, but that useful stuff [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2420.08s)]
*  is eventually gonna get as close to free as possible. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2422.8s)]
*  These guys are proving it. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2425.52s)]
*  And then last night, while we were at poker, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2426.7200000000003s)]
*  I got this thing, somebody in two days, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2428.64s)]
*  oh, built an open source competitor [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2432.2400000000002s)]
*  and just put the code out there and said, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2435.04s)]
*  here you go, take it. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2436.52s)]
*  Isn't that incredible? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2438.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2439.68s)]
*  Guys, that happened in two days from that tweet. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2440.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2444.6s)]
*  And by the way, I don't know, if I got- [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2445.92s)]
*  How crazy is that? [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2447.6s)]
*  If I got a stock certificate from, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2448.88s)]
*  what's the name of this thing? [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2450.64s)]
*  Open source clone. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2453.04s)]
*  Byebyecarta.com, I'd like groan. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2454.48s)]
*  I'd be like, oh, here we go. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2456.96s)]
*  I've gotta like find my- [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2458.6s)]
*  Okay, first of all, that's totally not true. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2459.84s)]
*  Find my certs in like five different sites [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2461.68s)]
*  and this thing's probably gonna go out of business [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2463.2s)]
*  in six months. Come on, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2464.56s)]
*  that's not true and you know it. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2465.7999999999997s)]
*  You know it. You don't know where the certs are. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2467.0s)]
*  I can actually- You don't care. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2468.72s)]
*  It's gonna be a seriously annoying type of deal [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2469.72s)]
*  with something new. I can actually tell you [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2471.64s)]
*  what's happening in the market with startups. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2473.0s)]
*  Startups are looking at the alternatives. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2474.68s)]
*  They wanna save money. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2476.48s)]
*  The bigger companies are probably [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2477.92s)]
*  not as price sensitive, Chamath. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2480.0s)]
*  So, you know, spending $20,000 as a series B company, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2481.24s)]
*  nobody cares. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2484.7599999999998s)]
*  But for the startups, they tend to find [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2485.84s)]
*  the most efficient software and [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2488.7999999999997s)]
*  you're exactly right, Chamath, on that. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2490.84s)]
*  Yeah, my comment is less about Carta itself [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2492.7999999999997s)]
*  and its price point. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2496.7999999999997s)]
*  My observation is twofold. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2497.76s)]
*  One is software that doesn't have a fundamental lock-in [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2500.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2504.1600000000003s)]
*  does not have pricing power, number one. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2505.5200000000004s)]
*  And number two, we are almost at the tipping point [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2508.4s)]
*  of a set of tools that will allow competitors [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2511.48s)]
*  in a matter of days to compete with an 80% [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2514.5200000000004s)]
*  feature complete solution at a fraction of the price. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2516.96s)]
*  That's my generalized observation as manifested [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2519.6000000000004s)]
*  in this Carta example in less than a week. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2523.36s)]
*  Well, what do you do with some observation like this? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2526.2799999999997s)]
*  If you have this 80% observation, is there anything you could? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2528.04s)]
*  So then I was like, well, you know what? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2530.08s)]
*  I'm just gonna go for it. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2531.52s)]
*  So I'm starting this thing [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2532.72s)]
*  and I've been working on this idea for a little bit, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2537.12s)]
*  and I've been experimenting with it [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2539.2799999999997s)]
*  with some of my companies, but then I was like, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2541.4399999999996s)]
*  you know what, we should just do this. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2542.9599999999996s)]
*  So the concept here is we're gonna build this incubator. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2544.0s)]
*  It's called 8090. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2547.24s)]
*  I have a team. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2548.2799999999997s)]
*  I have a bunch of developers offshore [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2550.12s)]
*  and we are going to basically create a hit list [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2551.88s)]
*  of software that we think is relatively straightforward [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2557.1600000000003s)]
*  and mispriced and could be built much more efficiently [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2560.92s)]
*  in 2024 using all of these co-pilots and tools. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2563.92s)]
*  And our boundary conditions will be, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2567.92s)]
*  can we deliver 80% of the functionality [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2571.0s)]
*  at 10% of the price? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2574.0s)]
*  So at a 90% discount. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2575.2400000000002s)]
*  So 8090 is like sort of where you go. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2577.76s)]
*  8090 is what the name of the incubator is. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2579.6s)]
*  And what was interesting is when I tweeted this out, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2582.16s)]
*  we had 1200 people essentially give us a product roadmap. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2584.4s)]
*  They told us the software that they would want. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2589.12s)]
*  They told us the features that they need. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2591.0s)]
*  They told us the things that they don't need. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2592.56s)]
*  And so the idea here, Jason, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2593.68s)]
*  I think is I'm just gonna build this in the wild. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2595.68s)]
*  I'll create the list of companies. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2598.16s)]
*  We'll publish that out, let people vote on it. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2600.64s)]
*  Then we'll publish the PRDs of what the 80% version is [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2602.96s)]
*  and we're gonna work backwards with my team in South Asia [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2606.8s)]
*  to try to build these things at a 10% price point. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2612.28s)]
*  So Sachs, your thoughts, you're a SaaS investor. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2615.1600000000003s)]
*  You're vertical. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2618.5600000000004s)]
*  Your thoughts on Chamath's plan to be the most hated person [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2619.7200000000003s)]
*  in Silicon Valley by under pricing every piece [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2622.5200000000004s)]
*  of SaaS software by 90% in real time. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2626.5200000000004s)]
*  Can he do it in your estimation? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2630.6400000000003s)]
*  I think there probably are categories [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2632.6800000000003s)]
*  where you could do that. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2634.5200000000004s)]
*  But in general, what I would say is that it always [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2636.12s)]
*  looks easier from the outside than from the inside. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2640.7999999999997s)]
*  Meaning that you look at any particular SaaS category leader [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2644.12s)]
*  and you're like, this is easy. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2648.44s)]
*  Like I could do this. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2650.3599999999997s)]
*  And then when you actually get into it, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2651.3199999999997s)]
*  you realize that, okay, the product I'm seeing [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2652.8399999999997s)]
*  is kind of an iceberg. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2655.6s)]
*  I'm just seeing the tip of the iceberg. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2656.72s)]
*  Below the waterline is all the business logic [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2658.3199999999997s)]
*  that's been written into the system. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2660.48s)]
*  There's like a much deeper and longer list of features. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2661.96s)]
*  Not in every category. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2665.4s)]
*  You might be right that in some categories, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2666.32s)]
*  you don't need the product depth. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2667.84s)]
*  But in many other categories, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2669.7200000000003s)]
*  there's just a lot of subtle features, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2671.2400000000002s)]
*  usability issues have been figured out, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2673.2400000000002s)]
*  integrations with other- [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2674.8s)]
*  Ongoing support. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2678.0s)]
*  Ongoing support. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2679.2000000000003s)]
*  Training. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2680.28s)]
*  And then you have the whole sales [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2681.1200000000003s)]
*  and marketing component to it. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2681.96s)]
*  So what ends up happening is you attack a category saying, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2683.28s)]
*  oh, this is gonna be easy. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2686.84s)]
*  A year or two into it, you're like, wow. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2688.96s)]
*  The category leader we're not even close to [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2691.36s)]
*  where it is in terms of table stakes here. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2694.4s)]
*  And it ends up being more of a slog than you thought. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2696.48s)]
*  And then you find out the market doesn't necessarily have [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2699.48s)]
*  as much of an incentive to switch. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2701.64s)]
*  I'm not saying it can't be done. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2703.2000000000003s)]
*  There are categories where I think [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2705.4s)]
*  the category leaders become stagnant [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2707.76s)]
*  and has stopped innovating. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2710.12s)]
*  And I think those are ripe for disruption. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2711.32s)]
*  I mean, look, I'm kind of trying in a way [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2714.08s)]
*  we're gonna be launching my Slack killer soon. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2715.6800000000003s)]
*  I feel a lot better about that because Slack I'd acquired [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2719.32s)]
*  hasn't really innovated in a few years. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2722.12s)]
*  And Salesforce, by the way, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2724.96s)]
*  just announced zero hiring in 2024. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2725.7999999999997s)]
*  And the Slack teams were like, what? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2728.2s)]
*  How are we supposed to hit our roadmap without more people? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2730.0s)]
*  Like what's going on here? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2732.4s)]
*  So there is that. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2733.4s)]
*  I definitely think it can be done, but I don't know. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2735.16s)]
*  I think you gotta choose carefully the categories [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2738.64s)]
*  where the iceberg isn't bigger than you think basically. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2741.56s)]
*  Do you think that there's a shift in the business model [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2745.72s)]
*  for SaaS companies that emerges [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2747.96s)]
*  from what Jamal is talking about? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2750.3199999999997s)]
*  Where I think right now sales and marketing cost [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2752.52s)]
*  is a percent of revenue on average [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2754.56s)]
*  for a scaling enterprise software company [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2756.36s)]
*  around 55% of revenue or something in that range. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2758.48s)]
*  Does that number get compressed by bringing price down? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2762.4s)]
*  So you bring price down, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2766.0s)]
*  but you need fewer people to go in and do the selling. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2767.0s)]
*  Fewer folks do marketing. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2769.88s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2770.72s)]
*  I mean, that has not been the pattern. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2771.56s)]
*  I mean, look, everyone was saying things like this [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2772.88s)]
*  when enterprise software shifted from on-prem to the cloud. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2775.48s)]
*  You know, when we went from Oracle and Siebel [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2778.68s)]
*  to Salesforce.com, people would say, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2781.16s)]
*  oh, this is gonna fundamentally change the business. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2783.8399999999997s)]
*  Sales won't become that important. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2785.88s)]
*  Product's gonna be all important. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2787.48s)]
*  It was true to some degree. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2789.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, I do think that- [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2790.68s)]
*  You tried to do it. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2791.52s)]
*  That was what you pioneered at Yammer. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2792.3599999999997s)]
*  You tried to do bottom-up sales. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2794.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so there was product-led growth became a thing. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2795.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2798.4s)]
*  And a very important thing. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2799.24s)]
*  And I still think that's the best way [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2800.3599999999997s)]
*  to build a SaaS company is you let the users just try it [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2801.88s)]
*  on a freemium basis as opposed to having sales [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2805.08s)]
*  knock on the CIO's door, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2807.96s)]
*  let the employees pull the product into the company, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2809.24s)]
*  then go close the deal. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2812.2799999999997s)]
*  So it did make important changes, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2813.72s)]
*  but it did not get rid of sales. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2815.4399999999996s)]
*  I mean, you know, what I believe doing this stuff way back [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2817.3199999999997s)]
*  in 2008 is we'd be able to get rid of sales [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2820.7599999999998s)]
*  and just make enterprise products completely [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2822.6s)]
*  self-distributing. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2825.48s)]
*  That never happened. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2826.2999999999997s)]
*  People have been predicting the death of sales [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2827.3999999999996s)]
*  for a long time and it's never happened. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2829.68s)]
*  I think your vision is absolutely right. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2831.64s)]
*  And I think this, in a world of auto GPTs, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2833.4399999999996s)]
*  it's going to happen. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2836.2s)]
*  And I think the way that it's roughly gonna happen [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2837.08s)]
*  is as follows. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2839.96s)]
*  I think what happens is that, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2840.7999999999997s)]
*  and Zoho is another good example of how you can do this, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2841.84s)]
*  which is what you need are a small set of tools [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2844.64s)]
*  that provide useful capability for a company [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2847.88s)]
*  that work elegantly together. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2850.92s)]
*  Now, when you work elegantly together, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2852.72s)]
*  there's a bunch of things that you need. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2854.44s)]
*  You need security, you need handoffs and handshakes, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2855.7599999999998s)]
*  you need different ways of handling exceptions, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2858.2s)]
*  you need a common kind of data model. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2860.7999999999997s)]
*  All of those things can actually be configured [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2864.7599999999998s)]
*  on the fly dynamically by and between two sets of software [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2866.92s)]
*  if you let the AI actually run and auto configure itself. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2871.7200000000003s)]
*  And so I think the experimentation is as follows. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2874.7200000000003s)]
*  You have product A and product B, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2878.1s)]
*  you want to adopt them both. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2879.6s)]
*  They have elements of an agent [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2880.96s)]
*  that can go and auto configure themselves to each other. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2883.2400000000002s)]
*  Separately, I think what the CFO or the CEO does [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2885.7000000000003s)]
*  is allocate a budget. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2890.44s)]
*  And that budget is an agent. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2892.32s)]
*  And what that agent does is it works with these other agents [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2894.6s)]
*  to say, okay, great, I can spend money on these features. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2897.08s)]
*  That is a thing we've not explored. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2900.2799999999997s)]
*  We've always taken software that we build [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2901.84s)]
*  and all of a sudden pause automation [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2905.0s)]
*  and hand it over to people to run it through [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2907.52s)]
*  a relatively archaic go-to-market process. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2910.64s)]
*  And I think what's worth trying to figure out [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2913.4s)]
*  in 2024 and beyond is how to use these tools [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2915.64s)]
*  to automate all of the low level negotiation that happens [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2919.02s)]
*  before you can adopt software. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2922.52s)]
*  I just think it's totally unnecessary. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2923.88s)]
*  And I think that this is where software can do [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2926.44s)]
*  a very powerful job on behalf of the salesperson. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2929.52s)]
*  Does it mean the salesperson is totally out of the loop? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2932.08s)]
*  No, but I do think that if these tools are lightweight enough, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2934.98s)]
*  especially the young, nimble companies, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2938.88s)]
*  will actually say, great, my procurement person [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2941.88s)]
*  is actually an AI agent with a budget. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2944.84s)]
*  And it's the products that then figure out [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2947.56s)]
*  how to negotiate for the share of that budget [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2949.4s)]
*  and then configure how to work amongst itself. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2951.56s)]

*  that I think someone will figure out. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2957.1200000000003s)]
*  That is the Zoho 2.0, right? [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2958.76s)]
*  That is the Salesforce 2.0. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2962.1200000000003s)]
*  It's sort of this app, app store, common data bus [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2964.36s)]
*  kind of an idea that I think somebody will build. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2967.48s)]
*  I would like to try to help. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2970.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, people have started building in Chamath [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2971.84s)]
*  because you're starting to see the features overlap [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2974.28s)]
*  in many programs. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2976.5200000000004s)]
*  You're seeing HubSpot, Salesforce, Zendesk. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2977.36s)]
*  They're all kind of getting into each other's businesses. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2979.6800000000003s)]
*  I think that's a good observation, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2982.32s)]
*  but those are all closed products. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2983.1600000000003s)]
*  What I mean is like, there is like a totally open protocol [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2985.2400000000002s)]
*  and set of standards for how product A integrates [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2989.88s)]
*  and interacts with product B on many levels, right? [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2993.1200000000003s)]
*  From security to data model and everything in between. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2997.04s)]
*  And I think that that is what needs to get figured out [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2999.6800000000003s)]
*  and be very much an open source idea. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3001.96s)]
*  The great part about this is, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3004.7200000000003s)]
*  this is gonna be massive competition. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3005.92s)]
*  It will lower prices, it'll add features [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3007.6400000000003s)]
*  and the team over at 37 signals is doing something similar. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3009.84s)]
*  If you look at once.com, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3013.88s)]
*  they are also gonna go after Slack, Saks, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3015.8s)]
*  and they're gonna just charge one time for the software. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3018.96s)]
*  I think I may have mentioned it on a previous one, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3021.32s)]
*  but their concept is- [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3022.92s)]
*  Yeah, you did. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3023.76s)]
*  Yeah, just- [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3024.6000000000004s)]
*  My gosh, can we take a moment actually, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3025.42s)]
*  Nick, can you throw up my tweet? [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3028.44s)]
*  Can you take a moment to just say thank you [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3029.48s)]
*  to Stuart Butterfield and what he pulled off? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3032.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3035.88s)]
*  As a series A investor, I thank you so much. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3036.7200000000003s)]
*  27 times ARR is looking like a pretty great exit multiple. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3039.36s)]
*  Oh, there's my reply. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3044.84s)]
*  Oh yeah, look at my reply. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3045.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3047.3s)]
*  I mean, my gosh. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3048.1400000000003s)]
*  What a deal. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3050.52s)]
*  And at the time it was, they were public [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3051.92s)]
*  and people were wondering like, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3054.44s)]
*  hmm, was this a good deal or not? [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3055.6800000000003s)]
*  Should they have stayed independent? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3057.7200000000003s)]
*  But the product velocity- [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3058.88s)]
*  Savvr seemed to get going. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3060.4s)]
*  How are you thinking about what the critical [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3062.2000000000003s)]
*  go-to-market MVP capability is for Slack? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3067.3199999999997s)]
*  So this year's what I'm curious about. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3070.2s)]
*  There's chat, right? [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3073.3199999999997s)]
*  But the problem with chat in my opinion [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3077.16s)]
*  is that Slack has become totally overrun [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3079.3999999999996s)]
*  where you could be a five person company [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3081.48s)]
*  and all of a sudden you have 500 channels. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3082.96s)]
*  So there's no scarcity. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3084.8399999999997s)]
*  And that scarcity is in my opinion, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3086.3599999999997s)]
*  what makes all corporate chats in this modern version, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3088.3199999999997s)]
*  teams included, totally unusable, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3092.52s)]
*  so much noise and distraction. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3095.12s)]
*  So how are you thinking about that product problem? [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3097.24s)]
*  I totally agree with that. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3100.24s)]
*  What you hear from every single company [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3101.7599999999998s)]
*  that has more than, I don't know, 50 employees [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3103.64s)]
*  is that Slack doesn't scale. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3107.36s)]
*  Because what happens is you have a channel get created [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3109.2799999999997s)]
*  and there's a whole bunch of conversations in there [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3113.2799999999997s)]
*  that are kind of munched together. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3115.98s)]
*  If anybody in the company wants to participate [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3117.52s)]
*  in any one of those conversations, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3119.3199999999997s)]
*  they have to join that entire channel. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3120.92s)]
*  And as a result, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3123.2799999999997s)]
*  every single employee ends up in every single channel. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3124.12s)]
*  And it's just a giant mess and there's way too much noise. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3126.56s)]
*  So I think that the channel model was beautiful [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3129.56s)]
*  in terms of letting people get started really easily. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3132.56s)]
*  You just jump into a channel and start posting. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3135.3599999999997s)]
*  That's why it took off. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3137.24s)]
*  But it's not particular enough [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3138.58s)]
*  in terms of addressing conversations to the right people. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3140.9s)]
*  So that's basically one of the problems that we're fixing. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3145.8199999999997s)]
*  The other thing I've heard from people is that we love chat [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3149.02s)]
*  but we also really like the feed that Yammer had [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3151.84s)]
*  as a way to quickly scroll through new stuff. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3154.88s)]
*  So we're giving that people too. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3157.1600000000003s)]
*  You have top level corporate feed. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3158.0s)]
*  People forget that. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3159.0s)]
*  There was like this, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3159.84s)]
*  hey, if you want to get the pulse of the entire organization [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3160.6800000000003s)]
*  go to this one corporate feed. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3163.04s)]
*  We were the first ones to figure out [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3164.88s)]
*  that a feed should be used inside of an enterprise [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3166.1000000000004s)]
*  not just in a consumer social network. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3169.32s)]
*  So in any event, I'd say those are two of the main concepts [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3171.28s)]
*  is combining feed and chat in a way [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3174.84s)]
*  that actually makes sense and solving the noise, [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3177.04s)]
*  the signal noise problem. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3180.32s)]
*  And then the next thing I want to do is [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3182.48s)]
*  I want to make sure that people are able to get [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3184.08s)]
*  the right feedback. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3186.2s)]
*  So I'm going to go ahead and start with you, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3187.04s)]
*  I'm going to start with you. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3189.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm going to start with you, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3190.12s)]
*  I'm going to start with you, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3190.96s)]
*  and I'm going to start with you. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3191.96s)]
*  Do you have a name for it yet? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3192.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to be called Glu. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3194.24s)]
*  Ooh, I love that. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3196.24s)]
*  Can I remind you that as a humble investor, sir, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3197.08s)]
*  I think I was part of Yammer and Slack, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3202.08s)]
*  so I can add value. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3205.04s)]
*  You're in, you're in. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3208.2s)]
*  I'll take 250, 500K. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3209.64s)]
*  Lock me in first place. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3211.44s)]
*  I'll take 500. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3213.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, so I think what we're going to do [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3214.72s)]
*  is before launch, we'll do like a seed round. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3215.56s)]
*  Nice. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3218.72s)]
*  Right now it's all been incubated by Kraft, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3219.56s)]
*  so we'll do a seed round. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3220.4s)]
*  What about a first seed round before the seed round? [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3221.56s)]
*  So like 50 million. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3223.72s)]
*  So like six million posts, six posts? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3224.56s)]
*  I'll put 50 in at six pre. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3226.72s)]
*  56 posts. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3229.7999999999997s)]
*  50K? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3230.64s)]
*  It's not that cheap, but it won't be [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3231.48s)]
*  a super expensive round, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3232.7999999999997s)]
*  because what we want to do is incentivize, you know, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3233.7999999999997s)]
*  influencers to like support the product, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3237.32s)]
*  switch to the product. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3239.6000000000004s)]
*  So it really is going to be- [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3240.92s)]
*  Do you have glue.com? [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3242.52s)]
*  We have glue.ai. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3244.84s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3246.6800000000003s)]
*  Nice. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3248.0s)]
*  I was going to get 8090.ai, but then I didn't like it. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3248.84s)]
*  You know what I got instead? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3252.0s)]
*  Tell me if you like this. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3253.04s)]

*  Yeah, that's fine. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3258.4s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3259.2400000000002s)]
*  Everybody searches. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3260.0800000000004s)]
*  I mean, eventually you fake it till you make it. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3260.9s)]
*  If the 8090 domain happens, you get it, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3262.8s)]
*  or you put get or go 8090.com. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3265.24s)]
*  So do that before the show gets published. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3267.7999999999997s)]
*  What is it? [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3269.72s)]
*  Get or go? [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3270.56s)]
*  Like if people have an app- [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3271.3999999999996s)]
*  Oh, get 8090. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3272.24s)]
*  Get 8090 or go 8090. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3273.08s)]
*  So, you know, if it's a service, you say go 8090. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3275.7599999999998s)]
*  And if it's whatever you say, get, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3278.3199999999997s)]
*  if it's an app or something, right? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3280.04s)]
*  Like you're just going to go get it here [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3281.2799999999997s)]
*  at this domain name. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3282.8399999999997s)]
*  It's just easier to remember. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3283.68s)]
*  I also got vcsasgoboom.com. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3284.52s)]
*  Oh, excellent. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3288.0s)]
*  Well, I have wet your- [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3288.8399999999997s)]
*  People don't remember this for a callback. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3289.8399999999997s)]
*  I have wetyourbeak.com. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3291.2s)]
*  I think it just goes to- [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3293.16s)]
*  Wetyourbeak.com just goes to our website. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3294.64s)]
*  So that, I mean, that was the basic scandal. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3297.0s)]
*  Saks, they let the sales team doing secondary, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3300.4s)]
*  apparently, or somebody broke a rule. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3304.3199999999997s)]
*  They weren't exactly clear with it. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3306.16s)]
*  It sounded to me like, you know, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3308.4s)]
*  they didn't want to throw anybody under the bus exactly. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3310.36s)]
*  But how big of a violation is it to let people [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3314.64s)]
*  go sell into the cap table, secondary shares, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3317.64s)]
*  without the CEO or your customer even knowing [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3321.9s)]
*  that you access that data? [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3324.04s)]
*  Where would you put that on a violation of trust scale? [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3325.04s)]
*  Saks. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3327.84s)]
*  I think it was a huge issue for them [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3328.68s)]
*  because the only reason startups give their data to Carta [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3329.64s)]
*  is because they trust them to keep it private. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3333.7599999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3336.12s)]
*  And I think a big part of the problem [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3336.96s)]
*  with the Carta vision of creating the secondary marketplace [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3338.12s)]
*  is that founders don't want it. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3341.84s)]
*  Fundamentally, that's the problem. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3343.16s)]
*  I mean, Carta is in the perfect position [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3344.68s)]
*  to rationalize and make liquid the secondary market. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3347.44s)]
*  The vision was correct in that sense. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3351.52s)]
*  And the reason for that is because Carta [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3354.04s)]
*  not only has the cap table [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3356.32s)]
*  and they know who all the investors are, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3358.2s)]
*  they also have all the documents. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3359.6s)]
*  They got all of your corporate documents, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3361.04s)]
*  the bylaws, all that kind of stuff. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3362.3s)]
*  They can very easily execute these transactions. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3363.68s)]
*  So Carta was in a great position [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3367.42s)]
*  to replace all of these secondary brokers [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3369.52s)]
*  who are running around creating books on their own. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3371.24s)]
*  The problem they have is that at the end of the day, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3374.52s)]
*  founders don't really want secondary markets [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3377.04s)]
*  to take place in their company's shares. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3379.56s)]
*  And I think there's a few reasons for that. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3382.96s)]
*  One is price discovery. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3384.6s)]
*  I think a lot of these startups now, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3387.12s)]
*  if their shares were to be freely traded, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3388.7999999999997s)]
*  would be trading below. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3391.2999999999997s)]
*  Bad timing. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3392.7599999999998s)]
*  Below the last round's mark, so they don't want it. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3394.18s)]
*  Second, the founders don't necessarily [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3397.12s)]
*  want their investors getting out [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3399.88s)]
*  and then getting new investors on the cap table [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3401.36s)]
*  that they don't know. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3403.36s)]
*  So founders are somewhat particular [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3404.7599999999998s)]
*  about who their shareholders are. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3406.52s)]
*  It's different than public companies in that way. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3408.08s)]
*  Apple doesn't really care who its shareholders are. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3410.56s)]
*  Private companies do care. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3413.2s)]
*  Do you think that that's sustainable in a world [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3414.24s)]
*  where companies take 14 or 15 years [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3415.96s)]
*  and they're trying to retain talent? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3417.96s)]
*  Well, I think it would be better for everybody [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3420.68s)]
*  if there was more organized liquidity. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3422.72s)]
*  One of the things I love that SpaceX has done [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3425.32s)]
*  is that for the last number of years now, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3428.56s)]
*  they've had a tender offer every year. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3430.6s)]
*  Not even every year, almost every quarter. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3433.0s)]
*  It's every six months, I think, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3434.8s)]
*  was what my understanding of it is. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3436.24s)]
*  It would be good for the company. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3438.3599999999997s)]
*  But think about that example. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3439.2s)]
*  With SpaceX, it's been up and to the right [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3440.64s)]
*  on a pretty consistent basis. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3442.68s)]
*  Every tender round has been a bump. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3444.3599999999997s)]
*  Sometimes it's been a small bump, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3447.3999999999996s)]
*  sometimes it's been a larger bump. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3448.56s)]
*  The company, I don't think, has gotten greedy. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3450.7599999999998s)]
*  So they haven't tried to shoot the moon [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3453.08s)]
*  and raise the valuation too much. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3455.3199999999997s)]
*  So they've been able to keep a very organized process. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3457.04s)]
*  They've had this attitude from the beginning [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3459.2799999999997s)]
*  of letting their employees and investors [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3460.8399999999997s)]
*  get liquidity when they need to. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3463.8799999999997s)]
*  So it's been great. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3465.16s)]
*  But that's very different. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3466.24s)]
*  By the way, that organized tender process [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3468.34s)]
*  is very different than the secondary market [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3469.98s)]
*  that Carta was organizing. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3472.54s)]
*  Because Carta was trying to do [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3474.62s)]
*  what all these secondary brokers are doing, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3476.74s)]
*  which is they hit up people one at a time [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3478.54s)]
*  and just say, are you looking to buy or sell? [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3480.62s)]
*  They're trying to organize secondary transactions [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3482.18s)]
*  that are not part of an official process. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3485.14s)]
*  And I think that's a huge part of the problem here. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3487.98s)]
*  Freiburg, did you have thoughts on it? [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3491.7s)]
*  Well, there's an element of secondary transactions [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3493.22s)]
*  in private companies that are unstructured, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3497.14s)]
*  generally being a problem. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3499.06s)]
*  The issue with Carta was, was there a violation of trust [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3500.7799999999997s)]
*  with respect to the transparency onto the cap table [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3503.2599999999998s)]
*  that they have access to [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3505.8199999999997s)]
*  because they have all the data in their systems? [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3506.9s)]
*  And when I was at Google in 04 or so, [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3509.56s)]
*  Sergey was kind of throwing around the idea, [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3514.18s)]
*  why don't we start a hedge fund? [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3519.5s)]
*  Because we have all this data [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3520.66s)]
*  about what people are searching for [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3521.8199999999997s)]
*  and we can see all of this consumer behavior. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3523.1s)]
*  And we could trade on that [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3525.6s)]
*  and have a huge data advantage in the marketplace. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3526.6s)]
*  And ultimately, whether or not there was an impropriety [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3529.88s)]
*  of the use of data, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3535.48s)]
*  and even if we excluded personal data and search data, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3536.78s)]
*  just using internet-based traffic and internet data, [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3539.24s)]
*  the perception of the problem [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3541.8s)]
*  would have damaged Google's brand so much. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3543.78s)]
*  First of all, is there an actual conflict [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3546.24s)]
*  where you're taking people's, [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3547.64s)]
*  what they consider to be private data [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3548.92s)]
*  and using that to make money from their data [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3550.7599999999998s)]
*  without their permission or acknowledgement [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3553.64s)]
*  or explicit consent? [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3556.36s)]
*  And secondly, even if you are doing this in a way [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3557.48s)]
*  that doesn't use their data [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3560.2000000000003s)]
*  because you just generally have knowledge [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3561.28s)]
*  about who buyers and sellers are in the market, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3562.6s)]
*  outside of your software, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3565.36s)]
*  the view that you may be using the data in conflict [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3566.84s)]
*  can damage your brand [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3570.8s)]
*  and damage your customer relationships so much. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3571.8s)]
*  So it seems in hindsight a little silly, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3574.44s)]
*  but I think to Chamath's point earlier, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3576.56s)]
*  it may indicate the necessity for them to think about [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3578.6s)]
*  building another business [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3580.92s)]
*  on top of this core software business [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3581.96s)]
*  that is a more true marketplace-driven business [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3583.9s)]
*  so they can make over time more money, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3586.5s)]
*  and that's probably where this all came from. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3588.52s)]
*  They saw a need to build something [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3590.06s)]
*  that was more than just monthly subscription fees. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3592.1400000000003s)]
*  And the truth is, they weren't making money from it, [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3594.02s)]
*  and they shut it down. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3596.1800000000003s)]
*  It's true that Carta is trying [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3597.94s)]
*  to become a multi-product business. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3600.58s)]
*  They started with start cap tables, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3602.2200000000003s)]
*  then they added fund management, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3604.98s)]
*  then they added this broker business. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3606.26s)]
*  But if you read Henry's last blog, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3608.1s)]
*  the secondary market is what he originally wanted [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3610.58s)]
*  to disrupt, is he always wanted [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3613.38s)]
*  to create the secondary market, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3615.62s)]
*  and he created the cap table business, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3617.6600000000003s)]
*  the SaaS software, as a way to get to that. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3619.7000000000003s)]
*  I think what he's realized is that the real value [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3622.9s)]
*  is in the SaaS software, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3625.12s)]
*  and this marketplace is not that valuable. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3626.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean, the SaaS business is doing something [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3628.78s)]
*  like 250 million a year of revenue, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3630.94s)]
*  and the broker business is only doing a few million, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3633.48s)]
*  yeah, three million. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3635.76s)]
*  So I think the value has turned out to be in the SaaS, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3636.6400000000003s)]
*  and moreover, this broker business was compromising [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3639.0s)]
*  the trust and safety, or the perception of trust [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3642.84s)]
*  that the company has from customers. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3646.6800000000003s)]
*  The problem with that SaaS revenue is [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3649.1600000000003s)]
*  if you look at Mantle and Pulley, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3650.6800000000003s)]
*  that 250 million could be 25 million. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3653.1600000000003s)]
*  And Cake, my investment, yeah. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3656.4s)]
*  And Cake, sorry, yeah, and Cake. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3658.6800000000003s)]
*  But the point is, the fact that there are many competitors, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3660.8s)]
*  I think is a sign of a low barrier to entry, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3665.08s)]
*  and a lack of a true fundamental lock-in. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3669.0s)]
*  Let's say you are an investor [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3671.68s)]
*  and you're looking at Pulley or Mantle. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3673.3599999999997s)]
*  Why would you even think that's an attractive company [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3675.0s)]
*  to invest in if success looks like [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3677.68s)]
*  you're compressing a $250 million market down to 25 million? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3680.8599999999997s)]
*  Like, what's the point? [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3684.16s)]
*  I think a lot of these competitors got funded [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3685.2s)]
*  during the whole Zerp era, where everything got funded. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3687.48s)]
*  I mean, if you were to look at that market today, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3690.16s)]
*  why would you even fund a disruptor? [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3693.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, so look, I think Mantle's race- [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3695.06s)]
*  Well, there are other strategies, too. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3697.3999999999996s)]
*  There's other strategies you could add onto this [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3698.3199999999997s)]
*  in adjacencies. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3700.3199999999997s)]
*  My understanding is Mantle and Pulley raised [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3701.7999999999997s)]
*  in the low single-digit millions, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3703.0s)]
*  that gives them a lot of room to run a 25 [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3705.8399999999997s)]
*  and $50 million business profitably [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3708.56s)]
*  and never raise any more money. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3710.56s)]
*  The problem is on the opposite side. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3712.72s)]
*  If you raise money at eight or nine or $10 billion [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3714.12s)]
*  when companies traded 20 times, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3717.08s)]
*  and now companies trade it six times, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3719.3999999999996s)]
*  now all of a sudden you have to have $1.3 billion [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3721.8799999999997s)]
*  of revenue a year to break even. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3724.72s)]
*  And I think that's the real problem. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3727.56s)]
*  So it's not that Henry hasn't built a great company. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3728.8999999999996s)]
*  I think he deserves a lot of credit. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3732.2s)]
*  The question is entry point and the question is upside. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3733.16s)]
*  And the upside is governed by the difficulty [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3735.8799999999997s)]
*  of the things that you're doing [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3738.8199999999997s)]
*  and how much pricing power you have [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3740.04s)]
*  for those difficult things. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3742.8399999999997s)]
*  And so I think what we're realizing is that [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3743.8799999999997s)]
*  there are a few difficult things in software. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3746.9199999999996s)]
*  Few, I mean, it's just true. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3749.6s)]
*  And as a result, every product, this is not a Carta thing, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3751.52s)]
*  every product will see a ton of competitors. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3755.08s)]
*  So the only thing that you can do [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3757.8799999999997s)]
*  is have an extremely leveraged OPEX [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3760.6s)]
*  and an extremely low cost to serve. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3764.12s)]
*  That is the only protective mechanism one has, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3767.12s)]
*  it seems to me on the outside looking in. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3770.7599999999998s)]
*  Network effects are also important. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3772.7999999999997s)]
*  Unless you have an Instagram, you're right, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3774.64s)]
*  that product is infinitely better with everybody. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3777.52s)]
*  Or a TikTok, great. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3780.04s)]
*  Now you can spend as much money as you want. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3781.32s)]
*  Uber, Airbnb, network effect businesses. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3783.16s)]
*  But that's not what I think procedural software is. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3784.96s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3790.64s)]
*  I mean, look, we're gonna just have to agree to disagree. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3791.48s)]
*  I think there is some pricing risk to Carta [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3793.52s)]
*  from these competitors, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3797.0s)]
*  but my guess is it ends up being stickier than that. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3797.84s)]
*  But in any event, I mean, I do think that Henry [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3801.62s)]
*  at the end of the day pulled off a nice save [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3804.08s)]
*  by just getting rid of the business altogether. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3805.68s)]
*  I think that was a smart way to respond. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3808.0s)]
*  Clearly the first response didn't work. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3810.48s)]
*  No, the first response was sort of like a very, [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3812.68s)]
*  it was a very confusing denial [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3815.92s)]
*  where he said this isn't our policy, but. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3817.88s)]
*  And he also blamed, he also got into it [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3821.2400000000002s)]
*  and blamed the person who called him out on it. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3822.92s)]
*  It was like, why are you calling us out on this? [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3825.04s)]
*  And then like every founder was like, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3827.08s)]
*  because you violated our trust. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3828.6800000000003s)]
*  And he was like, oh yeah, sorry. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3830.0s)]
*  Yeah, well also people are showing like email campaigns [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3831.56s)]
*  that have been going on for months [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3836.32s)]
*  and it seemed much more organized. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3837.44s)]
*  And it was very hard to believe [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3839.0s)]
*  that this was just an accident [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3840.44s)]
*  instead of a deliberate strategy. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3841.6s)]
*  And you could see the whole startup community [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3843.36s)]
*  was evaluating its options in real time on X. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3845.36s)]
*  And that's when he came out [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3850.52s)]
*  and hit the whole thing with a sledgehammer [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3851.36s)]
*  and just said, we're gonna get out of this business. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3852.64s)]
*  Smart move. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3854.12s)]
*  And I think it was really smart to do that. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3854.96s)]
*  It's kind of called the crisis. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3856.48s)]
*  Like I said, I don't think this is a business [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3858.72s)]
*  that startup founders want their cap table software [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3860.72s)]
*  to be engaged in. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3865.2s)]
*  No, definitely not. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3866.4s)]
*  And just by the way, just a third point on that, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3867.24s)]
*  one reason was price discovery. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3869.36s)]
*  Another reason was having undesirable shareholders. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3870.44s)]
*  The third reason is just, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3873.24s)]
*  founders don't wanna create a competing fundraising process [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3875.16s)]
*  to primary financing. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3878.4s)]
*  I think this is actually a really important point. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3880.4s)]
*  The reason why founders don't want there [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3881.92s)]
*  to be a secondary market is because their company [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3884.08s)]
*  may need to raise money. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3886.76s)]
*  Yeah, you wanna go through the front door to the CEO [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3888.28s)]
*  and the board, not the side door [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3890.76s)]
*  to get some exposure to the company. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3892.52s)]
*  Well, I think in the ZERP era [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3895.92s)]
*  where there was all this excess funding flying around, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3897.7200000000003s)]
*  then it kind of made sense to let secondaries happen. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3901.44s)]
*  But in a world in which funding is scarce, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3903.56s)]
*  you want that money to go into the company, [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3906.12s)]
*  not into the pockets of the early shareholders. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3909.1600000000003s)]
*  And so I think the timing of this whole thing [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3910.6400000000003s)]
*  is really off. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3912.5600000000004s)]
*  It all feels like a function of ZERP in its own way. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3913.88s)]
*  Yeah, agree. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3916.96s)]
*  All right, so actually we're in the group chat [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3917.96s)]
*  talking about this viral clip about Star Wars. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3919.52s)]
*  You wanted to chime in on it. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3922.6400000000003s)]
*  Maybe you could queue it up, Nick. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3923.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, as you may recall, [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3925.48s)]
*  my pick for business loser of 2023 was Disney. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3926.6800000000003s)]
*  And it seems like they haven't learned anything [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3930.2000000000003s)]
*  from the horrible year they've just had. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3932.32s)]
*  What is the balance of activating a force for change, [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3934.36s)]
*  but also trying to permeate that patriarchy, [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3940.0s)]
*  that power structure? [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3946.8s)]
*  And is that a part of the calculation of your art as well? [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3948.28s)]
*  And what's been the reaction to that? [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3952.0s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3954.4s)]
*  I like to make men uncomfortable. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3956.8s)]
*  I enjoy making men uncomfortable. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3960.0800000000004s)]
*  This is the new director of Star Wars. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3964.7200000000003s)]
*  All right, your thoughts, Nick? [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3966.32s)]
*  Well, I saw the comment on that tweet was, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3967.84s)]
*  this is gonna be the biggest Disney flop yet. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3970.6400000000003s)]
*  Isn't that what it said? [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3973.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, look, I don't know what Bob Iger is doing. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3974.0800000000004s)]
*  He seems to wanna burn Star Wars to the ground [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3977.04s)]
*  like the rest of the Disney brands by playing politics. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3979.6800000000003s)]
*  This director doesn't seem to have had a lifelong fandom [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3984.1600000000003s)]
*  for the franchise. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3988.92s)]
*  She didn't really talk about [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3989.92s)]
*  how she had grown up marinating in this universe, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3991.56s)]
*  loving its characters. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3994.36s)]
*  Her background is in documentary filmmaking [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3996.48s)]
*  and there's nothing wrong with that, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3998.32s)]
*  but there's no indication from her [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=3999.52s)]
*  that she truly loves Star Wars. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4002.36s)]
*  And in fact, the comments that she's making right now [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4003.68s)]
*  are indicating that she's gonna politicize it. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4006.88s)]
*  The patriarchy is not why anybody is a fan of Star Wars [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4008.84s)]
*  that goes to see its movies. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4012.24s)]
*  So nobody wants to see that movie. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4013.72s)]
*  It's the opposite. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4016.08s)]
*  It's the opposite, they wanna avoid it. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4017.16s)]
*  They don't go to Star Wars movies for the politics. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4018.36s)]
*  And she's also trying to solve a problem [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4021.2s)]
*  that doesn't really exist. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4024.9199999999996s)]
*  I mean, science fiction may skew male in its fan base, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4026.56s)]
*  but it's not because sci-fi franchises [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4030.9199999999996s)]
*  don't like strong female characters. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4033.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, just stepping out to the larger world for a second, [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4036.3999999999996s)]
*  you've got Ripley in Aliens, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4038.68s)]
*  you've got Sarah Connor in the Terminator movies, [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4040.56s)]
*  you've got- Princess Leia. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4042.64s)]
*  Trinity and the Matrix, you got Princess Leia, [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4044.3999999999996s)]
*  Padme, Ahsoka in Star Wars. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4046.4399999999996s)]
*  You seem to know a lot of these female characters. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4050.72s)]
*  You're deep in the Star Wars world. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4052.68s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a Star Wars geek. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4053.52s)]
*  I'm a Star Wars geek. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4055.3199999999997s)]
*  You got some good pulls here, yeah, Padme. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4056.16s)]
*  This idea that there aren't strong female characters [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4057.9199999999996s)]
*  in Star Wars, that's just kind of a myth, right? [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4060.8399999999997s)]
*  So it's not like the universe needs to be reset in this way. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4064.44s)]
*  And you could just see the whole fan community [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4067.96s)]
*  kind of groaned at this comment [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4071.48s)]
*  because they're just like, oh, here we go again. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4073.12s)]
*  Star Wars is gonna ruin another franchise [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4075.48s)]
*  by playing politics. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4078.3999999999996s)]
*  And the amazing thing is that [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4081.52s)]
*  Iger just doesn't seem to learn from this at all. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4082.6s)]
*  But there's nothing wrong [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4085.3199999999997s)]
*  with having a female director either, right, Sacks? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4086.88s)]
*  I mean, you're not saying that. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4089.16s)]
*  You're saying that a particular person [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4090.08s)]
*  who has a political agenda [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4091.6s)]
*  in how they wanna shape the story of Star Wars [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4093.4s)]
*  is the issue. Of course. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4096.24s)]
*  Right. Of course. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4097.12s)]
*  Now, I'll also say, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4097.96s)]
*  I think one of the core driving narratives, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4098.84s)]
*  emotional narratives of Star Wars [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4100.96s)]
*  is the oppressor oppressed storyline. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4103.16s)]
*  It's a highly political storyline. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4106.12s)]
*  It's a highly political storyline. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4107.68s)]
*  I always said, I think Star Wars has been [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4109.12s)]
*  the most anti-technology effector in society since the 70s [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4111.32s)]
*  because Star Wars is all about, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4117.16s)]
*  I've said this before, [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4119.0s)]
*  but the Ewoks destroying the Death Star [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4119.88s)]
*  and the no tech overcoming the oppressor big tech. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4122.64s)]
*  And so we have to destroy big tech. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4126.36s)]
*  And anyone who has the better technology [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4128.08s)]
*  is very likely the oppressor. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4130.76s)]
*  And they have all the wealth [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4132.96s)]
*  and they have all the power [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4134.64s)]
*  and they have all the control. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4135.48s)]
*  And so those who do not have the power [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4136.84s)]
*  do not have the wealth, do not have the control, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4138.64s)]
*  do not have the technology have to go and destroy that, [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4140.240000000001s)]
*  whether it's the empire or that kind of evil force. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4143.64s)]
*  And that's the core narrative of Star Wars. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4146.64s)]
*  So I do think that at its heart, [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4148.84s)]
*  Star Wars in and of itself is an oppressor oppressed [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4150.320000000001s)]
*  storyline that relates very deeply to technology and wealth [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4153.6s)]
*  and has helped shape the Western psyche [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4158.0s)]
*  for a couple of decades in a very meaningful way, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4160.08s)]
*  or has really reflected maybe perhaps the Western psyche. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4162.56s)]
*  What did you think of Andor? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4165.68s)]
*  I think you're superimposing current day terminology [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4167.36s)]
*  on a movie that was created in the first one in the 1970s [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4172.08s)]
*  when intersectionality did not exist. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4176.679999999999s)]
*  Yes, there are political overtones to Star Wars. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4179.719999999999s)]
*  You've got the rebel Alliance against the empire. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4182.0s)]
*  That is not diversity politics. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4184.759999999999s)]
*  Sorry, it's about- [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4187.2s)]
*  I'm not saying diversity politics. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4188.5199999999995s)]
*  It's really about the corruption of power. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4190.28s)]
*  I mean, you know, the famous phrase by Lord Acton, [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4193.12s)]
*  which is power corrupts and absolute power corrupts [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4196.44s)]
*  absolutely, to me, those are the political overtones [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4198.4s)]
*  of Star Wars. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4201.5199999999995s)]
*  It's not about dividing the world [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4202.36s)]
*  into intersectional categories. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4204.599999999999s)]
*  It was about war. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4206.36s)]
*  I mean, let's be honest. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4207.44s)]
*  Lucas was a child of the Vietnam War era [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4208.639999999999s)]
*  and he was highly influenced as was Francis Ford Coppola. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4210.879999999999s)]
*  And- [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4214.0s)]
*  Yeah, the Americans with all this wealth and power [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4214.839999999999s)]
*  came into the jungle to try and destroy a peasant nation [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4217.04s)]
*  and cause death on a part of peasant nation. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4219.919999999999s)]
*  And the peasant nation survived and won. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4222.599999999999s)]
*  And there was a narrative to that [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4224.88s)]
*  that I think is reflected in this [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4226.56s)]
*  and is reflected very deeply in a lot of the stories [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4227.88s)]
*  that have come since. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4229.84s)]
*  And I'm not saying DEI is, as a solution, [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4230.68s)]
*  was the storyline out of the original Star Wars, [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4233.64s)]
*  but the original Star Wars was very much driven [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4236.0s)]
*  by the leverage that technology provides to those in power [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4237.8s)]
*  that gives them, you know, extraordinary influence [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4242.16s)]
*  over those who don't have power. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4244.56s)]
*  Well, if there were political overtones [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4245.6s)]
*  to the original two trilogies, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4247.32s)]
*  and actually I think there were some really interesting [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4249.4800000000005s)]
*  themes, especially in that second one where Palpatine- [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4251.36s)]
*  Seizes power. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4254.36s)]
*  By the way, not even political. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4255.5599999999995s)]
*  Let me just be clear, social, right? [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4257.12s)]
*  So social systems, which- [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4258.84s)]
*  I understand, but my point is that Lucas didn't hit anybody [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4260.5199999999995s)]
*  over the head with those themes. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4265.679999999999s)]
*  And his goal certainly wasn't to make anyone feel [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4268.28s)]
*  uncomfortable, his goal was to entertain. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4270.639999999999s)]
*  And whatever political or social overtones there were, [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4274.2s)]
*  were very much in the background [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4277.24s)]
*  because that's what good art does. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4278.84s)]
*  One of the reasons why Hollywood produces [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4280.64s)]
*  so few really interesting movies these days [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4283.76s)]
*  is because the political overtones are really [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4286.4800000000005s)]
*  in the forefront and they really hit you [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4289.12s)]
*  over the head with them. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4290.92s)]
*  And so therefore they're just not very entertaining. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4292.68s)]
*  It's just not very good art. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4295.0s)]
*  And I think that's why the fan community was like, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4296.84s)]
*  oh, here we go again. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4299.0s)]
*  Let me just make sure people understand, [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4300.400000000001s)]
*  this is a nine-year-old clip, and for context, [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4302.280000000001s)]
*  this is probably during like the early days [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4304.4400000000005s)]
*  of the DEI movement, just so we're clear on that. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4307.56s)]
*  But you had another point to make David. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4309.8s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4311.320000000001s)]
*  But Sachs, I think that Hollywood has imposed upon itself [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4312.16s)]
*  a certain degrees of restriction on the artistry [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4316.2s)]
*  of the artists in the community, because the standards now [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4319.2s)]
*  to be nominated for best picture define a number [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4322.400000000001s)]
*  of DEI representation and inclusion standards, [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4325.8s)]
*  and they're listed here. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4328.76s)]
*  So in order to, and if you guys will remember it [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4330.16s)]
*  at our summit in LA, I asked Gwyneth Paltrow about this, [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4332.4800000000005s)]
*  and she wasn't familiar with these changes [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4336.04s)]
*  that had been put in place. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4338.32s)]
*  But in order to qualify for a best picture nomination, [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4339.759999999999s)]
*  you have to meet some of these standards. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4343.719999999999s)]
*  And these standards include on-screen representation, [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4346.04s)]
*  themes and narratives that relate to having [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4349.16s)]
*  at least one of the lead characters [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4351.8s)]
*  or significant supporting actors come [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4353.599999999999s)]
*  from minority background, including ethnic background, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4355.44s)]
*  or by gender. Oh my God. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4360.12s)]
*  I could get nominated for an Oscar. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4362.599999999999s)]
*  Look, I'm so lucky. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4364.4s)]
*  South Asian. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4366.24s)]
*  Look, I'm in the per ends here. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4367.5199999999995s)]
*  Or at least 30% of the actors in a secondary cat [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4369.96s)]
*  in the secondary group have to be women, [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4374.96s)]
*  racial or ethnic group, LGBTQ plus, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4376.719999999999s)]
*  or people with cognitive or physical disabilities, [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4379.639999999999s)]
*  or who are deaf or hard of hearing. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4382.24s)]
*  The main storyline, theme or narrative of the film [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4384.16s)]
*  is centered on an unrepresented group, [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4386.76s)]
*  either women, racial or ethnic group, or LGBTQ positive. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4389.08s)]
*  They can meet the criteria. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4392.32s)]
*  If the creative leadership team has at least two [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4393.96s)]
*  of the following creative leadership positions [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4396.96s)]
*  met by one of the underrepresented groups, [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4397.84s)]
*  and so on and so forth. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4400.16s)]
*  If you're an artist, a filmmaker, [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4401.28s)]
*  and you wanted to make a film, a World War II biopic, [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4403.88s)]
*  which was on the front lines in World War II [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4406.76s)]
*  and was entirely white males, [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4409.12s)]
*  would you have been able to be nominated for best picture, [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4411.24s)]
*  or would you have had to go and take some actions [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4414.599999999999s)]
*  that would have affected your artistry [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4417.5599999999995s)]
*  and your freedom of expression in making that film? [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4419.92s)]
*  And as a big fan of film, and you guys, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4422.76s)]
*  I think all of us are probably in the same boat, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4424.64s)]
*  at least a couple of us are. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4426.400000000001s)]
*  Three of us are. Three of us are. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4427.240000000001s)]
*  This would have limited a lot of the best pictures [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4429.08s)]
*  of all time, I would say, [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4431.280000000001s)]
*  if you had to impose standards on what the artists [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4433.4800000000005s)]
*  were allowed to do, or how they were allowed [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4436.6s)]
*  to make their film. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4438.4400000000005s)]
*  And that's really what's taken over Hollywood. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4439.4400000000005s)]
*  So I would say it's not just a Bob Iger Disney thing, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4441.08s)]
*  but this has become a standard in Hollywood [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4443.88s)]
*  that the DEI movement has so deeply affected [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4446.08s)]
*  the intentionality of what has historically [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4449.72s)]
*  been a truly creative [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4451.84s)]
*  artistic freedom. I agree. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4453.92s)]
*  If you talk to Hollywood writers, [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4454.76s)]
*  if you talk to Hollywood writers, [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4455.96s)]
*  they'll tell you that things have become [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4456.96s)]
*  extremely politicized and it's a mess. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4458.4s)]
*  Iger's been a little bit contradictory about this. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4460.8s)]
*  In April of last year, there was this article saying [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4462.8s)]
*  that Iger was doubling down on inclusivity and diversity, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4465.92s)]
*  and he described that at a shareholders meeting. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4469.4800000000005s)]
*  By November, he was saying that Disney movies [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4471.4s)]
*  have become too focused on messaging. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4474.76s)]
*  So it seemed like he was finally getting it, [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4476.4s)]
*  that after the horrible year they had, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4479.52s)]
*  but then we had this Star Wars news, [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4481.92s)]
*  and it seemed to suggest that they were hiring a director [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4484.16s)]
*  who really wasn't right for the material. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4487.56s)]
*  So we'll just have to see. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4489.68s)]
*  My sense is that they have not made [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4491.36s)]
*  the course correction they need. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4493.88s)]
*  If you want to see the peak of this, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4495.64s)]
*  there was a bunch of blowback on Dunkirk, [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4497.12s)]
*  an absolutely tour de force of a film, [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4500.68s)]
*  if you haven't seen it, especially go see it in IMAX, [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4503.0s)]
*  just extraordinary Christopher Nolan film, [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4506.28s)]
*  that it lacked diversity and gender diversity. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4508.2s)]
*  It's a war film, historically, kind of hard [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4512.4800000000005s)]
*  to make it about anything else [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4515.72s)]
*  if it was just narrowly focused on a couple of battles. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4517.04s)]
*  And so, yeah, this has gotten to the point of, [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4520.320000000001s)]
*  yeah, a little bit of absurdity. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4523.08s)]
*  I relate this very much to the point [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4524.8s)]
*  that we made a couple months ago [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4526.68s)]
*  about standup comics being restricted and canceled [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4528.04s)]
*  based on the things that they say that are offensive [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4530.56s)]
*  to the narratives of social inclusion and DEI. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4533.200000000001s)]
*  These are artists who should have freedom of expression, [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4537.84s)]
*  creative freedom, unlimited creative freedom. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4540.6s)]
*  If we want to have a different set of standards [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4542.92s)]
*  for how we value the art that comes out of it, fine, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4544.56s)]
*  but I don't think that it ends up being true. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4547.6s)]
*  So what the peer group would otherwise recognize and say, [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4550.200000000001s)]
*  you know, is the greatest art of the year [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4554.04s)]
*  is the most impressive achievement of the year [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4556.240000000001s)]
*  in some particular artistic discipline. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4559.320000000001s)]
*  It's really sad. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4561.4400000000005s)]
*  There's also been this change in live performances, [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4563.160000000001s)]
*  in symphonies. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4566.84s)]
*  Used to be that to avoid discrimination in auditions [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4568.4800000000005s)]
*  for symphony orchestras, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4571.360000000001s)]
*  auditions were conducted behind a curtain. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4573.24s)]
*  So the director and those who were making the election [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4575.52s)]
*  on who would get to join the orchestra would listen [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4578.68s)]
*  and they wouldn't see the person performing [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4581.96s)]
*  because they were behind a curtain. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4584.16s)]
*  Recently that trend has changed [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4586.04s)]
*  and now those artists are required to perform [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4588.0s)]
*  not behind a curtain, but in front of the curtain [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4590.68s)]
*  so that we can judge them not on their musicianship [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4592.88s)]
*  and their artistry, but on their race, on their gender [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4595.96s)]
*  and on some other standards. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4599.4800000000005s)]
*  So I think this is obviously part of a very broad narrative, [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4600.92s)]
*  but it's very deeply affecting- [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4603.360000000001s)]
*  Can I ask a question? [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4604.96s)]
*  The community of arts. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4606.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was about to bring you in on this, Jamal. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4606.84s)]
*  Is listenership of the symphony gone up or down? [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4609.24s)]
*  It's been going down for a long time, [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4613.08s)]
*  but I don't know if that has to do with diversity. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4615.08s)]
*  Symphony around the world are seeing decline in audience, [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4615.92s)]
*  but it happened before the changes. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4617.88s)]
*  It's been happening, yeah. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4621.16s)]
*  Has it accelerated or has it slowed [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4622.4400000000005s)]
*  the negative decay to zero? [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4624.8s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4626.28s)]
*  I'm not sure it's made a difference. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4627.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, to be honest. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4628.68s)]
*  Well, if it hasn't made a difference, [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4629.96s)]
*  then it has made a difference. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4631.68s)]
*  I mean, I think this is part of a wider discussion of DEI. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4634.0s)]
*  The goal of some forms of art, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4637.72s)]
*  like these live performing arts, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4640.04s)]
*  may not necessarily be audience growth. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4641.4400000000005s)]
*  The goal may be finding the best artists. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4643.360000000001s)]
*  Perfection, yeah, perfection. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4645.64s)]
*  But I suspect it should be to sustain itself indefinitely. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4647.52s)]
*  I mean, that was, by the way, that's a big point. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4651.12s)]
*  I've had it, which I disagree with. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4652.96s)]
*  As the quality erodes, fewer people will care, [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4655.52s)]
*  because there are other options that you can go to [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4657.64s)]
*  that are high quality, and then these things will die out. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4659.68s)]
*  And maybe that's what it's supposed to happen. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4662.72s)]
*  I mean, this is part of a wider discussion about, I think, [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4665.56s)]
*  DEI facing the reality of whether it's like, [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4668.0s)]
*  I guess, this whole pilot thing with Boeing [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4672.68s)]
*  and who's getting hired to be pilots and training. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4674.8s)]
*  What should the focus of a company board be? [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4677.84s)]
*  What should the focus of hiring be? [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4680.04s)]
*  The problem, I think, with the argument [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4683.08s)]
*  you guys are having, in my opinion, [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4684.6s)]
*  is that it's a little too premature. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4686.12s)]
*  And the reason is that there are other people [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4689.08s)]
*  who will make semi-credible claims [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4691.24s)]
*  while you guys make semi-credible claims, [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4695.04s)]
*  and no progress is made on this whole DEI discussion [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4697.28s)]
*  as it touches cinema and Hollywood or music. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4700.32s)]
*  What's much easier, if you want to dismantle DEI, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4703.84s)]
*  which will eventually come and cleanse Hollywood [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4707.48s)]
*  and the symphony, is if you go to the jobs [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4711.04s)]
*  where it's irrefutable, where even the most ardent defender [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4713.639999999999s)]
*  of DEI says, you know what, I can't take that risk [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4717.879999999999s)]
*  with my own family or with my own life [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4720.48s)]
*  and the lives of my family. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4722.719999999999s)]
*  And I think that we would be better off [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4724.5199999999995s)]
*  if we just focus in a really disciplined way on those [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4727.04s)]
*  and get the criteria to be entirely based on skill. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4730.44s)]
*  And then eventually it'll come back [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4733.959999999999s)]
*  and Hollywood and the symphony will also get cleansed. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4735.6s)]
*  So doctors, pilots. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4739.64s)]
*  I mean, I would say certain doctors. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4741.8s)]
*  I would just say pilots for sure. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4744.160000000001s)]
*  I would say surgeons. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4746.280000000001s)]
*  I would say that you could probably go through, [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4747.6s)]
*  I haven't thought enough about it to know, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4751.120000000001s)]
*  but you could go through and say systematically, [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4753.4400000000005s)]
*  what are the categories in the professional world [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4756.280000000001s)]
*  that we interact with every day where skill, [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4761.280000000001s)]
*  can be the only criteria, must be, [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4766.080000000001s)]
*  because otherwise innocent lives will be lost. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4769.320000000001s)]
*  That's an important question. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4772.76s)]
*  I agree with you that the fundamental choice [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4774.68s)]
*  that we have as a society is whether skills [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4776.360000000001s)]
*  is gonna be the determinant of success, skills and merit, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4779.400000000001s)]
*  or whether it's gonna be about something else. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4782.200000000001s)]
*  And as soon as you tell somebody that they can't get [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4785.280000000001s)]
*  the job, even though they're the most qualified [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4787.200000000001s)]
*  because of their race or gender, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4790.400000000001s)]
*  then I think that is racism or sexism. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4791.76s)]
*  So it's doubly bad. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4795.36s)]
*  But Jamoth, I think the reason why this happens [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4796.599999999999s)]
*  is because people don't really have [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4799.88s)]
*  the right skin in the game. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4802.32s)]
*  So the reason why the recent discussions about pilots [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4803.92s)]
*  and whether cockpits should have this sort of DEI program [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4808.679999999999s)]
*  is that everyone can relate. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4813.16s)]
*  Everyone has skin in the game. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4814.48s)]
*  If your kids are gonna fly on a plane, [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4815.639999999999s)]
*  the only determinant you want for who the pilot is [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4819.32s)]
*  is skill, obviously, [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4822.5599999999995s)]
*  because you have real skin in the game. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4824.28s)]
*  The problem is people will falsify their preferences [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4825.84s)]
*  when they're discussing other people flying on the plane. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4829.719999999999s)]
*  So people will start saying, [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4832.44s)]
*  well, we need to have DEI programs. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4833.599999999999s)]
*  In other words, when it doesn't affect me, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4836.679999999999s)]
*  you're willing to basically virtue signal [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4838.5199999999995s)]
*  and genuflect towards these programs. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4842.16s)]
*  And I think that's the fundamental problem [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4844.48s)]
*  is that people will pretend to support [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4846.8s)]
*  something other than skill in all of these contexts [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4850.28s)]
*  where they're not directly affected. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4852.96s)]
*  But as a society, we are. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4855.4s)]
*  With respect to aviation specifically, [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4857.16s)]
*  my thought is that this is a very easy skill [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4859.28s)]
*  to determine who is high quality versus not [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4864.86s)]
*  because you have such sophisticated training apparatus [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4867.56s)]
*  and schemes. Simulators. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4872.32s)]
*  Simulators and all of this stuff. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4873.84s)]
*  It's easy to know how to rank people from one through N. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4875.44s)]
*  And I think that as a society, [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4879.08s)]
*  if you want an efficient transportation infrastructure [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4881.28s)]
*  and aviation infrastructure where the consequences [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4883.5599999999995s)]
*  are really bad, if things go wrong, [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4885.48s)]
*  you just want the best period end of story. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4887.2s)]
*  However, I think it's also fair to say [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4889.44s)]
*  that then the government owes the people [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4891.259999999999s)]
*  a responsibility to advance the technology [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4894.48s)]
*  if they actually want to have a multifaceted [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4897.66s)]
*  hiring criteria. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4901.219999999999s)]
*  So what do I mean? [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4902.0599999999995s)]
*  We can have a lot more automation in the cockpit. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4904.08s)]
*  The reason we don't is because of how certain lobbies [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4908.52s)]
*  are able to affect rules inside the federal [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4913.92s)]
*  transportation infrastructure. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4919.0s)]
*  And we know this because our friend has been trying to, [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4920.56s)]
*  our friend, Sky Dayton, wonderful pilot, [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4922.900000000001s)]
*  has been trying to improve airline safety. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4926.120000000001s)]
*  And he's talked about this a lot. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4929.240000000001s)]
*  And these things get blocked by the pilots union [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4930.4400000000005s)]
*  and otherwise, because they don't want [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4932.580000000001s)]
*  to get disintermediate. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4934.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay, fair enough. That's the game. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4935.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, if that's the game, at some point, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4937.32s)]
*  we need to have a conversation as a society that says, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4938.719999999999s)]
*  okay, look, if we're gonna hire on a multifaceted basis [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4941.36s)]
*  for pilots, let's also tell Boeing and Airbus, [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4945.799999999999s)]
*  you need to build even better, more automated planes. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4948.599999999999s)]
*  That's a fair trade off. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4952.16s)]
*  The great irony of all this, Sax, is it's illegal [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4953.299999999999s)]
*  to hire based upon gender, race, et cetera. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4955.88s)]
*  And then at the same time, people are trying to hold [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4959.46s)]
*  this construct of, hey, we want more diversity, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4961.799999999999s)]
*  we want more inclusion, at the same time in their heads [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4963.759999999999s)]
*  and we're seeing lawsuits happen. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4967.9s)]
*  So they want tech companies to report on their diversity. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4969.299999999999s)]
*  They want venture firms to report on [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4973.58s)]
*  either diversity and investment, but it's illegal [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4977.0199999999995s)]
*  and you can be sued if you were to give investment dollars [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4980.179999999999s)]
*  based on race, gender, et cetera, and Fierce Founders, [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4984.86s)]
*  I believe is the name of the firm that's being sued [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4988.639999999999s)]
*  for only investing in a certain demographic of women. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4990.98s)]
*  Yeah, or to ask people their sexual preference. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4994.139999999999s)]
*  You're not allowed to ask that in an employment application. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4996.06s)]
*  I've always had a problem with how do you keep [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=4998.580000000001s)]
*  these two things in your mind in our own venture firm? [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5000.46s)]
*  And I just said to folks just to get personal. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5002.900000000001s)]
*  This is considered a diversity target [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5004.740000000001s)]
*  and now to hire people, whether it's on a Hollywood film set [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5006.5s)]
*  or in your company, you've got to go ask them [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5009.9400000000005s)]
*  what their sexual preference is? [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5011.46s)]
*  It's crazy that we're being asked to do that [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5014.580000000001s)]
*  and what I did in our company was I said, hey, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5017.06s)]
*  if we don't feel we're getting enough applicants [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5018.9800000000005s)]
*  for the programs, Founding University, the Accelerator, [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5021.1s)]
*  we could have efforts to increase the number of applicants, [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5023.92s)]
*  but we can't make investment decisions based on anything [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5029.6s)]
*  other than the merit of the company or we will get sued. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5032.16s)]
*  And so this is, I think, the problem in corporate America [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5035.4400000000005s)]
*  with these issues is how do I try to help this problem [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5037.72s)]
*  if we think there is a diversity problem [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5041.08s)]
*  in our particular industry, which is noble and thoughtful [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5042.4400000000005s)]
*  and I wouldn't criticize anybody for that, [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5045.4s)]
*  but then the rubber meets the road at legal [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5047.04s)]
*  and then performance, right? [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5049.12s)]
*  And it's very hard for, I think, leaders [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5050.32s)]
*  to manage those two dichotomies. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5053.24s)]
*  I could see a case for why barbers and priests [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5055.8s)]
*  should be multifaceted, good bedside manner, [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5060.04s)]
*  crack a few jokes, be able to listen. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5063.08s)]
*  Relatability. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5065.12s)]
*  Relatability. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5065.96s)]
*  But if a pilot, but the first time, [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5068.4s)]
*  like the thing is now this thing is so on the front burner [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5070.96s)]
*  of people's minds that heaven forbid, [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5074.36s)]
*  if there is an incident or a near incident, [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5079.599999999999s)]
*  you're gonna see lawsuits that are gonna focus [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5082.5199999999995s)]
*  on this issue. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5084.639999999999s)]
*  Show me the training records of the pilots [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5085.759999999999s)]
*  and show me how they fared relative to alternative folks [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5088.12s)]
*  that you either did hire or didn't hire [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5092.879999999999s)]
*  and why was this selection, it's gonna be a mess. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5095.759999999999s)]
*  We might even see that with Harvard [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5099.32s)]
*  and their selection of their president. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5100.599999999999s)]
*  Like why was this person selected as president, right? [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5102.4s)]
*  And did we check there? [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5104.919999999999s)]
*  The new one. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5106.32s)]
*  Or the past one, did we know about the plagiarism stuff? [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5107.16s)]
*  Did we not know about it? [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5110.679999999999s)]
*  And this is, I think, the race to nowhere [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5112.719999999999s)]
*  when you get into identity politics. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5114.799999999999s)]
*  And I think this is why everybody, [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5116.5199999999995s)]
*  and I think Coleman Hughes said it really brilliantly [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5118.839999999999s)]
*  when he was on this pod, talking about his TED Talk, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5120.919999999999s)]
*  like we at least want the aspiration [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5123.4s)]
*  of having a colorblind society. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5125.879999999999s)]
*  I think what Coleman said that was really, [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5128.16s)]
*  I think profound was, [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5130.08s)]
*  where can we actually affect change that will be important? [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5131.719999999999s)]
*  And I think that's early education. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5135.32s)]
*  It could be providing pre-K, it could be providing, [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5137.32s)]
*  support for people with childcare so that, [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5141.04s)]
*  they could get into more job training, et cetera. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5144.36s)]
*  So where do we put our efforts [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5147.84s)]
*  if we do wanna see a more inclusive, [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5150.12s)]
*  diverse, just world, is I think the question. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5152.48s)]
*  Backing up a second, [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5155.48s)]
*  I think there's a fundamental dishonesty [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5156.32s)]
*  about the DEI movement [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5158.48s)]
*  that's really coming to the fore right now. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5159.76s)]
*  On the one hand, DEI activists will explicitly say [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5162.32s)]
*  that their goal is to engineer job categories [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5165.32s)]
*  to explicit population numbers. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5170.12s)]
*  But like you said, that's actually illegal to do. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5174.4s)]
*  So when they get in a lawsuit, [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5176.72s)]
*  like the Harvard affirmative action case [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5177.92s)]
*  that went to the Supreme Court, [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5179.96s)]
*  they'll deny that they're discriminating [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5181.32s)]
*  against Asian Americans. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5182.88s)]
*  So when they're preaching for what they wanna do, [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5183.88s)]
*  when they talk about say, Kendi style anti-racism, [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5186.96s)]
*  they will say that the explicit goal here [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5189.76s)]
*  is proportional representation. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5192.2s)]
*  But then when that results in discrimination [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5193.84s)]
*  against groups that are basically selected against, [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5196.12s)]
*  they'll deny that that's what they're doing. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5199.32s)]
*  And I think it's gotten to the point now [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5201.16s)]
*  where they just can't maintain both things being true. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5202.759999999999s)]
*  And I think we saw this in the dust up [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5205.639999999999s)]
*  that just happened between Elon and Mark Cuban, [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5208.32s)]
*  where Elon was saying, look, we should be a colorblind, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5211.5199999999995s)]
*  meritorious society. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5215.5199999999995s)]
*  We just shouldn't discriminate for or against anybody [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5217.16s)]
*  on the basis of race. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5220.48s)]
*  And then Cuban jumps in and says, [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5222.04s)]
*  oh no, that's not what DEI is doing. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5223.12s)]
*  DEI is just trying to expand the pool of applicants. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5224.48s)]
*  It's just not true. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5228.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if he's being disingenuous. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5229.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't know if he's virtue signaling. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5231.320000000001s)]
*  I think they were talking through each other. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5233.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, you do wanna expand the pool [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5234.64s)]
*  if you're not getting a pool of diverse applicants. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5236.84s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that, expanding the pool. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5239.4800000000005s)]
*  But what you are correct, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5241.6s)]
*  there was a DEI grift that occurred. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5242.88s)]
*  I think that's kind of what you're alluding to. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5244.84s)]
*  And I can tell you the inside story on the grift. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5246.4800000000005s)]
*  I think that if you look at the DEI movement, [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5248.320000000001s)]
*  it goes way, way beyond just expanding the pool of applicants. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5249.6s)]
*  It explicitly puts its thumb on the scale [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5253.400000000001s)]
*  in terms of what it's looking for [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5256.6s)]
*  in terms of hiring and promotion. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5258.68s)]
*  It turned into a grift. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5262.4400000000005s)]
*  And I can tell you the inside story on this. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5263.4400000000005s)]
*  And it's gonna come out eventually, but there was a, [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5265.0s)]
*  I don't know if you experienced this in any of your companies [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5268.4400000000005s)]
*  or if anybody's willing to talk about it, [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5271.280000000001s)]
*  but company has lack of diversity in their company. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5272.8s)]
*  Then diversity activists, and this is, I think, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5278.08s)]
*  where it really started to build up resentment. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5281.56s)]
*  Diversity activists comes in, says, [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5284.360000000001s)]
*  hey, you have problems. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5286.12s)]
*  They call them out on social media. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5287.4s)]
*  There was a Twitter brigade comes in. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5289.08s)]
*  Oh my God, look how horrible this company is. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5292.96s)]
*  People go, oh, I'm sorry, we didn't wanna be horrible. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5294.68s)]
*  And then they say, oh, well, hire us. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5296.68s)]
*  And we'll teach you how to do DEI [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5299.08s)]
*  and let's build a DEI group. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5300.5599999999995s)]
*  And we wanna be consultants. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5301.88s)]
*  Pay us to come in, pay us to speak at your organization [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5302.88s)]
*  to tell you what you're doing wrong. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5305.84s)]
*  And then rally a reverse support of it [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5307.5599999999995s)]
*  after you've gotten paid for solving the problem for them. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5310.2s)]
*  And I saw this shakedown occur [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5314.16s)]
*  and I had people ask me for advice on like, [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5316.639999999999s)]
*  hey, what do we do here? [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5318.5199999999995s)]
*  And you can just imagine, you're a person of good faith [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5320.0s)]
*  who wants to do the right thing. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5323.08s)]
*  And then these DEI folks come in [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5324.48s)]
*  and then try to brigade you, basically publicly shame you [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5326.2s)]
*  in order to get rich DEI contracts. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5330.88s)]
*  And we saw this with the size of DEI groups at companies [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5333.8s)]
*  and you're wondering, [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5336.5199999999995s)]
*  well, what are these people actually doing? [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5337.44s)]
*  Are they just, what does a DEI department actually do [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5338.639999999999s)]
*  inside of a company that is a creative or valuable? [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5343.12s)]
*  It creates more bureaucracy to do more DEI. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5346.12s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5349.44s)]
*  If it's on itself, [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5350.28s)]
*  and that's why I keep saying bigger and bigger. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5351.12s)]
*  Did you guys see the size of the Michigan DEI group? [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5351.94s)]
*  Did you see that tweet? [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5354.0s)]
*  I thought that was a, [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5355.08s)]
*  I thought this was a Babylon Bee story when I first saw it [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5356.36s)]
*  because there are 250 people working for have DEI. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5358.72s)]
*  500 people at Michigan. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5363.6s)]
*  What? [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5364.84s)]
*  At what's the denominator? [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5366.0s)]
*  500 out of how many people? [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5367.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know, but they're spending $30 million [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5369.08s)]
*  on payroll and benefits. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5370.64s)]
*  I mean, look, big companies can kind of afford this stuff, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5373.160000000001s)]
*  but startups cannot. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5376.96s)]
*  I mean, this is really the kiss of death for startups. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5378.320000000001s)]
*  You just can't afford to have these large bureaucracies. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5381.04s)]
*  And then also, when you're a startup founder, [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5384.240000000001s)]
*  if you have six months of runway, 12 months of runway, [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5388.280000000001s)]
*  you might not have the luxury to be looking [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5390.96s)]
*  at your statistics and saying, you know what? [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5392.76s)]
*  We've got 10 people who are of this demographic. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5395.08s)]
*  Statistically, we should have this. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5399.88s)]
*  So the next hire we need to make our sales numbers [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5402.04s)]
*  has to be of this composure. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5405.5199999999995s)]
*  And I've had seen people do this act. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5407.24s)]
*  You've probably seen it too on boards or whatever. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5409.32s)]
*  Hey, we need to hire more of this type of person, [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5411.44s)]
*  this profile, and then hiring gets slowed. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5414.44s)]
*  And yeah, it's challenging and it's also illegal. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5418.24s)]
*  So I don't know how you win in this thing [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5423.08s)]
*  other than have a colorblind society as a goal at least. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5426.72s)]
*  You know, and to put your efforts. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5429.6s)]
*  Are you familiar with a Mott and Bailey tactic? [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5432.160000000001s)]
*  No, Tom. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5436.160000000001s)]
*  Have you heard of this? [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5437.0s)]
*  This is a rhetorical technique or fallacy. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5437.84s)]
*  No, I haven't heard this one. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5442.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I love a good. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5443.12s)]
*  So this comes from medieval times. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5444.4400000000005s)]
*  The Mott and Bailey was a type of castle [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5446.72s)]
*  where the Bailey was this wider area [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5448.64s)]
*  that was just defended by a wooden wall. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5451.280000000001s)]
*  So it's not that secure. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5453.12s)]
*  The Mott was basically the stone fortress on the hill. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5454.4800000000005s)]
*  So a Mott and Bailey tactic is when you go out [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5459.679999999999s)]
*  and stake out a very aggressive position. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5463.08s)]
*  You take the Bailey basically, [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5464.879999999999s)]
*  but then when you get challenged, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5466.08s)]
*  you retreat into the Mott [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5467.639999999999s)]
*  and pretend like you never took the Bailey position. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5469.36s)]
*  The Bailey position is basically the Kendi style anti-racism [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5472.24s)]
*  where you say, look, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5477.12s)]
*  we have to achieve proportional representation [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5477.959999999999s)]
*  in every job category. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5480.839999999999s)]
*  And that is what the DI movement in the main advocates for. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5482.32s)]
*  But then when they get challenged [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5487.44s)]
*  by somebody like Elon or by somebody like the Supreme Court, [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5490.24s)]
*  they retreat into the Mott and just say, [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5492.44s)]
*  no, no, no, we weren't trying to do that. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5494.12s)]
*  We're just trying to expand the pool of qualified applicants [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5495.48s)]
*  because who could be against that? [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5499.08s)]
*  And they'll claim that they were never doing [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5501.04s)]
*  the whole proportional representation thing. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5503.24s)]
*  And then on top of it, they'll say, well, listen, [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5504.759999999999s)]
*  obviously increasing the pool of qualified applicants [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5507.08s)]
*  is so unobjectionable that if you're against that, [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5510.679999999999s)]
*  then you must be racist. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5514.12s)]
*  And then you get all the accusations. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5515.4s)]
*  This is basically the rhetorical technique [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5517.8s)]
*  that the movement uses to defend itself. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5520.2s)]
*  But eventually when this stuff gets litigated, [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5523.28s)]
*  as it just did at the Supreme Court, [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5525.4400000000005s)]
*  you start to pick this apart [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5527.6s)]
*  and you see that there's a lot of evidence [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5528.72s)]
*  that they are actually engaged in overt discrimination [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5530.360000000001s)]
*  against certain groups like Asian Americans. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5534.2s)]
*  No easy answers here, [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5539.16s)]
*  but I for one think that that's bad. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5540.08s)]
*  Yeah, there was something really nice [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5542.64s)]
*  about a merit-based society [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5544.52s)]
*  if there was fairness at the starting line. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5546.96s)]
*  But that's the thing I've learned [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5548.84s)]
*  is not everybody starts at the same place. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5550.68s)]
*  And so if you just look at, it seems to me, [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5552.88s)]
*  listen, I'm no expert, [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5555.4400000000005s)]
*  but the starting line seems to matter most. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5557.68s)]
*  So if we could focus on making it as equal [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5559.52s)]
*  and fair and just when it comes to education, [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5562.76s)]
*  that seems to me to be the quickest solution [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5566.32s)]
*  to feeling better about all this. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5568.68s)]
*  I just think we should have seven-day, [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5570.72s)]
*  365-day a year school available, [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5572.6s)]
*  public school available, [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5575.68s)]
*  competitive schools available [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5576.96s)]
*  to make the world more just [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5578.240000000001s)]
*  and give people more opportunity, right? [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5580.400000000001s)]
*  Skills training, et cetera. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5582.400000000001s)]
*  Why do you think that having school 365 days a year [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5583.6s)]
*  will make the world more just? [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5587.6s)]
*  Well, because I do think that [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5589.88s)]
*  if you had more competition in schools [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5591.5s)]
*  and you had parents who care or students who care [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5593.72s)]
*  and they could get more education [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5597.12s)]
*  and there was more available, [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5598.84s)]
*  then you could say, well, [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5600.8s)]
*  how many days a week did you go to school? [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5602.72s)]
*  How much effort did you put in? [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5604.32s)]
*  And there was just more high-quality school available. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5606.0s)]
*  And if you look at public schools right now, [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5608.639999999999s)]
*  it's very unjust how poor the schools are [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5610.639999999999s)]
*  and how poorly run they are [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5614.0s)]
*  and what the teachers unions have done to these schools [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5615.28s)]
*  in disadvantaged communities. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5617.36s)]
*  And if I look back on my life [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5619.08s)]
*  and I look at people who did well, [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5622.34s)]
*  they had engaged parents [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5624.42s)]
*  and they had opportunities in education [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5625.639999999999s)]
*  that other people didn't. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5628.28s)]
*  And that seems- [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5629.5199999999995s)]
*  How does keeping the school open all year round change that? [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5630.96s)]
*  You think about parents who maybe don't have coverage [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5634.4800000000005s)]
*  for their kids after 2.30 or three o'clock. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5637.4800000000005s)]
*  And then those kids, [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5639.88s)]
*  we were called latchkey kids, I think, [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5642.04s)]
*  in the 80s and 90s. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5643.84s)]
*  You're having the ability for them [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5645.68s)]
*  to do more enriching things, to be in chess club, [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5646.84s)]
*  to be in taekwondo club, to do a little extra math, [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5648.96s)]
*  whatever it is. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5652.08s)]
*  That could be something society could do [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5653.6s)]
*  for a very low cost or skills training even, right? [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5655.4s)]
*  Hey, this is a culinary school after school. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5657.64s)]
*  This is a culinary school on the weekends. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5659.96s)]
*  This is a coding school on the weekends. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5661.36s)]
*  It doesn't have to be just STEM. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5662.8s)]
*  It could be welding. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5663.8s)]
*  It could be, like I said, [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5665.08s)]
*  it could be design, whatever it is. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5667.76s)]
*  More opportunities for people to learn more skills [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5669.32s)]
*  without having the benchmark be, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5672.56s)]
*  my parents can afford Kuman. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5674.92s)]
*  My parents can afford a chess tutor, right? [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5676.36s)]
*  We live in a time of incredible privilege [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5678.12s)]
*  and all of us have unlimited resources. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5680.76s)]
*  And many of the people who listen to this podcast [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5683.32s)]
*  have a lot of resources to hire tutors for their kids [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5684.8s)]
*  and give them more opportunity. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5687.6s)]
*  I didn't have that opportunity, you know? [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5688.44s)]
*  And if I had that opportunity, [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5690.48s)]
*  I would have learned chess faster, right? [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5691.839999999999s)]
*  I would have had more opportunity for you. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5694.32s)]
*  Just wasn't available to me. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5695.96s)]
*  And then there's a lot of people who started behind me [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5697.679999999999s)]
*  who certainly didn't have it available. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5699.839999999999s)]
*  Single parent, you know, in a worse school environment [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5701.5599999999995s)]
*  than Brooklyn where I grew up. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5705.48s)]
*  So I don't know, do you disagree, Jemar? [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5707.639999999999s)]
*  Would you have a better idea [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5710.04s)]
*  of how to make the world more fair and just [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5711.0s)]
*  than education and skills training? [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5713.12s)]
*  I think education is probably the most important. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5715.679999999999s)]
*  I do think that we need to find it fashionable again [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5718.76s)]
*  to have nuclear families. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5723.599999999999s)]
*  I think that if you look at the marriage rates [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5726.2s)]
*  of 20 and 30 year olds, it's meaningfully depressed [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5728.92s)]
*  relative to older cohorts, including ours. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5733.36s)]
*  We're the last generation where it's a structural part [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5735.92s)]
*  of our identity is being married. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5739.12s)]
*  And I think that that has long-term implications [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5741.84s)]
*  because when you look at the success rates [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5744.52s)]
*  of how to grow kids, poverty matters a lot less [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5747.160000000001s)]
*  than having a structural nuclear family, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5750.240000000001s)]
*  meaning a two-parent household. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5752.6s)]
*  And so I think that there's a lot of work we need to do [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5755.72s)]
*  to figure out how to re-incentivize folks [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5758.4800000000005s)]
*  to want to commit to a single person, [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5762.400000000001s)]
*  not this rampant promiscuity, but just kind of lock down [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5764.6s)]
*  and find somebody and build a long-term partnership [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5768.64s)]
*  with them. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5770.92s)]
*  I think that that's really crucial [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5771.76s)]
*  for a functioning society. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5772.96s)]
*  Do you think tax incentives is the way to do that [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5775.24s)]
*  or just cultural norms? [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5776.12s)]
*  I haven't studied the problem to have an idea about that. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5779.2s)]
*  I've heard this before. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5781.92s)]
*  I just don't know how that gets implemented in society. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5782.759999999999s)]
*  And I can think of ways that tutoring [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5786.12s)]
*  and having more education available, vouchers, et cetera. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5788.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, if you gave every parent [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5791.799999999999s)]
*  under a certain dollar amount of income a year [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5793.719999999999s)]
*  a voucher to hire tutors, [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5796.719999999999s)]
*  man, that could change the world. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5798.32s)]
*  It could change a lot of people's fate. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5801.2s)]
*  We need more two-parent households. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5802.68s)]
*  That would certainly help more. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5805.16s)]
*  All right, well, we really got into it here in the end, man. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5806.96s)]
*  What a great episode. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5809.68s)]
*  All right, four, the Rain Man, David Sacks. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5812.12s)]
*  With a tight haircut now, the dream is over. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5815.8s)]
*  I mean, it's just- [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5818.8s)]
*  It's a new year. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5820.240000000001s)]
*  I don't know who got to you. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5821.08s)]
*  It's a new year. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5821.92s)]
*  It's an election year. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5823.400000000001s)]
*  It's a big year for you. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5824.4400000000005s)]
*  I gotta clean it up for the election. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5825.76s)]
*  I think it's just a huge critical mistake. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5828.12s)]
*  I think you were going to a certain iconic look [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5830.36s)]
*  and I think you've blown it. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5833.799999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna take the other side of that bet. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5834.88s)]
*  And for David Freeberg, the CEO of Ohalo [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5838.0s)]
*  and Trimoth Polyhapitiya, [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5840.679999999999s)]
*  the founder of the new 8090 incubator [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5842.28s)]
*  and the chairman dictator of the all in LLC, [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5846.44s)]
*  I am the world's greatest moderator. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5850.84s)]
*  Yes, you are. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5853.639999999999s)]
*  And Angela Vester. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5854.48s)]
*  And we'll see you on next time. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5855.679999999999s)]
*  Bye-bye. Love you, boys. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5856.799999999999s)]
*  Love you, boys. Bye-bye. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5857.96s)]
*  Bye-bye. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5858.799999999999s)]
*  We'll let your winners ride. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5860.6s)]
*  Rain Man, David Sacks. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5863.52s)]
*  And instead, we open sourced it to the fans [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5867.8s)]
*  and they've just gone crazy with it. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5870.08s)]
*  Love you, Westies. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5871.92s)]
*  The queen of Kenwa. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5872.76s)]
*  I'm going all in. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5874.04s)]
*  Let your winners ride. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5875.6s)]
*  Let your winners ride. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5876.88s)]
*  Let your winners ride. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5879.08s)]
*  Besties are gone. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5880.72s)]
*  Go 13. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5881.84s)]
*  That's my dog taking a notice in your driveway. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5882.68s)]
*  Sacks. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5885.4400000000005s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5886.280000000001s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5887.12s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5887.96s)]
*  My avid master will meet me at Wednesday. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5889.32s)]
*  We should all just get a room [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5891.24s)]
*  and just have one big huge orgy [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5892.32s)]
*  because they're all just... [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5893.92s)]
*  It's like this sexual tension [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5894.759999999999s)]
*  that they just need to release somehow. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5896.639999999999s)]
*  What? [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=5899.24s)]
