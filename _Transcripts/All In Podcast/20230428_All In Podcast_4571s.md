# E126 Big Tech blow-out, Powell’s recession warning, lab-grown meat, RFK Jr shakes up race & more
**All In Podcast:** [April 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY)
*  I can't wait to talk about lab grown meat. I had been trying to get people to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=0.0s)]
*  please don't let's not get canceled. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=10.08s)]
*  But the four of us are functional again, we'd like each other we enjoy we look forward to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=14.0s)]
*  doing the show again everything styled in is your lab grown meats that use hormones. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  My lab grown meat was a little. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=23.52s)]
*  Let me ask you this about your lab grown meat. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=24.8s)]
*  Do you have. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=29.12s)]
*  At this age. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=33.36s)]
*  No, no, no, no, you know, I was told that my lab grown meat was a little. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=34.56s)]
*  I've injected some flavors of tobacco black cherry. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=42.16s)]
*  Some notes. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=46.8s)]
*  Some notes. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Parsimmons. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=48.32s)]
*  Let your winter slide. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=54.8s)]
*  Rain man David. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=57.44s)]
*  So let's go to big tech earnings. Google stock is up 5% after beating on the top line and bottom [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=69.84s)]
*  line estimates some high level takeaways Google announced a $70 billion stock buyback plan, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  and that their cloud unit was profitable for the first time in its history. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=81.92s)]
*  So we mentioned last week, Sundar officially announced that deep mind was merging with brain. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=85.76s)]
*  This is kind of controversial because it's really hard, according to some sources, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=92.0s)]
*  for Sundar to get all his lieutenants to work together and row in the right direction. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=97.76s)]
*  Google's Q on search revenue up year over year 2% down 5% quarter over quarter, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=102.48s)]
*  expected because of seasonality and because we're in a down market right now, obviously, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  with the recession. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  YouTube down 2.5% year over year down 16% quarter of a quarter other bets, which is like nest [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  and some other products down 35% year over year. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=124.0s)]
*  Net income $15 billion. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  Any thoughts? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=131.28s)]
*  Freeberg on what is a mixed quarter by Google? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=132.24s)]
*  And I guess the wider macro environment. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=136.88s)]
*  What was so striking about the earnings call is not necessarily what was presented, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  but what was not presented, which was a stronger voice in a strategic plan going forward for [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=144.08s)]
*  dealing with two major issues of the company. One is the operating cost model. And the second is [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  the AI strategy and the response to this evolution in AI. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=155.84s)]
*  I've heard from a lot of folks that the AI strategy in particular, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=159.28s)]
*  it's almost like Google already has this in the bag, but they just haven't kind of let it out of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=164.16000000000003s)]
*  the bag. It's like they've got a Tasmanian devil and they're ready to go with it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=168.96s)]
*  And there's from my read, an incredible amount of confidence that there's something that's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=172.56s)]
*  going to happen. And a set of things that are going to happen, they're going to be very [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=176.88000000000002s)]
*  profound and powerful. I even heard some anecdotal stories about, hey, you know, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=180.24s)]
*  we don't have this feature in this product, but chat GPT does. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=186.16000000000003s)]
*  And then people basically showed up to this meeting and there was all this debate about, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=189.68s)]
*  well, we can't let it out because we're not sure, you know, that the classic kind of like, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=194.08s)]
*  we're scared of doing wrong versus leaning forward and taking risks. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=196.88s)]
*  Don't be evil. You're referencing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=201.28s)]
*  No, it was just more about regulatory concern and getting things wrong and making a mistake. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=203.44s)]
*  And so there's this total fear of like, again, you know, regulatory and fear. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=207.52s)]
*  So someone kind of slammed the table and said, let's just put it out. And the next day they [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=211.12s)]
*  put it out. So there's definitely a cultural change happening internally is what I've heard [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  anecdotally, but what was really missing, which is what Wall Street needed to hear, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=216.96s)]
*  what investors and shareholders needed to hear is what's the strategy there? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=220.08s)]
*  How are you going to compete? How are you going to resolve what's going to go forward? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  And secondly, what are you going to do about the cost structure of the company? Because everyone [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=225.76000000000002s)]
*  else, you know, in contrast to Meta being up 11, 12% after hours with their cost cutting model and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=229.52s)]
*  demonstrating that they're going to start pulling cash out of this business. Google's [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=234.8s)]
*  top, you know, kind of top story was, hey, we're stopped serving peanut M&Ms in the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=238.0s)]
*  cafeteria or something ridiculous. And, you know, that doesn't really address the real structural [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  question. So I think the stock buyback, the $70 billion stock buyback is an authorization [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=246.48s)]
*  to repurchase. It's not a plan to repurchase. So it's unclear if when or how that capital does [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=252.64s)]
*  actually get deployed in the market to buy back stock. And so there is also this big kind of [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=258.4s)]
*  shareholder sentiment of being let down, that there isn't an improvement in either cash coming [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  out of the business, or in cash being used in a smart way with the business. And it was the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  silence in the earnings call that I think really stunned a lot of people, which is why you didn't [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=273.92s)]
*  see a lot of stock movement, despite the actual business numbers being better than expected. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  And so there's a lot that Google, I think, still has to catch up to with respect to their peers, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  both on a product and strategy point of view, but also on a cost cutting and a communication [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  of that cost cutting point of view to the market and to the street. Otherwise, shareholders are [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=294.72s)]
*  going to start to lose faith if they're not already, and are going to start to put their [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=299.44s)]
*  capital with other folks who they feel are better leading and leaning into this new [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=302.56s)]
*  evolution of technology like Microsoft and Apple and Meta, which is really where those big capital [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=306.72s)]
*  allocators end up picking stuff to go. One final thing I'll say, it's extraordinarily [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=314.4s)]
*  important to note that I think Google has such an incredible AI advantage over Microsoft. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=321.36s)]
*  And Microsoft is almost solely dependent on OpenAI, this small startup company, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  and all of Bing chats is powered by it. And Microsoft hasn't built out the infrastructure, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=332.64s)]
*  the team, the rigor, the depth, the models that Google has. And Google made a few strategic [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=338.32s)]
*  blunders. They shouldn't have been as open with the transformer work that they did and shared [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=345.44s)]
*  that publicly. It certainly enabled OpenAI and others to compete. But Google certainly has an [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=349.52s)]
*  incredible set of tools and capabilities that is leap years ahead of Microsoft. They're in a [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=354.8s)]
*  position to really compete. They just have to have the will and the leadership to do it, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  slam the table, say here's we're going to stop wasting money, and we're going to start leading [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=363.52000000000004s)]
*  and driving this industry forward. And this could be a quick turnaround story for the stock [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  and for this company. And I hope it'll happen. Chimath, what are your thoughts on [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=372.24s)]
*  Google's leadership specifically? Is Sundar the right person to run the company going forward? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=377.44s)]
*  Does he have the founder authority to get the ship and to get the lieutenants all kind of rowing [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=382.48s)]
*  in the same direction? Does it need to be a leadership change, which is the big discussion [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  of topic in Silicon Valley right now? I think he's very capable. That's an [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=390.88s)]
*  amorphous organization of so many different competing interests. The thing that doesn't add [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=394.88s)]
*  up about the Google earnings release, but then also what Freebird just mentioned is, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=401.52000000000004s)]
*  Freebird just mentioned is there was this article that kind of tried to paint Sundar as sort of a [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=408.8s)]
*  caretaker CEO, right, where Larry was the actual shadow CEO. Well, if that's true, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  you know, Larry has more incentive than anybody else to kind of force change. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=421.04s)]
*  And there was all these kind of like gripes and complaints that were articulated. And I don't put [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=427.52000000000004s)]
*  much stock in all of this stuff. I think that he is the right person for the job. And I think what [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=431.20000000000005s)]
*  they have to do is just do the simple basic things. Like it doesn't take a CEO change [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=437.84s)]
*  for a board of directors to have the emotional wherewithal to authorize a 15 or 20% reduction [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=444.32s)]
*  in force for a company that is so profitable, that clearly is not yet humming on all cylinders. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=451.76s)]
*  And so you don't need to go through all of this drastic change to do these simple, obvious things. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=459.67999999999995s)]
*  My takeaway across all of these four big companies is we are in a really unique moment to observe [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=466.32000000000005s)]
*  something that may sound controversial or hurt people's feelings that like these companies. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=473.44s)]
*  But I think we're now well past peak big tech. Their valuations may still go up because they [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=480.0s)]
*  generate such an enormous amount of cash flow. But these are exactly those kinds of businesses [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=486.72s)]
*  now. They are X growth, large cash flow businesses. Blue chip, you might say? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=492.16s)]
*  Well, they were always blue chip, but the way that they grow is not through innovation. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=498.16s)]
*  If you look at Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple, and ask yourself when was the last hugely [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=501.92s)]
*  disruptive thing that they've created, you're hard pressed to find something that was even done in [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=509.12s)]
*  the 2010s. Yeah, actually, that's a good thought. I mean, the iPhone for Apple. iPhone was 2007. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=514.48s)]
*  Microsoft was in the 1990s. Google was in 1998 with Core Search. Maybe there was maps and Gmail [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=520.56s)]
*  and in the 2000s. Chrome, Android, they bought some of that. Facebook, it was the Core service [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=527.76s)]
*  that we built in the 2000s. And then they acquired brilliantly, right? So I'm not saying that they [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=533.6s)]
*  didn't acquire well. Yeah, my point is that core organic innovation hasn't been there for a long [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=538.0799999999999s)]
*  time. So this is a moment to just be reflective of the fact that these are some incredible companies [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=543.76s)]
*  with ginormous cash flows. But now you've had this foundational platform shift, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  which exposes the fact that they really aren't good at innovating. And at times when they've [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=556.16s)]
*  tried to organically innovate, they've massively misallocated capital. Either through a bloated [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=561.92s)]
*  balance sheet, so some would claim that Google overspends, or through just pure misallocation [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=570.3199999999999s)]
*  by starting projects that just are not large, but consume large amounts of cash. That would [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=574.64s)]
*  be the Facebook VR example. But in all of this, I think when you cut staff and expenses [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=578.64s)]
*  as a way to meet and beat and top line growth is in the low single digits, it's an important [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=587.28s)]
*  moment to recognize that these companies have now transitioned to being cash cows. And if you look [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=593.92s)]
*  at sort of how financial markets value cash cows, they're very valuable. But it's not where you look [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=600.4s)]
*  for growth. And so in a world where rates eventually get cut, and we start to come out of a recession, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=607.36s)]
*  it tends to be that other people get rewarded. So that's an idea that's [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=615.4399999999999s)]
*  adding to your point here. They're not allowed to acquire these Microsoft acquisition thing dead, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=618.56s)]
*  dead. So they're not going to be allowed to buy stuff. So then you're right. What is the growth [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=624.24s)]
*  here? They're not able to innovate. I think these companies are x growth, which is why [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=628.56s)]
*  they use their cash flows to do what borrow money cheaply to buy back stock to manipulate [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=633.28s)]
*  their equity, right? You can manipulate and overcome dilution, you can manipulate earnings [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=640.0799999999999s)]
*  per share, you can manipulate the number of shares outstanding. And so just by the nature [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=645.28s)]
*  of that whole game, a bunch of passive investors will end up buying more, which helps the active [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=650.7199999999999s)]
*  investors who own that stock. So it's a game. So if we're not in the world, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=655.28s)]
*  financial engineering would be the I mean, the most charitable way to say it, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=659.28s)]
*  we're in the financial engineering phase, which is fine. And by the way, you can make a lot of [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=663.52s)]
*  money, Facebook's up 90%. So there's a lot of there's a lot of meaning just this just this year. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=666.48s)]
*  Oh, yes. So there's a lot of room for financial engineering, but it's not where you need to look [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=672.88s)]
*  to figure out where these big improvements and uses of this next generation platform technology [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=678.24s)]
*  are going to come from most likely. Sax is this a fair assessment in your mind looking at, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=685.12s)]
*  you know, the the major tech companies, the fangs? Yeah, I mean, their growth is down to [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=689.52s)]
*  single digits. So I think Microsoft had 7% year over year revenue growth. Google was at 3%. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=692.96s)]
*  I think Facebook was sales rose three 3% from a year earlier. But at least that was an improvement [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=699.84s)]
*  because it's actually gone down for three straight quarters. So yeah, but you're down to, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=707.52s)]
*  you know, single digit year over year growth rates. Nevertheless, most of these companies [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=712.16s)]
*  beat expectations. So Microsoft shares rose 9%. Meta jumped 12% might be up more now. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=717.36s)]
*  And I guess Google got a little bit of a bounce and they all gave a pretty upbeat forecast. The [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=726.3199999999999s)]
*  only one that wasn't upbeat was Google, where the CFO Ruth Porat said that the outlook remains [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=731.4399999999999s)]
*  uncertain. But all the other ones seem to indicate that things are going to get better. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=739.04s)]
*  So I think what's interesting about that is just the mismatch that we have between how well these [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=745.12s)]
*  companies did in this quarter versus how uncertain the rest of the economy is looking right now. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=750.0s)]
*  And maybe the Fed's behavior. Yeah, so maybe this is the flip side. What [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=755.36s)]
*  Jamath is saying is they're not growing very fast, but they are profitable machines generating a lot [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=759.28s)]
*  of earnings. And they seem to be pretty immune from what's happening in the economy right now. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=764.0799999999999s)]
*  Or at least that's what they're saying. Now, you're right in a parallel track, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=769.28s)]
*  there was an interesting interview that pal did. So drone pal gave an interview. It was actually [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=773.1999999999999s)]
*  kind of like one of these hoax calls where a couple of people pretending to be [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=780.64s)]
*  salinski engagement and interview. Oh my god, that was crazy. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=785.52s)]
*  You want to explain that reference? Oh my god, what is happening? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=789.92s)]
*  They've done this a number of times where they've gotten, you know, major leaders. I think they did [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=793.5999999999999s)]
*  this to Macron, some other people where they pretend to be salinski and they do an interview. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=796.88s)]
*  It's like ollie g. Yeah, but they played it straight. I don't care that he was fooled into [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=801.4399999999999s)]
*  giving the interview. It's like who cares? But some of the things he said were really interesting. I [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=805.12s)]
*  mean, number one, how said that the economic outlook for the year was looking pretty uncertain. And [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=808.88s)]
*  he said the most likely scenarios were either sub 1% growth. So staying out of recession, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=816.32s)]
*  but just barely or he said going into recession. So he thought that was roughly about equally [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=822.16s)]
*  likely. He admitted that we had the worst inflation of 40 years and that's why interest rates were [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=828.16s)]
*  necessary. And he said that it was necessary to slow the economy in order to combat inflation. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=831.92s)]
*  And he then even went further and said that it was necessary to cool off the labor market and even to [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=837.04s)]
*  cool off wages specifically, because that's how you combat inflation. That's the only thing we know [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=843.76s)]
*  how to do in a situation like this. So I think this is certainly a political mistake for Powell [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=848.0s)]
*  to say that his objective here is to hurt the wages of the American people and to basically [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=854.4s)]
*  cause a recession. But that is his view, apparently. And I think that we are headed for it seems like [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=859.36s)]
*  a recession. I'm a little surprised that the earnings reports for these tech companies are [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=865.68s)]
*  so good because early their forecasts are so good. Well, they can cut spending. And we talked about [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=869.04s)]
*  this last year when we were trying to predict what would happen. I remember saying, well, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=873.6s)]
*  I think Tramatha and I were talking about this and I said, well, Tramatha saying, hey, earnings [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=878.0s)]
*  are going to go down and there's a PE and I said, what if they just stop spending or they make a lot [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=881.28s)]
*  of cuts? Well, here we are, people are just saying, you know what, we're going to cut our way [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=884.88s)]
*  to and do stock buybacks. And that's another way of financial engineering [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=890.8000000000001s)]
*  to route around the Fed, right. And to and to make the stock go up. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=896.08s)]
*  Worked incredible for Facebook. I mean, my Lord, they were at $91 a share and now they're over 200. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=900.24s)]
*  Right. But just to bring it back to the economy. So look, I think we agreed that these tech companies [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=907.44s)]
*  seem to be pretty immune. They've got a large cushion in terms of their ability to continue [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=912.32s)]
*  generating earnings because of all the bloat that actually gives them like a margin of error where [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=916.32s)]
*  they can just keep cutting to prop up earnings. I'm a little surprised that they think their revenue [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=920.88s)]
*  forecasts are going to be so positive because again, they were guiding upwards generally. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=925.12s)]
*  So they seem to think they're not going to be impacted by the recession and maybe they won't [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=929.12s)]
*  be again. I think what was interesting from Powell is the way that he seemed to think that the only [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=932.32s)]
*  thing we know how to do this is basically what he said. The only thing we know how to do in the [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=938.96s)]
*  situation with inflation is to kill the economy. It's a slow the economy and specifically to kill [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=942.24s)]
*  jobs and wages. And that was pretty remarkable to me because there are other things we could do. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=947.92s)]
*  Such as? Okay, well, one thing is that you don't have to print so much money. Cut spending austerity. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=954.16s)]
*  So yes, our fiscal policy remains completely out of whack. We're running $2 trillion annual deficits [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=959.4399999999999s)]
*  right now, past COVID. So he could have said, listen, we could get off this reckless fiscal [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=965.12s)]
*  policy and be more restrained, but he didn't want to go there. The other thing he could have done [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=970.7199999999999s)]
*  was address the supply side. One of the ways that you can reduce inflation, it's not just to kill [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=975.28s)]
*  demand, you could actually affect supply chains. So like cost of energy, for example, energy is a [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=980.08s)]
*  huge input into the economy. And one of the things that happened at the beginning of this administration [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=983.2800000000001s)]
*  is they made it much harder to drill for oil and gas. And I think Biden sort of reversed course on [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=988.48s)]
*  that at the state of the union. Remember, he had that line where he said, we can't get off oil and [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=994.1600000000001s)]
*  gas for 10 years and the audience started laughing. But in any event, the point is just that it's too [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=998.72s)]
*  little too late. They could have done more on energy to keep costs down. And so he could have [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1003.2s)]
*  on energy to keep costs low. And then there's a whole bunch of other critical inputs into the [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1008.64s)]
*  economy besides labor. And what you could do is, I think you could go category by category and say, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1012.72s)]
*  how do we get the price of these key inputs into our economy down? How do we resolve supply chain [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1019.76s)]
*  bottlenecks? How do we make it easier to get access to whatever the key commodity is? And I [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1024.16s)]
*  think there's things they could do if they're just willing to work at it. Maybe this isn't the Fed's [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1030.6399999999999s)]
*  job. This is more the administration. But what you could do is say, listen, we're going to make it [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1033.92s)]
*  easier for people to produce and create supply. And if you have a higher supply of goods and services, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1038.56s)]
*  then you will start to bring inflation down because inflation is just the amount of money in the [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1044.08s)]
*  system divided by the amount of goods and services. And when the amount of goods and services [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1050.72s)]
*  hasn't gone up, but the money supply has gone up tremendously, you're going to have inflation. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1055.52s)]
*  And that's why I think it's a little bit misplaced to be killing demand the way they're killing it is [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1059.9199999999998s)]
*  because fundamentally, the problem here is they flooded the economy with money, both through [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1063.44s)]
*  government stimulus and through quantitative easing. And then also, they made it harder on [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1070.0s)]
*  the supply side to produce, certainly with energy. So it seems to me that the approach they're taking [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1074.8s)]
*  for us to get out of this, it's like taking a meat cleaver to the economy, or a sledgehammer, really. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1079.44s)]
*  And it's the most violent possible way that they could solve the problem they previously created [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1086.0s)]
*  of too much inflation. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1091.2s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell And the other thing, obviously, is jobs. We're still sitting here with close to [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1092.32s)]
*  10 million job openings. And the thing I'm hearing from the streets is that unemployment hacking [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1096.64s)]
*  is become a high art. And so labor force participation remains low. It's nowhere near [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1105.04s)]
*  the historic highs. We have been very permissive during COVID for good reasons to give people very [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1110.96s)]
*  extended benefits. People have now learned is my understanding. And this is something that's [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1116.56s)]
*  happening on a regional level, state by state level. People are learning how to hack unemployment [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1122.24s)]
*  and not going to work. And people are just not taking the jobs that are open, which are service [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1128.0s)]
*  industry jobs, Americans don't want to work them. We don't want to let people into the country got [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1132.0s)]
*  record low people coming into the country. It seems to me that would be a much more productive [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1136.1599999999999s)]
*  way to do this, right? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1140.24s)]
*  Pete Slauson Yes, I think it's an excellent point. Because exactly what you're doing there is [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1141.04s)]
*  addressing the supply side, which is you're unlocking the supply of a key input into the [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1144.96s)]
*  economy, which is all this unused labor. It's all these people aren't working. You're right, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1149.2s)]
*  the labor force participation rate is still much lower than it could be. So, if you get more people [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1153.3600000000001s)]
*  into the economy, then that helps alleviate the cost of labor, it helps fill these jobs, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1158.0s)]
*  but it doesn't kill the economy. So, it would be a much more positive way to address this. So, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1163.8400000000001s)]
*  I just think it showed a lack of creativity for him to say that the only thing we can do [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1169.2s)]
*  in this situation is not just to raise rates. He did say that, but to go further and cool off [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1173.6000000000001s)]
*  the job market, increase unemployment, and cool off wages. I mean, that's going to be a very [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1181.28s)]
*  unpopular thing to say, I think, because what you're basically saying is you're going to hurt [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1187.52s)]
*  the wages of the American people. Who wants that? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1191.2s)]
*  Aaron Ross Here's the chart for job openings. We thought this would collapse. It went down, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1193.3600000000001s)]
*  certainly, as we, you know, I don't want to obsess over macro stuff, but it's still way up there. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1197.84s)]
*  And so, the fact that we can't get people to take these jobs, I don't know, Chamath, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1203.6s)]
*  what do you think about the employment and participation situation and how that might [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1207.6s)]
*  unlock things? I also wanted to know from you, Chamath, this concept of the Fed is reacting to [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1213.04s)]
*  data just so slowly. And then you have these companies that maybe are more nimble and they [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1219.52s)]
*  have better data than the Fed. Chamath P. And I think that that's a truism. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1224.32s)]
*  And I don't think anything about that is going to change. I mean, I think we talked about [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1227.76s)]
*  how these folks calculate nonfarm payrolls or how they calculate CPI. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1231.9199999999998s)]
*  It's incredibly outdated, right? It's people with clipboards walking around talking to people and [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1237.28s)]
*  checking boxes and filling out forms. Can that change? Probably, it could. Will it change? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1242.1599999999999s)]
*  It probably won't. And so, they're going to focus on the most simple but most powerful measure that [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1249.52s)]
*  they have, which is controlling the money supply, kind of what Sachs talked about. So, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1256.56s)]
*  they're going to manipulate the money supply to either put more liquidity in the system, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1260.6399999999999s)]
*  in which case markets go up and asset prices go up, but then inflation goes up, or constrain [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1265.6s)]
*  liquidity, which then causes markets to go down, asset prices to go down, and inflation eventually [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1270.6399999999999s)]
*  to go down. The thing that we're facing today when you look at this labor market chart is a couple of [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1275.84s)]
*  things that I think we've talked about before. And I just want to reiterate them, which is [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1281.04s)]
*  you have to remember that we are in this new world order, which is the ex-China world order. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1284.8000000000002s)]
*  And in that, there is no more unitary economy that can do things cheaper, faster, and better [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1292.16s)]
*  globally around the world, right? So, we're going to nearshore or onshore all kinds of things that [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1297.3600000000001s)]
*  used to be done by the Chinese. They'll sit in Mexico or they'll sit in Central America. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1302.8000000000002s)]
*  Maybe in some cases, they'll sit in Canada, and all of that will feed into the United States. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1308.4s)]
*  The problem with all of that is that that will keep costs higher because it'll be naturally more [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1312.56s)]
*  inefficient. It will naturally take more money, and that will naturally cause the prices of those [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1317.6799999999998s)]
*  things to be higher, which means that terminal inflation, I think, is just roughly higher. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1325.28s)]
*  As a result, I think that more power, if you will, goes to labor. So, in this constant tension, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1330.32s)]
*  that we have in an economy between labor and capital, the people that own the factories or [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1340.48s)]
*  the businesses and the people that run them and work inside of them, we've been in this position [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1344.56s)]
*  where the pendulum has swung so far towards capital, the owners, the shareholders, that [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1348.8s)]
*  all this financial engineering has tremendous upside, right? That's why companies engage in it. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1354.16s)]
*  But when you show that chart, Jason, what it means is it's just really hard to find people. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1360.32s)]
*  And so, the only way you're going to get people off their butt to go into work, to sit in a chair, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1363.84s)]
*  to do a job that you need them to do is to pay them more. And in finding that, wages will have [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1368.24s)]
*  to go up. The counterbalance of that is what AI will do, which I think we all agree is— [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1373.6s)]
*  I was about to say that is the key. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1379.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1381.1200000000001s)]
*  Which is massively deflationary. So, that is going to be the tension that we're in now for a really [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1381.6s)]
*  long time as we explore this. I don't know if you guys saw today, but Sequoia led a $20 million [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1386.72s)]
*  round in this thing called Harvey.AI. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1391.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1393.36s)]
*  Which is like a legal super wizard for law firms. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1393.52s)]
*  Yeah, we knew that was coming. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1396.1599999999999s)]
*  And my partners and I were debating it. And what we thought of was, well, how much do you pay [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1397.36s)]
*  out of the $800 or $1000 an hour that you charge to Harvey.AI? Maybe you're willing to pay 5% or 10%. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1403.92s)]
*  But then the reality is that one of the most powerful things it does is it's able to go into [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1411.36s)]
*  Westlaw, find all these cases, and say, yeah, this is germane to the thing that you're working on [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1416.8000000000002s)]
*  right now. That's a very useful thing. But the end plus first law firm will also use that tool. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1422.0800000000002s)]
*  And instead of charging $800 an hour, they'll say, well, we'll charge $600 an hour, and we're still [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1426.96s)]
*  willing to give you 5% or 10%. So, I just don't see a world where, on the one hand, physical labor [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1431.3600000000001s)]
*  will continue to be more expensive. They'll demand more labor. They'll demand more labor. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1438.72s)]
*  We'll continue to be more expensive. They'll demand more and more money to do the job that [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1443.2s)]
*  they're asked to do. And the knowledge work will become increasingly more deflationary, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1448.72s)]
*  because so much of it will be automated by AI, that those folks will charge less and less. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1453.6000000000001s)]
*  And there's going to be a tension there. And I don't exactly know what's going to happen. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1458.08s)]
*  I did a couple of experiments this week. I've been rolling up my sleeves and playing with these [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1461.2s)]
*  tools. It's pretty amazing. And I've been trying to use them for actual tasks in our companies. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1466.48s)]
*  What have you learned? What did you do? And what have you learned? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1473.04s)]
*  So, I got on the OpenAI plugins. Greg, thank you. I sent him my email, and he got me on to that. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1475.3600000000001s)]
*  And you can connect it to Zapier. So, I have two projects I'm working on currently. One of them, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1482.4s)]
*  I was, since I'm raising WatchFront 4, and I'm actually going out to people, not just taking [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1488.64s)]
*  inbound. I was like, hey, can I get the names of all the major LPs and start doing some research [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1492.96s)]
*  there, putting a table, stuff that's actually what he does blog post. But then I started connecting [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1497.68s)]
*  it with finding people's Twitter handles, finding their LinkedIn profiles. And then the next piece [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1502.72s)]
*  I'm working on is automatically following them, DMing them on Twitter, let's say, or following [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1510.24s)]
*  them on and doing an in message saying, hey, we haven't met. Here's the deal memo for my next fund, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1515.92s)]
*  would love to get together. This is sent from Jason's AI script. I was going to actually tell [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1521.28s)]
*  them, but here's my real email. If after you read the summary of the next fund you want to meet. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1526.56s)]
*  And then I was going to pair that and this is a piece I'm going to probably need a developer to [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1531.2s)]
*  do with our internal LP database to not email people who are already duplicates. And then inside [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1535.44s)]
*  with newsletters, I have it building a database of every newsletter we've ever sent, the writing [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1541.3600000000001s)]
*  style, and then I'm having it go find in real time news stories that we should be including in the [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1547.5200000000002s)]
*  newsletters, which I think will make the writers right now a third more productive. But these are [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1553.2800000000002s)]
*  things that would cost 4050 bucks an hour 30 bucks an hour for you know, college educated [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1558.88s)]
*  Americans and Canadians. And I have already figured out, and I'm not a developer anymore, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1564.5600000000002s)]
*  I had a script them and I'm actually thinking about learning to code again, just so I can do [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1570.0800000000002s)]
*  this myself. And so on Saturday, I'm going to do a little coding with a friend of mine and get back [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1574.5600000000002s)]
*  up to speed on that. I think about 30% of what knowledge workers do right now is possible. So I [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1579.6000000000001s)]
*  put every single person at both companies on chat GPT four, and this the playground, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1587.36s)]
*  about 30% of what knowledge workers at both firms can do currently is doable, if you can figure out [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1594.0s)]
*  and this stuff is not perfectly scripted yet. So I've been doing some stuff in travel as well, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1602.08s)]
*  playing with the kayak interface, Expedia interface, etc. To look at travel planning, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1606.1599999999999s)]
*  and it's pretty good as well. So it's, it's this is the real deal, folks, I think by the end of [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1613.52s)]
*  this year, 30% of knowledge work could be done by this. And then additionally, on Monday, I went [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1621.2s)]
*  back to work in person. And I went to, I hosted our accelerator in person. And then I hosted [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1627.6s)]
*  founding university in person in the city, the city was absolutely dead. But we had 100 people [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1634.48s)]
*  fly in from around the world for our founding university. And a lot of them are working on AI [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1640.4s)]
*  projects. And what's very interesting is like, there's this big debate going on. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1644.3200000000002s)]
*  Friedberg between is this going to be built into chat GPT four or Bard or you know, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1649.92s)]
*  PO or whatever it is, or should I even bother? So should I bother building, you know, a verticalized [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1654.96s)]
*  app? And it turns out like, I think you should do the verticalized app. And you're going to be able [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1661.2800000000002s)]
*  to put together multiple of these AIs that have different specialties. So I'm super stoked about [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1666.96s)]
*  it. But I do think if you're not using this, if you hear my voice right now, and you're a white collar [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1674.56s)]
*  worker, a knowledge worker, and you're not using this, this year and getting up to speed on it, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1679.3600000000001s)]
*  I think you'll be out of a job within the next two. Geez, wow. I just don't think you'll compete. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1684.16s)]
*  It would be like trying to compete without knowing how to use Microsoft Office 20 years ago, right? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1690.56s)]
*  Could you work and not know email? Remember when we came into the workforce 30 years ago, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1695.6000000000001s)]
*  and some people knew office and email, and web research and other people didn't, those other [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1700.48s)]
*  people retired, they were phased out. If you didn't know how to use a computer and type and [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1706.16s)]
*  use an Excel spreadsheet or do a PowerPoint, you were done. I think there's two possible ways you [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1710.48s)]
*  can interpret what you're saying. So in terms of the economic impact. So one is that you could say, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1714.3200000000002s)]
*  well, AI is going to do 30% of the knowledge work. Therefore, 30% of the knowledge workers [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1720.72s)]
*  are going to be put out of work. I think a different way to put it would be every knowledge [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1724.64s)]
*  worker can get 30% more work done. So if that's the case, then they're more productive. And we're [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1729.44s)]
*  just talking about the problem of how do you increase real wages in the economy without having [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1737.0400000000002s)]
*  inflation? Well, the way to do that is for every worker to be more productive. So if every worker [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1741.1200000000001s)]
*  is 30% more productive, in theory, their wages will go up by up to 30%. That's how you get [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1745.92s)]
*  wage growth. Now, maybe there will be some companies that don't need all those employees, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1752.0s)]
*  because now they're able to get, you know, whatever, a third more done. But there will [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1757.76s)]
*  be other companies who can hire them, they can go off and do other jobs for other companies, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1761.12s)]
*  especially when you've got this backlog of, like you said, eight or 10 million new, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1764.72s)]
*  you know, jobs that are on those jobs are all service, though. You know, they're not [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1768.32s)]
*  the you're actually going to have this big group of knowledge workers, there's just nothing for them [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1772.08s)]
*  to do. I just don't I agree with you. But I think there's going to be a group of knowledge workers [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1776.96s)]
*  who do not embrace this and do not make the transition because it is it's going to require [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1780.72s)]
*  an upscaling. Like I think you're actually going to need to know how to do some basic programming [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1786.08s)]
*  and coding to really take advantage of these at least like scripting level stuff. I don't know, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1790.24s)]
*  it's pretty easy to use. I agree with you there. Writing blog posts, but the date the example I [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1795.2s)]
*  gave of like taking the LP database, sorting it, you know, it's not quite very hard. This is like [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1800.08s)]
*  a chatbot. It is like I think it takes like level two programming skills. No, it doesn't. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1806.24s)]
*  No, you don't have to know how to program. You just have to know how to prompt it in natural [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1812.4s)]
*  language. It's the opposite of need to learn how to code. The thing that makes coding hard is that [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1815.52s)]
*  you have to learn the specific commands. It's like its own language. You have to learn a new language. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1820.48s)]
*  With this, you don't. In fact, one of the cool things about some of these open AI API's is that [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1824.96s)]
*  you just tell it what you want it to do. There's not even like a scripting language. A lot of it's [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1831.76s)]
*  natural language. And that makes it incredibly easy to use even for developers. So I don't think [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1835.92s)]
*  this is a hard technology to use. I agree with you there may be people who are resistant to it [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1842.96s)]
*  because there's always people who are resistant to change in new technology. And you're right, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1846.5600000000002s)]
*  if they don't adapt, they're going to be dinosaurs. But I don't think this is a hard technology to [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1850.4s)]
*  grok how to use and get benefit from. You might be right. I mean, right now, it's so new that the [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1855.44s)]
*  glue between systems is just not there yet. And maybe you'll be able to talk to chat GPT-4 and [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1862.08s)]
*  it'll connect your database on Notion. It will take a type form and a survey monkey and put it [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1868.08s)]
*  all together and figure that all out for you. Oh, yeah. That's the whole game right now is [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1873.1999999999998s)]
*  people connecting all these things. And that's what I'm talking about. And like that's kind of [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1876.6399999999999s)]
*  not there yet. But in the auto GPT stuff, you need a developer right now. But anyway, I'm deep in it. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1880.96s)]
*  And I am more excited right now. This feels to me like 2005 to 2012 period, when you just saw a [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1886.64s)]
*  jacks and the web and speed just all coming together so quickly. And the rapid iteration is [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1895.76s)]
*  just unbelievable. I every day I find a new use for it. I have made my default web page opening. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1903.2800000000002s)]
*  Like when I open a new page on my PC, it just opens chat GPT-4 now just so I am forcing myself [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1910.24s)]
*  to use it for every possible task. And the people who work for me, some of them are doing it, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1916.08s)]
*  most of them are not. And I'm just trying to drag everybody along. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1920.3999999999999s)]
*  And then you have at the same time, this remote work thing happening where salaries I'm finding [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1925.6799999999998s)]
*  are starting to normalize not across cities, but across countries. So, you know, hiring somebody [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1933.28s)]
*  in Canada, Estonia, San Paulo, and then you add this AI to it. The cost to do things is, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1941.68s)]
*  this is like, I don't know, I think everything's gonna cost about 10. All this knowledge work is [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1949.2s)]
*  going to be 10% as expensive to do. I don't think it's 10% less chamath or that, you know, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1953.8400000000001s)]
*  I think it's like 90% 10 cents on the dollar. I agree. And it's not this is not a five year, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1959.44s)]
*  10 year prediction. So it's like five quarter 10. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1967.44s)]
*  We said that the first organizations to use this like the Canary and the coal mine would be [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1971.04s)]
*  the consulting organizations. And today when Harvey got announced, one of the things that [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1976.0800000000002s)]
*  right on the heels of that PricewaterhouseCoopers announced like a billion dollar investment into [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1980.24s)]
*  AI, which makes sense because as a consulting organization full of lawyers and accountants and [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1984.48s)]
*  IT folks, those are the services jobs that you get tremendous leverage. If you were to use these [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1989.68s)]
*  tools. Freeberg, any thoughts? I don't know. I mean, I think we kind of beat this horse to death. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=1995.76s)]
*  We've talked about it for a couple of months and I think we just keep repeating ourselves. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2001.12s)]
*  Are you doing anything when you're firsthand? Are you playing with it yourself? Yeah. Look, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2005.2s)]
*  tell us about that. By the way, one thing I will say, we all talk about cost reduction and then, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2009.6s)]
*  oh, you know, knowledge work is dead and we're going to save money and all this stuff. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2014.32s)]
*  That is always the first reaction to any new point of leverage realized from some novel [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2019.36s)]
*  technology. The second is suddenly people start doing things that use that leverage to do things [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2024.64s)]
*  that they couldn't have done before. So it's not just about dropping costs. It's about enabling [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2032.4s)]
*  new things that does a hundred times more or unimaginable things prior. And I think the next [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2037.2800000000002s)]
*  phase of this AI shockwave that kind of hit us and hit the world and, you know, kind of hit enterprises [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2043.68s)]
*  is going to be the evolution of integrating those tools in a very unique way with other tools [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2051.2s)]
*  to drive very novel things forward, to create new things, new projects, new progress [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2057.6s)]
*  that was unfathomable before. So it's not just about cost savings. It's going to be about new [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2062.56s)]
*  stuff. I shared a link on Twitter yesterday. There's some guy, I want to quote him correctly. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2066.96s)]
*  His name is McKay Wrigley. So shout out to McKay on his Twitter page. It says that he didn't know [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2075.7599999999998s)]
*  how to code in 2019. He learned how to code for the first time he taught himself. And he put together [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2082.3199999999997s)]
*  an object recognition tool with chat GPT. I saw this video crazy with his webcam. And basically [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2090.96s)]
*  he holds up like a diet Coke and he's like, you know, tell me how many calories, what is this and [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2100.08s)]
*  how many calories are in it. And it's like, oh, there's no calories in it. It's a diet Coke. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2104.16s)]
*  And he does this three different times with three different objects. And he hacked this thing together [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2108.8799999999997s)]
*  in a couple of hours. That is a product that was like theoretically unfeasible or, you know, kind of [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2113.44s)]
*  very, very difficult to kind of see how you would put that piece together quickly and easily with [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2120.8799999999997s)]
*  one person in a room in a few hours a year ago. And here you see a demo of this person who didn't [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2124.72s)]
*  know how to code not too long ago, putting it together and creating this product that would [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2131.52s)]
*  have been such a profound startup. Imagine if you went to VCs 18 months ago and are like, look, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2135.36s)]
*  I've got this thing and I hold stuff up in front of it. It tells me all about it and it talks to me [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2140.24s)]
*  and I literally use my voice to talk to it. And he basically strung together a text to speech, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2144.08s)]
*  chat GPT, an object recognition tool, all of this stuff completely open source and a plugin that [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2150.0s)]
*  does web browsing. And the whole thing is basically like your own interactive visual robot. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2155.84s)]
*  It's an incredible product demo. And I thought it was so amazing and profound. I sure it's a [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2161.92s)]
*  prototype and it's kind of janky, but it was done in a few hours on almost a no code basis. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2166.08s)]
*  It's incredible. So what's going to come from that is a whole set of new products and ideas [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2171.52s)]
*  and things that we are certainly not thinking about today, but in six months is going to become [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2177.6000000000004s)]
*  almost mainstay and many new categories of products, many new industries, many new [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2182.08s)]
*  businesses are going to emerge that we're not even thinking about. So the lead-eyed argument of, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2186.96s)]
*  oh, this is going to destroy jobs and destroy the economy and drop costs by 90%. Lawyers are going [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2191.36s)]
*  to get cheaper, et cetera, et cetera. I think that doesn't even matter. It's the tip of the iceberg. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2195.7599999999998s)]
*  What's more exciting is all the new evolutionary stuff that's going to hit the market. That's [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2199.7599999999998s)]
*  really going to transform the things that we can do and that we didn't realize we could do. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2203.68s)]
*  There's an incredible analogy for this because what you're really talking about is more people [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2208.72s)]
*  being able to use tools and be creators. And what happened in the eighties and nineties, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2213.36s)]
*  when the NBA started playing exhibition games around the world was more people around the [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2219.44s)]
*  world started playing basketball. And then you started seeing people like Luca or before him, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2225.04s)]
*  Yao Ming, Matumbo, you start to have people from around the world who had never been exposed to [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2229.7599999999998s)]
*  basketball, just incredible, incredible talents emerged because you just had more people playing [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2234.72s)]
*  with the basketball. I think you're going to have more people playing with code and building [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2241.52s)]
*  products. So you're going to have incredible amounts of creativity from people who maybe you [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2245.4399999999996s)]
*  didn't expect because they didn't go to school for coding. I'll have that opportunity. Hey, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2251.04s)]
*  I mentioned I was in FIDA and I was at a family's office and then Wilson's and Sincenese [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2257.04s)]
*  offices to law firms being the law firms in the financial district in the Embarcadero. It was an [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2265.36s)]
*  absolute ghost town. And when I say ghost town, I mean like serious ghost town, like weird, like [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2270.7200000000003s)]
*  this is still like being in some dystopian science fiction. We were the last man on earth. And then [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2276.1600000000003s)]
*  we saw in the group chat today, 350 California Street was worth $300 million for years old. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2282.8s)]
*  That's a 22 story glass and stone tower. It's a picture of it. It's going up for sale. And [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2289.36s)]
*  they believe according to the Wall Street Journal, that bids will come in at $60 million, an 80% [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2296.1600000000003s)]
*  decline. And we talked about this commercial real estate would have this moment a lot of the banks, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2302.4s)]
*  the smaller regional banks own this debt. Saks, what do you think is going to happen here? Who is [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2308.8s)]
*  the person who would buy an office tower in downtown, even at an 80% discount, knowing that [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2315.2000000000003s)]
*  you have to pay all those carrying costs. And there's so much vacant office space and it's only [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2323.52s)]
*  increasing. Right. What's your who buys this? It's called land banking. Okay, explain. So in other [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2330.4s)]
*  words, okay, what I mean is, you're right, there's 30% vacancy in San Francisco right now, maybe going [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2337.12s)]
*  up even more in the next few years as leases roll and people take less space. You may have a [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2341.7599999999998s)]
*  countervailing effect in terms of new companies moving back because of AI or expanding. So it's [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2348.88s)]
*  possible you start to see some growth in the office market in San Francisco. But the bottom line is [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2355.52s)]
*  30% plus vacancy is going to take years and years of growth in order to absorb. So you're right, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2360.48s)]
*  this building, they can slash its rent, but they still probably can't fill it. I mean, there's just [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2367.6s)]
*  no demand. So you're going to be sitting on that property for five years, 10 years before the market [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2372.0s)]
*  comes back the way that you needed to. But there's some value, right? Oh, it's going to trade way below [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2378.2400000000002s)]
*  its replacement costs. Right. If you were to build that building today, it would cost you many times [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2383.84s)]
*  what they're going to pay for it. The problem is you can't finance that purchase with debt, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2388.64s)]
*  because the building is not going to generate enough revenue. So that's what I mean by land [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2393.3599999999997s)]
*  banking, it's going to have to be an equity investor who's willing to think long term and say, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2396.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to buy this at a super distressed price. And I'm just going to sit there and hold it and [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2401.8399999999997s)]
*  wait. Carry it, like you said, bear the carrying costs until the market comes back. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2406.24s)]
*  But J Cal, I want to say something I think it's a great analogy, because public growth stocks have [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2411.2s)]
*  declined 70 plus percent, right, since the market started to decline. And we've talked a lot about [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2416.16s)]
*  the statistic that I've shared a bunch publicly on how 70% of publicly traded companies that have [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2423.7599999999998s)]
*  gone public since 2020 are trading below their total cash invested since since founding, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2429.8399999999997s)]
*  which should translate to an estimate that call it somewhere in the order of 70% of private companies [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2435.52s)]
*  are probably worth less than their preference stack. And so they're not worthless companies, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2440.16s)]
*  they just have a capital structure that is upside down, those companies are making [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2444.96s)]
*  products for customers, those products, those customers are paying money for those products, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2449.36s)]
*  there's value there, there's real value there, the value has just been reset. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2452.8s)]
*  And so it's interesting, it's not just the asset class of growth stocks and the asset class of [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2456.64s)]
*  private companies or private tech. It's also, you know, in commercial real estate, we we try [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2461.12s)]
*  and treat each of these as if they were in isolation. But the problem is many of these assets [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2466.16s)]
*  were funded with some degree of leverage, preferred stock is leverage. And, you know, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2472.16s)]
*  it is a form of debt, because it has a preference over the shareholders, the common shareholders, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2479.52s)]
*  the equity holders. And the same is true with this commercial real estate market that there was a [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2483.3599999999997s)]
*  certain amount of debt. So the availability of low cost capital, securitized against some asset in [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2488.08s)]
*  the form of debt or in the form of preferred stock in a private company has the same effect, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2493.68s)]
*  which it allowed the valuations to balloon on the equity. And now that the market has [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2497.92s)]
*  re rationalized the prices down 70 plus percent across all three of these connected but you know, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2502.7200000000003s)]
*  somewhat disparate asset classes, you're kind of having this big reset moment. And funny enough, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2508.0s)]
*  the other statistic is the cell phone traffic down 70% and downtown SF, right? So it's funny, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2512.4s)]
*  all four of these numbers are pretty much on track. Yeah, this chart is crazy. It's literally like, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2517.6800000000003s)]
*  you have some cities that have more cell phone traffic than they did last year, or a couple [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2523.8399999999997s)]
*  years ago. And this is downtown, by the way, not the whole city. Yeah. And Sam, I mean, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2529.3599999999997s)]
*  the wider Bay Area is is I don't say booming, but it's vibrant. Yeah, I said on last week's [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2533.7599999999998s)]
*  show, I was looking for a place to host the accelerator in San Mateo area, I got dozens [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2539.2799999999997s)]
*  of people contacting me, hundreds of locations, and offers at 25% of what they're carrying [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2544.72s)]
*  cost is or like that, not the carrying cost, the rent was, and people offering me major companies [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2552.8s)]
*  offering me free space, just because they would like to have founders hanging around. And there [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2558.6400000000003s)]
*  was one project that I was like, I'll give it to you for whatever, just because I want to get more [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2563.1200000000003s)]
*  people to downtown San Mateo. So that does sort of prove the point that there is a what I saw [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2567.84s)]
*  this in New York City during the 90s. When things were so cheap, people just got creative with space [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2575.36s)]
*  it inspired people to say I'm going to create an art gallery, I'm going to create a performance [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2581.04s)]
*  space. And I don't know when that happens in San Francisco with these spaces, but [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2584.96s)]
*  feels like it's going to be a while. I don't know what you when do you think there would be demand [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2589.92s)]
*  for this space sex? If you had to pick a year over and give us an over under? I mean, five years plus, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2595.36s)]
*  I mean, just to give you some numbers, I think a healthy vacancy rate office market is five to 10% [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2603.52s)]
*  a high vacancy rate in a city was considered like 15%. Like you wouldn't want to be an office [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2610.32s)]
*  investor in a market that have 15% vacancy five to 10% was sort of the normal range. If you're under [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2617.28s)]
*  5%, it was a super hot market. And then 10 to 15 was sort of a not great market from an investor [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2622.56s)]
*  standpoint. So there are 30% plus. And like I said, it could get worse before it gets better, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2628.48s)]
*  because as Lisa's role, people are going to shed more space that they might not already be [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2634.8s)]
*  subleasing. So the real number might be like 40%. So I don't know. Yeah, it doesn't seem like a [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2639.12s)]
*  decade. That's a decade assuming that San Francisco gets his house in order, and companies come back, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2647.68s)]
*  speaking of that new companies are created. And they don't completely wreck it. It's not clear [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2654.48s)]
*  to me that like things will go in the right direction. I mean, speaking of that, do we want [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2658.64s)]
*  to bring up this horrific bear spray attack now? You want to cue that up? Sox? I mean, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2662.88s)]
*  we're like in full on Gotham City now. Now we have vigilantes. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2669.52s)]
*  There was a story of a fire commissioner named Don Carmignani, who was beaten with a metal pipe by [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2673.8399999999997s)]
*  a gang of homeless addicts who were encamped in front of his mother's house. And apparently, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2680.88s)]
*  they were harassing her and they were doing drugs, smoking drugs or whatever right in front of not [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2686.72s)]
*  pot. It was like, fentanyl, whatever fentanyl or meth, meth or crack, something like a hard drug. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2692.4s)]
*  And so what we know is he went down there, had words with them, bada beep, bada boop, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2698.48s)]
*  you know, and they bashed him upside the head with a pipe. And now it turns out that he was accused [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2705.92s)]
*  by the defendant's lawyer, the one who assaulted him. So we don't really know what's true here, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2714.08s)]
*  of using bear spray on them first. So the DA dropped charges. The lawyer for the defendant [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2718.56s)]
*  in that case is saying that he apparently was the perpetrator of these bear spray attacks on [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2723.76s)]
*  homeless people going back a number of years, I guess there's a, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2731.1200000000003s)]
*  like you said, pretty gnarly video of that. But obviously, the DA thought something was kind of [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2734.32s)]
*  hinky because they dropped charges against the guy who assaulted him. Shouldn't the person who [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2743.6000000000004s)]
*  sprays the bear spray and the person who beat somebody with a pipe shouldn't both people? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2748.88s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Listen, there's video of somebody bear spraying homeless people. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2753.2799999999997s)]
*  That's clearly wrong. However, that was from a couple of years ago. The one that was released [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2759.04s)]
*  is from 2021. We have video from the night that carbon Yanni was assaulted that they were chasing [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2762.72s)]
*  him down. They're chasing him down. Yes. With the metal pipe. And even if, even if they were acting [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2771.4399999999996s)]
*  in self-defense, you can't go chasing the guy to that's not self-defense more damage on it. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2776.48s)]
*  Exactly. That's vengeance. That's not self-defense. So they took it out of that zone of self-defense [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2780.88s)]
*  and they were chasing after him. And if you saw what he looked like after the attack, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2786.48s)]
*  they were using deadly force. He could have been killed. And if Donna had gotten killed by the [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2791.28s)]
*  metal pipe, I don't think it'd be a defense that he bear sprayed them first. No, it would have been [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2797.04s)]
*  an excessive use of force. So, but in any event, I mean, where the DA ended up on this, it was just a [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2802.8s)]
*  drop charges from that night. But you're right. They're going to drop those charges. I think that [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2807.84s)]
*  that's going to be untenable. They already dropped the charges. They have to, I mean, justice has to [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2813.1200000000003s)]
*  be blind. Correct. I mean, you're, you're, you're a trained lawyer here. We have to apply the law [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2818.8s)]
*  equally to the sadistic insane person who, and wait a second, they arrested the guy who hosed the [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2824.96s)]
*  person down. Didn't they arrest them as well? I remember seeing a perp walk. We talked about that [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2830.6400000000003s)]
*  on a previous show. Anyway, it's Gotham City, folks. This has gone to pure insane levels. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2834.16s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think this disproves anything. I mean, again, what they're trying to say now is [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2838.24s)]
*  that because of the actions that Don took that San Francisco is safe, and there's nothing to [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2841.6s)]
*  worry about. And these- Hattics. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2846.56s)]
*  People who are encamped on the sidewalks doing drugs, doing hard drugs, there's nothing to worry [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2848.7999999999997s)]
*  about because somehow they were provoked by Carmagnani. And I just think I agree with you [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2852.8799999999997s)]
*  that this is part of an overall pattern of chaos and lawlessness in the city. It is like Gotham [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2858.08s)]
*  City. So, you know, it doesn't make me feel a lot better about what's happening on the streets. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2863.52s)]
*  It's nuts. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2869.28s)]
*  Chamath, you want to add something? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2870.88s)]
*  I want Freeberg to riff on lab meat. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2872.4s)]
*  Yes. Well, there was actually a story about this. I guess there's two types of lab, there's two types [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2875.84s)]
*  of mock meats. I've had the impossible burger. I've never craved an impossible burger. There's so [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2880.88s)]
*  many great burgers you can get out there. Shake Shack, Five Guys, In-N-Out. Why would I go to get [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2887.44s)]
*  this impossible burger unless I was doing it like vegan stuff? But then there was also supposed to [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2891.04s)]
*  be 3D printed meats. And this stuff seems to be taking forever. Where is this at? Because there [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2894.4s)]
*  was a story in the Wall Street Journal about how poorly this is apparently going. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2899.2799999999997s)]
*  So there's three categories of these alternative proteins to traditional animal protein. The first [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2903.2s)]
*  is these, call it alternative proteins where you use things like soy protein [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2914.0s)]
*  or pea protein. Beyond Burger is a good example. They have a pea protein based burger. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2922.16s)]
*  And so that category was kind of hot for a minute where everyone was like, oh, it's an [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2926.7200000000003s)]
*  eco-conscious decision. People will make the shift. And, you know, Beyond Meat had this massive IPO [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2932.56s)]
*  and the stock went crazy. And someone said it was the biggest return ever for Kleiner Perkins. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2938.16s)]
*  But it really was just taking plant protein, processing it and trying to make it sort of [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2942.08s)]
*  mimic the texture and flavor and taste of animal protein. And it's more expensive. So I've generally [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2946.4s)]
*  been fairly negative on whether that really moves the needle, right? The needle for me is can you [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2952.56s)]
*  replace animal proteins traditionally and stop using all this land and putting all this carbon [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2957.2799999999997s)]
*  into the atmosphere and all this water and all these resources that we use to make all these [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2962.56s)]
*  animal proteins, which I think is both kind of ethically incorrect, but also extraordinarily [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2965.92s)]
*  environmentally costly. Sorry, can I ask a question? Qualifying question. Do you think [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2970.32s)]
*  it's also important for it to not just replace natural products despite all of those externalities [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2973.6000000000004s)]
*  you talked about with artificial products with chemicals and sugar? So first of all, everything [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2980.7200000000003s)]
*  is a chemical. So I think the categorization of all chemicals are bad is silly because everything [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2985.84s)]
*  is made of chemicals. I think it's a question of are there bad things that are being put in there [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2993.36s)]
*  that's not good for your health to make it flavorful or whatever. And that may or may not [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=2997.6s)]
*  be the case. It's really product dependent. I don't think it's a good generalization. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3002.0s)]
*  But do you so you think when I eat a salad, I'm just eating chemicals? [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3005.6s)]
*  It is chemicals. Yeah. Got it. But healthy ones, right? Healthy chemicals are in the salad. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3009.2799999999997s)]
*  There's good and there are bad. Yeah, for sure. And then bad chemicals are in like sugary cereal. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3014.56s)]
*  Yeah, like refined sugar is bad for sure. Right. That's a bad chemical. And I'm just I just want [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3019.04s)]
*  to understand you just view it as a spectrum of chemicals, some good, some bad. Yeah, there's [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3023.44s)]
*  things that are good for you. There's good fats, there's bad fat. There's there's, you know, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3027.52s)]
*  and even in the category of sugar, some people say all sugars are bad. Some people say some sugars [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3031.44s)]
*  are better than worse others, as measured by the glycemic index. You know, there's a lot of ways [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3035.44s)]
*  to kind of look at this stuff is beyond meat and these P ones. They're all processed, highly [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3039.7599999999998s)]
*  processed. They got a lot of salt, they got a lot of fat, right? They're not good for you. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3044.88s)]
*  So the way that beyond and impossible and others have tried to make it taste good for people is [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3049.6s)]
*  they've added a lot of you know, saturated fats, which is a way to drive the mouth feel and make it [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3054.64s)]
*  taste good. But then a lot of doctors, the American Heart Association came out and said that those fats [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3059.52s)]
*  are really bad for your heart and you shouldn't eat them. And also, there's been a general kind [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3064.96s)]
*  of consumer sentiment shift. So a couple years ago, these were the hottest products, it was like all [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3069.3599999999997s)]
*  the food ingredient companies were shifting to plant based proteins. And they were building plant [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3074.8799999999997s)]
*  based protein business categories. And it was this big hot thing. And then they came out and [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3079.12s)]
*  they're like, wait a second, this isn't going as we thought. What happens is people try them out. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3083.2s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, that's a cool thing. I want to do good for the planet. But would I rather [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3087.8399999999997s)]
*  pay five bucks for a do good for the planet burger that kind of doesn't taste that good? Or would I [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3091.52s)]
*  rather pay three bucks for a burger that tastes really good? And what happens is the B, B, I choose [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3096.48s)]
*  option B. Yeah. And so to most people, right? And so almost all people and I've that's a point I've [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3102.16s)]
*  viewed, I've always shared, I said, it's just, it's not going to win the hearts and minds of the world [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3106.3999999999996s)]
*  unless it's cheaper and it's taste better and healthier. And it's identical. Yeah, and doesn't [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3110.0s)]
*  damage your health doesn't make you worse. Exactly. So the more challenging technical solution is the [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3114.16s)]
*  other two categories. The second category is can you synthesize animal proteins using recombinant [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3119.52s)]
*  DNA. So this is where you take the DNA that codes for the protein, whether it's the milk protein or [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3125.68s)]
*  the egg protein or the cheese protein. And you put it in a bacterial cell or a yeast cell that are [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3131.52s)]
*  used to ferment that we used to make wine that we used to make beer, and they eat sugar, and then [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3136.32s)]
*  they spit out a product. And in the case of wine and beer, they eat sugar from grapes or for from [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3141.2000000000003s)]
*  malt or whatever, and they spit out alcohol, ethanol. And Genentech was the first company [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3146.4s)]
*  to really pioneer recombinant DNA at a mass scale. They basically use recombinant DNA to make insulin. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3151.76s)]
*  So they took the DNA from humans that that codes for insulin, the gene for insulin, they put it in [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3157.6000000000004s)]
*  E. coli bacteria, and then they put the E. coli bacteria in a big tank. And the E. coli start to [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3162.4s)]
*  duplicate and they make all this insulin. And that's how we make all the world's insulin today is [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3167.2000000000003s)]
*  using that bio manufacturing process. And it's how we make all of biologic drugs, all antibody [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3170.96s)]
*  drugs are made this way. It's a $300 billion a year market just in biologic drugs. So when CRISPR kind [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3176.2400000000002s)]
*  of came about in 2012, suddenly the toolkit to go in and do a much better job and a much cheaper job [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3181.84s)]
*  of editing the genomes of little microbes to make them more efficient at making these proteins [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3188.56s)]
*  became standard. And everyone said, let's go use this new category of what's being called synthetic [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3193.44s)]
*  biology or symbio to make all these animal proteins that we use animals to get today. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3198.16s)]
*  So can I just ask a question is the idea that if you use recombinant DNA in this process, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3203.52s)]
*  it would taste better and be healthier and all this chemically identical. So it's the exact same [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3208.08s)]
*  protein as you would get. I understand. I understand the exact same under a microscope or whatever. But [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3213.04s)]
*  would it taste the same case? Exactly. Totally. Exactly. So that's the whole point. Do we know [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3218.56s)]
*  that or was that that was the guess? No, we know that it's the same protein, Chamath. So whether [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3223.36s)]
*  you get the protein from the cow, you get the protein from the yeast cell. So what's the issue [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3227.2799999999997s)]
*  is too expensive to do this process. So the key metric in that second category is productivity [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3231.68s)]
*  grams per liter per day. How well can you get that little microorganism to make that protein, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3238.72s)]
*  the more protein it makes per day, the cheaper the price per protein. And we're still a far [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3244.0s)]
*  ways off from getting this to be price competitive. So that's a challenge category right now. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3248.56s)]
*  There's a lot of I'm invested in a couple of companies in this space, where we're trying [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3253.68s)]
*  to make it faster and cheaper to do that strain engineering to edit the genome up front and make [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3257.36s)]
*  them make those little cells more productive to bring the price per gram down, and hopefully make [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3261.76s)]
*  it compete ultimately, with the traditional market for eggs, cheese, milk, etc. But what is the [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3265.92s)]
*  constraint? Is it an energy constraint? Or is it natural biological incapability? [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3270.56s)]
*  No. So the great thing is, on a first principles basis, the biophysics indicates that this should [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3274.88s)]
*  make proteins cheaper. And that is good for the planet. It's good for human health. It's good for [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3279.84s)]
*  everything. We should be able to make eggs, cheese, milk, all this stuff exactly the same as what you [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3284.48s)]
*  get from an animal without the animal. Because the biophysics of a single cell making it is better [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3288.96s)]
*  than the biophysics of a whole animal. Think about a chicken, it grows feathers, it clucks, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3293.68s)]
*  it walks around, it has energy, it makes heat. So the chicken as a system is not that energy [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3298.16s)]
*  efficient. But a little cell that just eats sugar, and it's programmed to do one thing and one thing [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3302.64s)]
*  only. Each sugar make protein, each sugar make protein and spit as much of it out, you theoretically [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3307.2s)]
*  can make it way more efficient. Exactly. Now, we're making great progress, but we're not there yet. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3311.8399999999997s)]
*  We're not at commodity price points. Why I'm trying to ask why where's the failure point? [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3316.56s)]
*  There's two failure points. Sorry, I should I should say there's three. The first is strain [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3320.72s)]
*  engineering, which is you want to shuffle all the other genes in the organism to stop doing things [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3324.64s)]
*  like growing a bigger cell wall, or, you know, taking your time to duplicate, you want to change [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3329.2799999999997s)]
*  the genome of the cell to get it to do stuff faster. The second stage is process engineering. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3334.4s)]
*  When you put that cell in a tank, you're changing the sugar, the methanol, the co2, the oxygen, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3339.12s)]
*  the pH, everything about that tank and the condition of the tank has to be adjusted. So [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3344.7999999999997s)]
*  there's about 60 variables. And those 60 variables all need to be tuned and tweaked before you optimize [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3348.64s)]
*  the performance of production. The third category is the hardest, which is scale manufacturing. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3353.84s)]
*  There's about 100 million liters of bio manufacturing capacity on Earth today. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3359.28s)]
*  95 million liters is owned and operated by companies that use and when I say bio [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3364.48s)]
*  manufacturing capacity, I'm talking about big stainless steel tanks, you pour water, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3368.6400000000003s)]
*  you pour sugar, you pour your cells in, they make copies and they make your stuff. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3372.7200000000003s)]
*  Of that 100 million liters, 95 million is owned and operated by companies. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3376.8s)]
*  5 million is available for rent. Of that 5 million liters, 4 million is rented for its entire lifespan [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3380.96s)]
*  by some company, usually a biologic drug company, because very little of this is being done in food [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3386.64s)]
*  today. So there's only a million liters left to rent. And there's 200 syn-bio startups trying to [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3390.64s)]
*  make animal proteins. And they've all competed for this capacity. So the capacity cost has gone up by [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3395.36s)]
*  about fourfold. But it sounds like the latter two, you can overcome with capital, but the first one [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3400.48s)]
*  is really bounded by science. It's more engineering because what you track is kind of what's called the [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3406.8s)]
*  tighter curve, which is grams per liter. And the more experiments you do, the higher that number [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3411.6000000000004s)]
*  goes. And so if you can increase your experimental rate- And the few grams that it does produce today, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3415.52s)]
*  when a normal person tastes it, they're like, yep, this tastes the same as a Wagyu ribeye? [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3421.84s)]
*  No. So remember, I'm talking about proteins right now. I'm not talking about cellular meat. I want [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3428.5600000000004s)]
*  to talk about cellular meat last, which is the hardest category, which is what you're talking [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3432.88s)]
*  about. I'm talking about taking that protein and then using it to make a product like a cheese, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3437.12s)]
*  or using it as an egg replacer, that kind of stuff. It's the same protein as what you would get from [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3442.2400000000002s)]
*  eggs or milk or what have you. This all just sounds so hard. Well, it's a big problem. And it's a lot [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3445.92s)]
*  of money. So is it a problem? Eggs alone are $200 billion a year. I mean, the methane released from [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3450.6400000000003s)]
*  cows is one of the largest contributors to global warming. It's a real problem. Also, we're going to [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3456.56s)]
*  need to solve this, Jamath. If we're going to colonize Uranus, we're going to need to get food [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3461.84s)]
*  there. I just asked a question. If you go after the high emission categories first, do you give [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3467.52s)]
*  yourself room to leave these things because you're doing so much already? Just a question. Animal [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3472.7200000000003s)]
*  agriculture emissions are one of the largest and unfortunately, one of the biggest drivers, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3478.96s)]
*  because as people's GDP per capita increments, the first thing they spend money on is protein. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3484.32s)]
*  I get it. I'm saying something different, which is if we just invented better heat pumps, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3488.72s)]
*  you'd have industrial heating and cooling, which represents almost a third of all [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3492.32s)]
*  greenhouse gas emissions. You get that off and you give yourself a lot of time and space and room. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3496.24s)]
*  And maybe you let the cows roam and belch and burp because the meat just tastes better and [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3501.68s)]
*  you don't have to spend a bunch of time and effort. I don't think it's an ore. I think it's an [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3506.72s)]
*  Anshamath. I think we should be doing all these things. And I think that I'm a big believer, [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3509.52s)]
*  as you guys know, in markets. So I'm not a believer in transition for the sake of [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3514.56s)]
*  carbon saving because people aren't going to pay a premium as we've seen with the kind of [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3520.24s)]
*  alternative meat market. $15 subpar hamburgers are not working. People want cheaper. Markets [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3524.16s)]
*  want cheaper, cheaper, cheaper. So if you can make protein cheaper, it's also a great ROI. You can [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3528.4s)]
*  make money doing this and the market will buy it because it's cheaper protein. I just want to hit [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3532.88s)]
*  on this because we keep the sidetracking a little bit. The third category is the one that the article [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3539.52s)]
*  was about, which is cellular meat. So cellular meat is where you're trying to make your wagyu [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3542.88s)]
*  or your shrimp or your fish. You're trying to make cells, not just proteins, but entire cells. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3547.12s)]
*  And those cells stick together and they look and cook and feel and taste like cellular meat, [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3552.32s)]
*  like muscle, like what you eat when you eat fish or beef or whatever. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3557.6800000000003s)]
*  And the problem there is you're trying to take a cell and cells normally grow on, you know, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3562.56s)]
*  bones and on tissue. And so there's scaffolding and all these systems that hold all the cells [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3568.1600000000003s)]
*  together. And so to get cells to grow in a tank and stick together and replicate without other [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3572.48s)]
*  cells signaling them turns out to be really expensive. There was an executive at Merck I [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3578.2400000000002s)]
*  spoke to a few months ago and he said, we're going to sell fetal bovine serum, which is basically [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3582.16s)]
*  like this liquid that they get from the fetuses of cows. And this is how cellular meat started. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3587.36s)]
*  They took a cell from a cow and they put it in a tank with fetal bovine serum and the cell started [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3592.88s)]
*  to replicate and duplicate. And then they could take those cells and try and turn them into a beef, [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3597.36s)]
*  into a burger and sell it or try it. That was the million dollar burger. If you remember that a [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3601.36s)]
*  couple of years ago and fetal bovine serum market has gone through the roof because so many companies [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3605.52s)]
*  are trying to make cellular meat. And the Merck exec was like, we're going to sell a billion [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3609.92s)]
*  dollars of fetal bovine serum, and then we're going to sell zero because no one's going to be [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3613.6000000000004s)]
*  able to make money doing this. It's just impossible. You're not going to sell $500 burgers. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3616.7200000000003s)]
*  So the technical challenge there is you have to edit the cells to get them to duplicate. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3620.8s)]
*  You have to get them to grow in suspension, meaning in a tank instead of growing on bones [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3624.96s)]
*  and growing next to each other and scaffolding. And then you have to change the feedstock so that [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3629.2s)]
*  you're creating all these other proteins and signaling factors and hormones that you pour [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3633.4399999999996s)]
*  into the tank that trigger those cells to grow. Is there any chance that after all this, it's, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3637.8399999999997s)]
*  it actually just tastes slightly different or better? It may. Yeah, it may, but likely not. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3641.68s)]
*  I mean, let's be honest. These are, you're taking a cow cell or a salmon cell. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3647.3599999999997s)]
*  No, the reason I say this is that I don't know if you, I mean, you don't eat meat. So maybe you [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3651.7599999999998s)]
*  don't know this, but depending on where the water that they drink, the actual grass that they eat, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3655.36s)]
*  the meat does taste different. And that's part of the, the cows massage. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3662.4s)]
*  I mean, look at the eight corn fed cows that we used to have at poker [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3668.96s)]
*  before austerity measures. Life was so good in 2021. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3673.44s)]
*  Well, that's that. No, we can't get it anymore. Yeah, I know we're on a budget. I get it. No, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3676.96s)]
*  not us. We can't get it anymore because they sell it through one channel. But yeah, like, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3682.08s)]
*  that tastes so good. Yeah, the variation you're talking about is obviously at an [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3686.72s)]
*  echelon and a class of eating chamath, it's probably not mainstay. Like, you know, the [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3691.2s)]
*  $30,000 a year McDonald's burger and chicken nugget eater is probably happy to take a burger. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3695.6s)]
*  No, I disagree with you. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3700.4s)]
*  Chicken nugget that tastes like that. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3701.44s)]
*  I disagree with you because if you go into Whole Foods and you actually buy like a USDA top sirloin, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3702.4s)]
*  there's a certain taste that it has that things that are not USDA don't have. So even even at [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3707.28s)]
*  like the most basic layer of the food pyramid, you can differentiate on taste based on the same. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3713.84s)]
*  This is why I'm saying I think it's just a very complicated, long drawn out process. And I just [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3719.52s)]
*  wonder if the people that are in these businesses, if they actually love food or not, I understand [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3724.32s)]
*  why they love the science, I get it. And why they would love to save the planet. I get that too. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3729.6000000000004s)]
*  But unless some of these people are are also food lovers, they're going to miss I think the thing [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3734.3999999999996s)]
*  where it all dies anyway. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3739.44s)]
*  I just want to restate again, for the final time, these are these are identical cells and [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3740.48s)]
*  identical proteins to what you're getting from the animal. So they are not like what we talked [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3746.7999999999997s)]
*  about in that first category, where you're trying to get other stuff to sort of taste like meat, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3751.04s)]
*  you're literally trying to create the meat and create the protein using these systems. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3755.44s)]
*  And I'm just trying to tell you that salmon, two pieces of salmon can taste totally different [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3760.96s)]
*  depending on where it's swam. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3765.52s)]
*  Right. And I guess what I could say is, yeah, you could probably adjust the conditions in the [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3766.96s)]
*  tank if needed to change the characteristic. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3771.52s)]
*  This is my point, like you don't even know where to start. How is it the fucking kelp in the [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3774.72s)]
*  Atlantic Ocean? Like, what are you changing? [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3778.16s)]
*  Look, I don't know what kelp effects on the salmon. I don't know if salmon. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3780.8s)]
*  But this is my point. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3784.64s)]
*  Nobody does. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3785.52s)]
*  Atlantic Ocean. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3786.16s)]
*  This is why we pay so much for the acorn fed beef. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3787.12s)]
*  I get it. But most beef is not kelp from the Atlantic Ocean fed salmon. It's animals grown [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3789.76s)]
*  in very large feedlots fed corn and water. That's it. Let me just say that again. 90%, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3795.76s)]
*  95% of animal protein consumed is cows, pigs and chickens grown in feedlots, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3800.1600000000003s)]
*  fed corn and soybeans and water. And that's it. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3806.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. But if you go to different countries and taste the meat that's fed in that exact same way, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3809.0400000000004s)]
*  it tastes different. So for example, if you go to Argentina, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3813.76s)]
*  I appreciate what you're saying. But the point I'm going to make is you can recreate whatever [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3817.6s)]
*  the system is that you're talking about. So I want to just get back to the unit economics. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3821.68s)]
*  The cost per kilogram or the cost per gram of the protein, we are still many orders of magnitude [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3825.2799999999997s)]
*  away on cellular meat. So the problems you're laying out are really down the road problems [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3830.48s)]
*  of optimization. Right now we've got more fundamental problems on how do you actually [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3834.8799999999997s)]
*  get this stuff to be cost competitive. Now, fortunately, the tools of CRISPR and since [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3838.48s)]
*  CRISPR Cas9 came out 10 years ago, there are now hundreds of variants that are open source, [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3842.32s)]
*  IP free, royalty free, and used very broadly and generally and DNA sequencing costs continue [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3847.1200000000003s)]
*  to decline. Those are the two basic tools that are being used by biochemists and engineers to do [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3851.84s)]
*  rapid evolutionary iteration needed to produce the recombinant production of proteins to produce the [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3858.0800000000004s)]
*  new cells to produce the feedstock for those tanks. And there's a cost curve that we're trying to get [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3863.76s)]
*  over. It's not happening overnight. Hundreds of millions of dollars and in several cases, [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3868.32s)]
*  billions of dollars have gone into these systems. And it's very likely that these companies may need [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3872.88s)]
*  several more years and several billion dollars. We are going to get there. The technology is [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3877.44s)]
*  progressing. The rate of progress is a little slower and it's a little more challenged, I think, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3881.76s)]
*  than the first round of investors had hoped. But I do think that scientifically and first principles, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3886.48s)]
*  it is absolutely feasible. It's a function of engineering our way there to giving Chamath and [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3892.2400000000002s)]
*  everyone else that eats burgers and chicken nuggets everything that they want, hopefully at [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3897.28s)]
*  a lower price. If you put it on the curve of self driving cars, you know, we have crews doing some [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3900.7200000000003s)]
*  automated taxis in like a very constrained area in San Francisco, but we don't have it everywhere. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3906.1600000000003s)]
*  Where do you put this on the curve? It's a great question. So what's happened, by the way, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3911.44s)]
*  as we've gotten down the cost curve, we are unlocking new markets. So new products are being [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3915.28s)]
*  produced existing proteins that are come from animals. There's a good example of a product [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3921.28s)]
*  called pepsin. It's extracted from pigs today. It's very expensive, similar to how we used to [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3925.28s)]
*  make insulin. And we're replacing the sourcing of that product. We replaced insulin, which we used [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3930.5600000000004s)]
*  to get from pig spleens. We now make it recombinantly. We're now replacing pepsin. We're replacing the [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3935.6800000000003s)]
*  rennet that's used to make cheese. So as we move down the cost curve, these high, what are called [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3941.92s)]
*  high value proteins are the first to fall. Those markets collapse because we now make them recombinantly. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3946.48s)]
*  Sorry, they collapse in price because they're now cheaper using recombinant systems instead of taking [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3952.0s)]
*  them from animals. And eventually we'll get to that cost curve where they're ubiquitous for all [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3956.32s)]
*  proteins or for all types of cells. In the meantime, there are pretty sizable markets to go after. These [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3960.24s)]
*  are multi-billion dollar markets that are getting knocked down. We don't talk about it every day. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3964.88s)]
*  It doesn't show up in the news, but it's really profound and interesting to see that this technology [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3969.04s)]
*  is working. It's overturning multi-billion dollar markets. It's making progress. And hopefully it'll [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3974.08s)]
*  get to the point that everything from the chicken nugget to the kelp fed salmon can. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3980.08s)]
*  Have you guys tried a Beyond Burger or an Impossible Burger? [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3985.84s)]
*  I've had it. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3989.12s)]
*  I've tried them a long time ago, but I've not tried them recently. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3989.84s)]
*  They're like, it's like eating something mushy that's 60% of an average hamburger. It's not [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=3993.04s)]
*  worth paying double for certainly for somebody who's a hamburger eater. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4000.32s)]
*  So while we were talking, by the way, Amazon's results came out. They crushed it earnings per [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4004.8s)]
*  share of 31 cents versus 11. And stocks up 10% off hours and it was up 4% today. Where are the [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4010.88s)]
*  insider traders who are making bets? [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4021.36s)]
*  How do you feel about your recession prediction? [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4022.8s)]
*  I'm sticking by it. I think we're still going to have a recession, but it is an interesting [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4026.08s)]
*  paradox here. So I think there's only a couple of possibilities. Either tech is sort of immune [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4029.92s)]
*  or they forecast down so much. They were so conservative in their forecast thinking [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4038.48s)]
*  we're going to be in a recession that it was easy to beat. Or look, I could be wrong about [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4043.44s)]
*  the recession, but Powell is saying it. And Powell is saying if it's not a recession, [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4048.0800000000004s)]
*  it's going to be less than 1% growth. It's going to be a rounding error to recession. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4052.6400000000003s)]
*  He's not credible. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4055.84s)]
*  So I'm not revising my forecast. Well, I think Powell is credible when he's giving us bad news [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4057.6s)]
*  because their incentive is always to fluff it up and make it sound better than it is. So when [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4063.28s)]
*  he's telling you things look bad, maybe they're looking really bad. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4067.36s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4072.32s)]
*  But look, it's a tale of two cities right now. I mean, the big tech companies seem to be doing [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4073.76s)]
*  really well. So it's definitely a paradox. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4076.96s)]
*  Yeah. All right, everybody. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4081.2s)]
*  Well, the whole RFK thing. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4082.64s)]
*  Okay. That's a good topic. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4084.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, great topic. Go ahead. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4086.16s)]
*  I think we should tell people like what he's about. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4087.12s)]
*  Where are all yours? [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4090.0s)]
*  I think he gave a terrific announcement speech. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4090.8799999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4093.44s)]
*  And just to give you some background for the younger viewers who may not know. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4093.8399999999997s)]
*  So Robert F. Kennedy, his father, ran for the Democratic nomination in 1968 after his brother, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4098.0s)]
*  John F. Kennedy, had been president, assassinated as we know, in the early 1960s. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4103.5199999999995s)]
*  What happened is at this time, before the 1968 election, Lyndon B. Johnson was the [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4109.2s)]
*  incumbent Democratic president. And everyone thought that he'd be the party's nominee and [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4114.08s)]
*  he was going to get reelected. And he was brought down by an extremely unpopular war, the Vietnam War. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4118.8s)]
*  And it was RFK Jr.'s father, who was a great critic of the Vietnam War. And he ran [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4123.76s)]
*  for the Democratic nomination. And I think that he very likely would have gotten it on the night [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4129.6s)]
*  that he won the California primary, he was assassinated. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4133.92s)]
*  By Sir Hans Sirhan, right? [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4136.72s)]
*  Yeah. If you go back and look at the things that he was saying in that campaign, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4138.8s)]
*  he really was saying a lot of beautiful things that are in his son's ad that I think would be [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4143.52s)]
*  worth playing here. But I think you have maybe the setup for a similar situation here. You've got an [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4149.040000000001s)]
*  incumbent Democratic president who is sort of not that popular. He's sort of old and out of it and [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4154.160000000001s)]
*  incoherent. He's presiding over a war that is rapidly becoming a debacle. You don't hear so [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4160.160000000001s)]
*  much about the spring counteroffensive anymore. These new Pentagon papers that were leaked show [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4165.68s)]
*  that the Ukrainian casualties are at least five times greater than they've been publicly admitting. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4170.88s)]
*  It looks like Russia is certainly not losing the way they used to be. They've captured 90% of [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4175.84s)]
*  Bakhmat, which has been the most violent, bloody battle of the war. And Biden at this point has [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4180.72s)]
*  no strategy to bring that to an end. In fact, he's rejected multiple attempts at a peace deal. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4185.28s)]
*  And so now it looks like it's the Chinese who are in the driver's seat, potentially putting [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4192.0s)]
*  together some sort of diplomatic settlement. So I think, listen, if the economy ends up going [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4196.48s)]
*  into recession and this war ends up becoming the fiasco that it's increasingly looking like, [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4201.12s)]
*  you could have a setup like 1968, where people are wondering why the hell is this guy our nominee? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4205.599999999999s)]
*  And let me tell you, RFK Junior's already pulling at 19%, which I think is pretty good, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4211.12s)]
*  considering he just came out of the gate and people don't even know the substance of his campaign yet. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4216.08s)]
*  Marianne Williamson's at 9%. So if she dropped out, you'd be at 28% [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4220.8s)]
*  for the alternative. And I think he could go up from here. And I think if you watch the speech [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4225.68s)]
*  he gave, I thought there was a lot of really beautiful sentiments in there. He said that Biden [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4230.64s)]
*  has made Ukraine a pawn in a geopolitical battle that has put the flower of Ukraine's youth into an [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4237.12s)]
*  abattoir of death in order to exhaust Russia. He channeled America's anti-war traditions. He [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4242.64s)]
*  quoted John Quincy Adams that America should not go abroad in search of monsters to destroy. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4248.72s)]
*  He quoted Martin Luther King Jr. There is a direct link between poverty and violence and oppression [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4253.52s)]
*  at home and war abroad. He talked about the role of the CIA during his uncle's administration, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4258.8s)]
*  where he said that John F. Kennedy eventually realized that the purpose the CIA had become [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4266.72s)]
*  to create a steady pipeline of wars to feed the military industrial complex. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4273.68s)]
*  And he talks about how JFK came to distrust the CIA and realized that it was lying to him. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4277.92s)]
*  And the biggest applause line of his speech was when he quoted JFK approvingly saying that he [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4284.56s)]
*  wanted to take the CIA and shatter it into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4289.52s)]
*  And this very same week that he gave the speech, we found out that five former [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4294.4800000000005s)]
*  CIA directors had participated in a giant hoax on the American people by claiming that this Hunter [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4298.88s)]
*  Biden story was Russian disinformation. They knew it was not. They knew it was not. The information [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4304.56s)]
*  on the hard drive was real. It showed that Hunter Biden received multi-million dollar payments [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4310.4800000000005s)]
*  from foreign governments, including China and Ukraine. And regardless of what you think of that [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4315.68s)]
*  story, it should not have been suppressed by social media and it certainly should not have been [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4322.56s)]
*  suppressed in a PSYOP by 51 former intelligence officials, including five former directors of the [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4326.48s)]
*  CIA. And if that's the way they're going to behave, if they're going to meddle in American politics that [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4334.32s)]
*  way, I think we do need to start over. We do need to ask what's going on with the security state. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4338.08s)]
*  They're not supposed to be meddling in American politics that way. So I think if this is the way [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4342.0s)]
*  they're going to act, I say shatter away, scatter that thing into a thousand pieces. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4347.12s)]
*  Hey, it's Catholic. I'll vote for him. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4351.679999999999s)]
*  And he's called out the insanity of COVID lockdowns and mandates. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4353.36s)]
*  I mean, that's the thing that he's, I guess that's the big controversy is he's anti, [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4359.5199999999995s)]
*  he's an anti-vaxxer. I guess that's the one thing they're trying to position him as. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4363.599999999999s)]
*  And he does a little bit of conspiracy theory stuff. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4367.5199999999995s)]
*  Perfect. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4370.24s)]
*  So listen, if you go back and look at his record, he was an environmental activist for most of his [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4371.28s)]
*  career. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4375.36s)]
*  Big time. He did the watershed project in New York where they basically bought the land along the [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4375.86s)]
*  Hudson. I remember I've had some events for it. They wanted to clean the Hudson up and they just [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4379.44s)]
*  bought the land and then people donated the land and they bought it. They raised money. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4384.4s)]
*  And the Hudson today has like, you know, it's flourishing amazingly. And he's directly [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4388.5599999999995s)]
*  responsible for that. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4395.36s)]
*  He was a big critic of the way that corporate greed could lead certain big companies to engage [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4396.16s)]
*  in environmental pollution. And at a certain point he realized that big pharma had a similar [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4400.4s)]
*  incentive. Now, I don't know if he was right about those vaccines, but I do know that he's [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4404.879999999999s)]
*  right in the case of COVID. They had an incentive to push this dubious mRNA shot on us so that we [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4408.64s)]
*  get boosted a zillion times. And he's right about that. He was right about the fact that this should [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4415.6s)]
*  never have been mandated. We shouldn't have the lockdowns. And you know what? In his nomination [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4420.0s)]
*  speech or his declaration, the word vaccine was only mentioned once. So this is not what his [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4424.400000000001s)]
*  campaign is about. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4429.12s)]
*  And I look forward to having him on. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4430.08s)]
*  Yeah. And to be honest, I mean, look at all the other things that were deemed to be conspiracy [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4433.12s)]
*  theories that ended up being true. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4436.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4438.400000000001s)]
*  Lost last monster. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4439.04s)]
*  Not that. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4441.76s)]
*  It could go either way. It could be a Pulitzer or it could be embarrassing. Let me ask you this, [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4442.56s)]
*  Sax, if it was him versus Trump, who do you vote for? [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4446.64s)]
*  Well, I'm going to reserve. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4449.84s)]
*  R.F.K. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4450.96s)]
*  100%. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4451.76s)]
*  R.F.K. versus Trump, Sax. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4452.24s)]
*  I'm not going to take a position on the general yet, but in the Democratic primary, I'm definitely [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4453.76s)]
*  endorsing R.F.K. Jr. in the Democratic primary. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4458.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4462.16s)]
*  You voted the Democratic primary. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4462.400000000001s)]
*  I will. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4464.400000000001s)]
*  You're a Republican. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4464.8s)]
*  What if I could? I'll do an event for him. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4465.68s)]
*  All right, everybody. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4467.84s)]
*  All right. To all the amazing people who got together for the episode 125. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4468.56s)]
*  Unbelievable. Over 40 or 50 of them. Ray, great job. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4472.8s)]
*  Shout out to Ray. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4476.4800000000005s)]

*  Oh, that's great. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4482.0s)]
*  Europe and I don't know, all over the place. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4482.56s)]
*  No one got robbed or mugged or bear spray. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4484.96s)]
*  Hopefully. I don't know if they did any in San Francisco. There's no bear spray in [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4486.96s)]
*  San Francisco. That's good. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4489.76s)]
*  They had a big turnout. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4491.360000000001s)]
*  Not in the marina. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4492.240000000001s)]

*  And Rain Man. I am the world's greatest moderator. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4504.32s)]
*  We'll see you next time, everybody. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4507.76s)]
*  Love you, boys. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4509.28s)]

*  like this, like sexual tension, but they just need to release it out. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slYsEzJZoY&t=4546.56s)]
