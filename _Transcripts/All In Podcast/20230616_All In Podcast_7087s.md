# E133 Market melt-up, IPO update, AI startups overheat, Reddit revolts & more with Brad Gerstner
**All In Podcast:** [June 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0)
*  I'm so fucking tired. I've slept six hours in three and a half days. Six hours. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=0.0s)]
*  So wait, you went to the World Series of Poker with Hellmute. So you spent? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5.4s)]
*  No, no, no. First of all, I flew public. Took Southwest. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=10.88s)]
*  What? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=13.88s)]
*  Yeah, cost me $49. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=14.84s)]
*  You were on a Southwest flight? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=16.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got a ticket for 49 bucks. It's so fucking incredible. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=16.88s)]
*  Oh, did you sit in seat A1, also known as J Cal's reserve seat? It has my name on it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=19.76s)]
*  Well, it was in the front row. Yeah, it's great. Like Southwest has these numbers. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=24.6s)]
*  Hold on, you were in first class on Southwest? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=29.36s)]
*  No, no, no, no. Premium plus. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=32.0s)]
*  He was in the front row. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=34.08s)]
*  No, there's like these signs that have a number that attaches to your ticket. And then you stand [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=35.12s)]
*  in that line and then you go on in this orderly way. And so I had like A5 or something. So I was [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=40.08s)]
*  like the fifth person on. And then I sat in the front and I put my bags up top. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=45.92s)]
*  Yeah, you carried your bags. Yeah. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=51.36s)]
*  An hour later, I was in Vegas. It was so easy. Southwest is phenomenal. And then I flew back. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=52.8s)]
*  Anyways, and after after losing as much money as I did, it felt good to fly for $49. I got to be [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=57.6s)]
*  honest with you. Well, austerity measures have their benefits. You can sleep better at night [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=62.64s)]
*  with austerity measures. And did you go to the all you can eat buffet and take a to go as well? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=67.04s)]
*  No, I never do that. You never know. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=71.44s)]
*  Why did you fly Southwest? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=87.6s)]
*  Why did I fly Southwest? Well, the planes in Europe with Nat, that's number one. And then two, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  I just wanted some flexibility to get in and out depending on when I busted these tournaments. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=96.56s)]
*  So let me tell you about these tournaments. The 100k is literally like a murderer's row of like [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=100.56s)]
*  every great poker pro. So it was like 96 of us or something. I got to be honest with you, it was [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=107.6s)]
*  so much fun. So much fun. Why? How so? You know, we play 40 minute levels, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=115.27999999999999s)]
*  and you have to really get the chips moving, which means that there's only so much like, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  you know, game theory optimal poker you can play. And at some point, you just got to gamble it up, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=127.28s)]
*  and you got to take your shots, and you have to be willing to bluff. And, you know, you have to bet [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=131.44s)]
*  for thin equity. It's so much fun. And then you see some of these guys that just lose their minds. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=135.44s)]
*  Anyways, it was it was really, really a lot of fun. I finished in the middle of the pack, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=140.8s)]
*  like 40 seconds or something. So that was brutal. But then the thing that I'm the most proud of is [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=145.44s)]
*  and I went from that and I hopped in the 3k six six handed right afterwards. And there was like [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=149.36s)]
*  1250 people in that and I got to 81st. And whoa, the problem was like just couldn't get anything [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=155.04s)]
*  going. I couldn't get any real like you need some card distribution like you have to at some point, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=160.72s)]
*  make some hands you can't just you know, I could bluff my way to 81st, but I needed hands to really, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=166.16s)]
*  to really really have a chance to chip up and run it. Then I played in the Raz, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=171.76s)]
*  which is seven card stud low. There's 126 people now when I finished in the middle of the pack [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=177.12s)]
*  there. And then this 10k bounty, there's about 600 people and I finished like 150. Those are all [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  respectable. I mean, I know play tournaments, I have no idea how to play tournament, to be honest, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=189.04s)]
*  I know how to play poker, I know how to play cash games, but tournaments are very different. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=192.72s)]
*  So I feel like I was very ill prepared. But I had so much fun. And you know, the crazy thing is, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=195.68s)]
*  when you're playing for 12 hours a day, you are focused for 12 hours. The thing that I forgot is [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=201.92s)]
*  that you end up I ended up losing like two and a half pounds. Oh, wow. If your brain is going, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=207.52s)]
*  going going, going, biggest fucking thing. And I was, I was mentally devastated at the end of each [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=213.52s)]
*  night, you're just lying in bed, eyes awake. Yep. And then you can't sleep. And so then, you know, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=220.8s)]
*  you go and you play craps and buck rot. Break the casino for 100 times a night there and then go [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=224.72s)]
*  back to bed. It's great. Sounds like a great week. The good news is, is Phil was live blogging [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=230.16000000000003s)]
*  for you on your behalf from over your shoulder. By the way, the other thing was, I brought my phone, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=236.4s)]
*  but I don't have anything on my phone. Like I don't have Twitter. I don't have any of that stuff. So [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=242.0s)]
*  I was just totally in the zone. It felt so great to not be connected to social [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=246.24s)]
*  flow experience. It's a flow experience when you can turn everything off and just be in the moment. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=250.8s)]
*  Congratulations on the, on the, you know, coming in the 10% of the field and the 3000 or 8% of the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  field. That's incredible, dude. If I really practice at these tournaments, I think I would [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=260.24s)]
*  bank a couple, but I just don't have the time. The paradox there is that you did best in the largest [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=263.76s)]
*  field. If you can do this for three or four years and you go into those RAS fields when it's 100 or [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=267.92s)]
*  those 25 K, a hundred Ks when it's a hundred, 200 people in the hundred K there's 90, 95, 96 people. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=273.28s)]
*  Like you really do have about a 1% shot of winning the thing, which is pretty incredible. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=280.08s)]
*  RAS too. RAS is always a hundred. I love tournament poker. That was my, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=285.11999999999995s)]
*  that was my game back in the day. It's because it's because you're afraid to lose money. So it's [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  perfect for you. Put up a small amount of money and you can play for many hours. You're probably [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  in your mind, you're probably dividing the number of hours by your buy-in so that you can think [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=297.11999999999995s)]
*  about what your hourly cost is. I actually like tournament poker because when you lose, you lose. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=300.48s)]
*  Like you can't just rebuy. And then there's a broader macro strategy. You start to play the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=305.44s)]
*  chips against the other players because you know how everyone else is playing based on how many [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=311.04s)]
*  chips they have in front of them. It's a great point. This theory of ICM, which is like independent [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  chip model is exactly what you just said. The craziest thing for you, Burke happens right at [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=319.6s)]
*  the money bubble. These guys start, I've never seen this before. They ultra tank. Ultra tank. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=323.36s)]
*  Oh yeah. They go in the tank for two minutes and then they fold. So obnoxious. When I used to play [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=329.6s)]
*  tournament poker, I'd sit, I'd fold ace king suited. You'd fold pocket Queens. You'd fold everything. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=334.08s)]
*  If you're on the bubble of getting into the money or you're on the bubble of getting to the final [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=340.0s)]
*  table, it just doesn't matter. Cause if there's three guys with you that have smaller chip stacks, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=343.76s)]
*  let them get blinded off. And now you're in the money or now you're on the final table. And then [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=348.56s)]
*  you'll play poker. It's like, go get up, go have some dinner. I'm back in an hour. Don't even look [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=352.24s)]
*  at your cards. If you can cruise your way there, it's a totally different kind of game. Totally [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=356.4s)]
*  different. There's a guy that was tanking. He's a really lovely guy. A British guy. I offered him [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  the min cash just to stop taking. I was like, please stop taking for four minutes and folding [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=366.23999999999995s)]
*  your ass. I'll just meet at his action. I had a guy do this in a tournament and I timed it with [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=372.64s)]
*  the rest of the table. I took out my phone. I timed it and I said, whatever number of seconds you do, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=377.52s)]
*  I'm doubling. And I just did that. It was so obnoxious that the entire table, like the guy [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=382.24s)]
*  finally stopped. Well, in the, in the a hundred K we actually had a better setup, which is that [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=389.04s)]
*  we had these iPads on the table and everybody gets a 32nd shot clock. So you can't really fuck [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=392.96000000000004s)]
*  around. But then in these big field events, they're not going to have iPads on a hundred tables, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  obviously. Yes. And so instead people just tank forever. And then you have to call the floor and [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=404.56s)]
*  you have to call time on these folks. The funniest thing though, was like the last tournament I bought [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=409.2s)]
*  in for was a 10 K secret bounty, which means that on day two, when you knock somebody out, you [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=413.12s)]
*  actually, everybody stops the action. You go up on stage and you pull like out of like treasure [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=418.32s)]
*  hunting. And some of these bounties can be like a million bucks. And obviously there's a lot of [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=422.96s)]
*  people there that kind of recognize me. And when they saw me in the 10 K secret bounty, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=428.8s)]
*  there was like a movement. It was so funny. They were like, if you win the secret bounty [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=433.59999999999997s)]
*  and you win the million, we're going to revolt and burn the Paris Paris. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=438.48s)]
*  And I thought, you know, it's true. It'd be patently unfair if I was the one that won that [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=445.52000000000004s)]
*  million dollar secret bounty. How many selfies did you take on Southwest? That's the question [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=449.04s)]
*  everybody wants to know. How many people recognize you on Southwest and what was the shame that you [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=453.04s)]
*  felt? It was great. I'm going to fly. I'm going to fly Southwest to Vegas all the time. No, it's [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=457.92s)]
*  fucking great. It literally was honestly to get from my house to the gate where you stand to get [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=462.40000000000003s)]
*  into the plane. It was like plus or maybe 15 minutes more than just driving on the tarmac. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=467.68s)]
*  Like it was a nothing burger. J. Cole. It's amazing what a down market could do to people. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=472.16s)]
*  What is it, Brad? This is the victory of the age of fitness. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=479.36s)]
*  Chema. Absolutely. Chema. Southwest. You were in the first row. You were in the front row. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=484.08s)]
*  Southwest. All right, listen, there's a big docket today. We've got a lot on the plate. David Sachs [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=491.12s)]
*  is busy in a star chamber right now selecting the next president of the United States. He's [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=495.28s)]
*  picking a VP and the cabinet for whoever's going to win. So he couldn't make it today. So we brought [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=500.08s)]
*  the fifth bestie, Brad Gerstner back and great timing because the Fed decided to pause rate [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=504.32s)]
*  hikes in just yesterday, I guess. And this would have been the 11th consecutive rate hike. Is that [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=509.35999999999996s)]
*  about right? Sounds right. And they anticipated two more 25 basis hikes before the end of the year. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=517.1999999999999s)]
*  So here's just the Fed funds effective rate. So you can all can see it here over time. And there [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  was also some big news this week. Couple of 2023 IPO candidates started to be floated. Obviously, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=531.0400000000001s)]
*  we've been hearing about Reddit and Shripe for a while, but ARM confidentially filed for an IPO [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=538.96s)]
*  back in April. And they're seeking to raise between eight and 10 billion later this year. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=543.6s)]
*  That would be a pretty big deal for SoftBank, which owns the firm. And that could, I guess, save [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=548.0s)]
*  SoftBank, which has had a just a brutal run with the two different [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=557.2800000000001s)]
*  opportunity funds. Save SoftBank. The ARM deal is being done. What's the valuation it's being done [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=562.08s)]
*  at SoftBank acquired arm for 32 billion in 2016. They don't know the valuation right now. They [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=567.84s)]
*  haven't put that out there yet. I mean, they were originally looking for anywhere from 30 to 70. But [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=573.2800000000001s)]
*  Brad, where do you think that comes out? I have no idea. I think that [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=577.44s)]
*  they're shopping to get these anchor tenants into ARM. If the IPO market was super hot, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=582.0s)]
*  and this was really easy to get done, this would have been done. So I think they're tiptoeing out [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=588.64s)]
*  because they need to get it into the public market. But I think that anybody who does an IPO today, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=594.88s)]
*  okay, is going to demand a rate of return into that offering. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=603.68s)]
*  That is a significant margin of safety relative to all deals that were done in 2021. And what that [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=611.28s)]
*  means is on the road show investment banks go and they try to drum up demand, they want to have [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=618.3199999999999s)]
*  anchors in the IPO book, they call firms like ours, they call strategic investors, they want to size [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=623.92s)]
*  up what that is. And they give you their expectation of fair value or where they think [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=630.4s)]
*  the IPO will trade to. Of course, you meet with management, you ascertain and develop your own [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=636.3199999999999s)]
*  expectations of fair value. What I'm saying is maybe in the peak, in 2021, people were getting [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=642.48s)]
*  thinner and thinner in terms of the margin of safety they demand. My expectations, whether it's [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=650.0799999999999s)]
*  Arm, whether it's Databricks or other companies that are starting to queue up, and these are [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=655.52s)]
*  fantastic companies, right? Make no mistake about it. Nvidia tried to buy Arm and Databricks is [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=660.0799999999999s)]
*  doing over a billion in revenue, growing extraordinarily fast, led by an incredible team. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=666.0s)]
*  But in order to get into the public markets, they have to step in with a bigger discount than they [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=670.48s)]
*  would have, you know, pre this correction. And just to put some numbers on it, Arm had agreed [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=676.48s)]
*  to be acquired by Nvidia for 40 billion before the talks fell through. That was due to regulatory [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=682.88s)]
*  scrutiny. Bloomberg says Arm is aiming for a valuation of 70 billion. Obviously, there's no [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=687.52s)]
*  confirmation about that. That's just the news, hopefully intelligently speculating about it. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=691.92s)]
*  What exactly would you be buying for $70 billion? I thought they missed it. Yeah. Arm had a window [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=695.76s)]
*  where they had to make some really important product decisions to be able to actually have [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=702.64s)]
*  reference designs that actually made sense beyond just simple mobile processors and CPUs. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=707.28s)]
*  And they don't have any of that. So they have a good cash cow business. It's probably worth [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=712.72s)]
*  25 billion. They paid 30 some odd. 32. They could have gotten it out for 40 something, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=716.9599999999999s)]
*  but it's a mid 20s billion dollar company. No more. And if you're in if you buy it at the 20s, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=722.56s)]
*  you're buying a cash flow yielding asset. And the good luck to all the players, I guess is what I [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=729.4399999999999s)]
*  would say. Clearly, it's a function of SoftBank seeking liquidity, right? I mean, they have had [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=734.0s)]
*  this position for how many years now? Four years? No more. I think this was six, maybe six years. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=740.56s)]
*  So they're that? Yeah. When did they buy it? Was it 2016? I think it was longer. Yeah, 2016. They [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=748.24s)]
*  bought it. So this has been in the fiscal year ending March, the vision fund alone took a 32 [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=753.04s)]
*  billion dollar write down. Obviously, SoftBank has a big chunk of the vision fund, but this is [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=758.72s)]
*  not in the vision fund. It's not in the vision fund. Exactly. It's on balance sheet. Yeah. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=765.12s)]
*  But it's clearly a liquidity driver for them. I don't think that this is, you know, first of all, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=771.12s)]
*  Jason, I don't think the point about SoftBank needs saving is necessarily true. It's not a company [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=776.08s)]
*  that needs saving, but they've certainly taken some hits. Well, they could use a win. This is [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=780.96s)]
*  what my point Yeah, yeah, they could use a win. But the last two quarterly calls, you know, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=783.92s)]
*  Masayoshi san was pretty repentant and humble. Right. In fact, he used that exact language. We [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=791.5999999999999s)]
*  talked about it here. So this big liquidity need at some point for the business. So they can get [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=797.92s)]
*  this thing out and get liquid on it. It would certainly support the balance sheet more than [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=803.1999999999999s)]
*  anything. You know, the market is on a tear this year, Brad, is there now that everybody's buying [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=807.36s)]
*  back into tech stocks, I guess, two questions, why is everybody suddenly buying into tech stocks [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=813.68s)]
*  when people think there's going to be a recession, and consumers have run out of money? And yeah, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=820.0799999999999s)]
*  what what's the thinking here of why so much money has gone to tech and this incredible rally? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=828.4799999999999s)]
*  It's been great to watch, but people seem to be perplexed by the rally. And then the Fed, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=833.28s)]
*  even though they didn't do a rate hike, seem to put cold water on and say, Hey, listen, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=838.4799999999999s)]
*  don't get ahead of yourselves, we're gonna probably do rate hikes later in the year, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=842.96s)]
*  we all have short memories. You know, tech had a devastating year in 2022. So this is a bit of a [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=845.9200000000001s)]
*  reversion to the mean, right? If you remember the chart, we you know, we showed a lot on this pod [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=852.4000000000001s)]
*  last year, at the end of starting at the end of 2021, was that we were trading at, you know, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=856.96s)]
*  multiples that were, you know, 50 to 70% above their 10 year average. And at the trough, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=864.1600000000001s)]
*  we were trading about 30 to 40% below the 10 year average, right? So the market corrected, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=870.64s)]
*  it overshoots on the upside, because rates went to zero. And by the end of 2022, when you had Larry [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=875.52s)]
*  Summers and others who were going out and saying, we don't know what the upper bound of inflation [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=881.36s)]
*  and rates is, that's really scary to the markets. And so you had this overshoot to the downside, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=887.04s)]
*  we're still trading below the 10 year average for internet and software companies based upon [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=892.4s)]
*  our numbers. And so when you look at this, as we said, at the end of last year, the framework [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=898.4s)]
*  changed early in this year, all of 22 was about two things is inflation going higher, and our rates [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=903.1999999999999s)]
*  going higher. And those things are debilitating for growth assets and growth multiples. By the [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=910.88s)]
*  beginning of this year, we started to have confidence that inflation had peaked, which [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=916.48s)]
*  meant that rates were largely in kind of, you know, spitting distance of their final destination. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=922.24s)]
*  And the framework shift to economy, are we going to have a hard landing? Now remember, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=928.64s)]
*  at the start of the year, Mike Wilson from Oregon Stanley, who may give him credit made the call in [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=933.92s)]
*  2022. He said 22 was going to be awful. He was right. But he stayed in that bearish position [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=938.88s)]
*  at the beginning of 2021, said the economy is going to hit the skids in q1, and that we're [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=945.52s)]
*  going to revisit 3000 or 3200 on the S&P. Instead, we're sitting at 4300. So he was tragically wrong [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=951.2s)]
*  at the beginning of this year, because again, he was fighting, I think, the last battle that he [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=960.0s)]
*  that was won, as opposed to looking ahead and saying, this is no longer about rates and inflation. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=965.44s)]
*  So the NASDAQ has moved 30% to start this year, you know, the Fed said yesterday, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=971.44s)]
*  we're hitting pause, you know, the quote from Chairman Powell that has everybody a little bit [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=976.64s)]
*  perplexed, is on the one hand, he says we're data dependent. On the other hand, he said, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=982.08s)]
*  we're likely to have more rate hikes, right? And that rates are going to stay high for a couple [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=987.76s)]
*  years. Well, if we're data, you can't have it both ways. If we're data dependent, we have a [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=994.16s)]
*  hard landing like Stan Druckenmiller thinks we're going to have in Q4 this year, then rates are [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=999.52s)]
*  going to get cut. But the market seems to like this. And let's talk about where we are. The 10 [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1004.32s)]
*  years at about 3.7, the S&P is basically flat in terms of where it was and where it was before and [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1011.0400000000001s)]
*  where it was after the rate hike announcement. The economy appears to be reasonably good, 80% [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1018.24s)]
*  of earnings in Q1B. The guides were okay. Stan Druckenmiller said I shifted, you know, he pulled [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1025.92s)]
*  forward when he thought we're going to have a hard landing based upon the bank crisis, which now [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1033.12s)]
*  feels like it's a distant memory for many. And he's now calling for potentially a hard landing in Q4. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1037.9199999999998s)]
*  So the Fed just came out and said, No, we're not going to have a hard landing in Q4. We think we're [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1044.4799999999998s)]
*  going to have 1% growth. They think that inflation to end the year is going to be at 3.2% versus the [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1048.8s)]
*  3.7% Goldman consensus. What I would say is, you know, we've moved, but we're still below the 10 [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1056.0s)]
*  year average. But you have to start paying attention now to individual stocks that have likely gotten [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1063.04s)]
*  ahead of themselves or where they've taken out. What's an example of that? Who's gotten ahead of [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1069.04s)]
*  a lot of the return? Facebook, Apple, Microsoft. You know, I think a lot of the AI related stocks [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1072.88s)]
*  are now at or within 10% of our end of year price target. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1080.6399999999999s)]
*  And when you when you see that take something like Nvidia, if I'm playing at home, or I'm a, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1086.0s)]
*  you know, a professional investor, I may say, Oh, I'm going to go sell some long dated calls to buy [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1091.04s)]
*  a little protection to the downside. I don't think there's any problems with Nvidia. I think they're [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1096.48s)]
*  going to continue to perform. I think they're beat their numbers for the balance of the year. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1101.12s)]
*  But you know, remember, at the start of the year, people thought they were going to miss their [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1105.9199999999998s)]
*  numbers for data center, people thought data center revenues this year were going to be negative. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1109.52s)]
*  And they just revised their guide from 7 billion in q2 to 11 billion in q2. So they've absolutely [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1115.12s)]
*  blistered their numbers. And the stocks gone from $125, you know, to over $400. So when you have [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1122.8s)]
*  those parabolic moves, just like we did with rates last year, I think it's wise to say it's a fantastic [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1130.96s)]
*  company, we want to be involved, it's going to continue to be one of our larger positions. But [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1136.96s)]
*  if I can lock in 20% yield, by selling calls six months out, I think that's a reasonable risk reward. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1141.2s)]
*  So you know, I think that's where we are. And now the question really becomes and it's unknown and [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1149.2s)]
*  unknowable, right? Are we going to have a soft landing, a medium landing, a hard landing in q4 [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1154.88s)]
*  and rolling into next year? And I would say as an investor, I'm very data dependent, you know, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1160.4s)]
*  we're talking to companies, we're looking at a point should we all be looking at at this point, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1165.04s)]
*  Chamath, you think jobs, unemployment, just these stocks in their multiples? And how are you looking [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1168.8799999999999s)]
*  at it as a capital allocator to month? Still on the sidelines? What have I said, like a broken [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1174.96s)]
*  record, rates are going to be higher than you want, and they're going to be around for longer [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1180.1599999999999s)]
*  than you like. And now Powell is basically telling you the same thing. So we're almost at the end of, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1183.68s)]
*  I think the bottoming though. I don't agree with Druckenmiller. I think he's wrong. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1193.84s)]
*  On which part that doesn't be a hard landing in Q4? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1199.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. And the reason there's not going to be a hard landing is you just saw China today, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1202.4s)]
*  basically say we're going to start to rip in trillions of dollars, they're going to stimulate [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1206.24s)]
*  the economy. You can't have a hard landing when China's printing trillions of dollars, not possible. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1209.6s)]
*  So I think that what Powell was forecasting is that if China starts to basically turn on the money [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1214.48s)]
*  printer and go through a huge spate of quantitative easing, it's going to just inflate everything, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1222.0s)]
*  because they're just such a critical artery to the world economy. And so you just have to get [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1229.04s)]
*  prepared for rates just being sticky and inflation being sticky. And I think that that's probably the [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1233.36s)]
*  most reasonable base case for the rest of the decade. Rest of the decade, seven more years. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1240.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. And so in that environment, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1245.04s)]
*  the problem is that now you have the seven or eight most valuable tech stocks priced to perfection, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1247.2s)]
*  yet again, if you look at their enterprise value over their net income, these things are trading at [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1251.8400000000001s)]
*  astronomical yields that are less than half of the two year note, and now approaching sometimes less [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1256.88s)]
*  than half of the 10 year note, government bonds, that makes no sense. And if you subtract out those [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1265.1200000000001s)]
*  seven or eight biggest companies in the S&P 500, the S&P has not been a great asset. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1273.76s)]
*  So I think the equal weighted index, Brad, you probably know the exact number, the equal weighted [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1280.56s)]
*  index is just shit. So what does all this mean? I think it means that people are psychologically [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1284.32s)]
*  exhausted with having lost money. They are psychologically wanting to will the market up, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1290.9599999999998s)]
*  they want to psychologically believe whatever will allow them to do the right thing. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1296.0s)]
*  And I think that whatever will allow them to influence rates getting cut. But I think the most [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1301.92s)]
*  reasonable bear cases rates aren't getting cut. And whatever hope you had of rates getting cut just [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1310.56s)]
*  went out the window today, because there is no world in which you cut rates when China's going to [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1314.16s)]
*  print a trillion dollars or more. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1317.76s)]
*  Freeburg, a lot of people seem to think that this big run up in the markets is AI related. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1319.12s)]
*  Everybody's got an AI angle for their company. Some of them super valid, like Microsoft and Google. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1325.28s)]
*  Other ones feels kind of speculative. We talked about BuzzFeed talked about having AI journalists [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1330.0s)]
*  and their stock, which looks like it's going to be delisted, got a quick pop. Do you think the AI [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1335.68s)]
*  actually coming to market, driving efficiency, driving revenue for companies is going to happen [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1344.16s)]
*  in the short to midterm? Or is it more like midterm to long term? In other words, is the AI rally [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1350.72s)]
*  overheated and fake? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1356.0800000000002s)]
*  I don't know if I would assume that the pricing of equities is entirely driven by AI. I think [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1357.36s)]
*  there's a lot of factors, including a lot of folks maybe being on the sidelines for too long and [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1366.6399999999999s)]
*  needing to come and buy in at the same time. But I do think that there's a radical realization [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1372.4799999999998s)]
*  underway that a lot of businesses that are dependent on services that might be replaced [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1380.16s)]
*  by AI don't necessarily have the longevity today. Those are businesses that have been severely hurt [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1388.24s)]
*  by the point of view of what AI could bring to market and bring to industry. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1395.0400000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff happening on the short side. On the long side, I think it's a distribution [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1400.16s)]
*  curve on how quickly different industries will be affected in a positive way by AI. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1405.68s)]
*  Certainly, the most obvious is demand for chips because all this infrastructure is being built [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1412.5600000000002s)]
*  out. That's the first. With a high discount rate, which is the environment we're in today, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1417.1200000000001s)]
*  you can more quickly bet on those opportunities. You see a disproportionate bubbling in valuation [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1423.04s)]
*  and multiples on businesses like that. There are other businesses that are further down, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1428.5600000000002s)]
*  services businesses. How long until lawyers are able to leverage AI? How long until investment [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1435.04s)]
*  banks are going to be leveraging AI to create new products and improve their margins? There's a lot [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1441.68s)]
*  of speculation and a lot of ideas, but the discount rate is quite high right now. That's probably a [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1446.8s)]
*  few years out to the point that the fuzziness wipes out the potential value. What do you mean [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1451.3600000000001s)]
*  by the discount rate in this context? Let's say that I think that investment banks are [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1455.52s)]
*  going to be severely changed in 7 to 10 years. That's the time horizon. I think that their [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1460.0s)]
*  business is going to improve because of AI as an example, or factory machinery automation, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1465.52s)]
*  manufacturing businesses, probably 10 to 15 years. I can't really give them that much credit today. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1472.08s)]
*  I apply a higher discount rate there, but there are other industries that are certainly being [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1478.72s)]
*  affected much more quickly. I'm sure Brad and his team of finance wizards probably have a [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1482.64s)]
*  board where they have this list of all the industries that are going to be affected and [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1490.0s)]
*  what time horizon. That's the way you could think about this. Over different time horizons, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1493.68s)]
*  you could accrue some net improvement to earnings and say, okay, you apply a discount rate to that. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1498.16s)]
*  Here's how much the stock should trade up. That's one way to think about this. I don't [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1503.52s)]
*  think it's everything everywhere all at once. Great reference, Brad. Great, by the way, I just [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1508.0s)]
*  saw that movie. I had to reference it because I saw it over the weekend. Have you seen that movie? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1515.2s)]
*  Of course. Of course. Yeah. What we should take an unbelievable film. I had not seen that film. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1519.44s)]
*  I had kept postponing it. Incredible. Anyway, shout out. What movie? It's everything everywhere [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1524.24s)]
*  all at once. It won best picture at the Oscars last year. I don't trust the best picture awards [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1530.3200000000002s)]
*  at the Oscars for a few years. I've just been duped by that award. Like you get some really [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1536.88s)]
*  crap ass movies that are like, watch this movie and then report back. Let's I won't even say more [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1542.16s)]
*  politically correct or whatever. And then they get this award signaling, they were doing a little [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1547.12s)]
*  catch up because of Oscar. So white the movement to try to balance things out. In fact, people [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1551.36s)]
*  Well, that doesn't exactly reinforce trust that actually destroys complete trust and [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1557.04s)]
*  reputational credibility. Yes, they're virtuous. And actually, that was something people said that [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1561.36s)]
*  everything everywhere all at once was possibly because it's an Asian cat. I don't even know what [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1566.8799999999999s)]
*  is it? What is it? It's a sci fi adventure surrealist kind of romp. Michelle Yo is in it. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1572.0s)]
*  She's very famous from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Correct. Kwan is in it, who played short [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1579.68s)]
*  round in Indiana Jones. Indiana Jones. Yeah. And I don't do my impersonation, but I would get [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1587.28s)]
*  canceled for doing the impersonation of him. In that that guy must be like fucking 70 years old. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1593.84s)]
*  Yeah, no, he's like, he's like 50 or something. But it's pretty great because he also won. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1599.44s)]
*  Best actor, best supporting actor. And there are all these pictures of him with Harrison Ford and [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1605.68s)]
*  Steven Spielberg. The guys that made it are like music video directors, you got to go see this [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1611.0400000000002s)]
*  film. It's really good. It's on a visual basis. Theater, you have to go to watch it on Apple TV [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1617.3600000000001s)]
*  in one of your theaters tonight. Go to your theaters. Go to the theater on your plane and [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1625.44s)]
*  watch it. Actually, we'll do that. I'll do that. I'll do that. I go to the bathroom. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1629.44s)]
*  And it's a long flight back from Italy. So I'm taking my time. And I see that. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1638.64s)]
*  A awesome as sub soap that I can't afford. It's like 100. So yeah, that one. So I see that and [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1643.92s)]
*  I'm like, wait a second. So I look in the cabinet underneath. I'm like, if there's two up here, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1650.0800000000002s)]
*  there's got to be six down below. So I check in the galley. Of course, there's six down there. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1653.44s)]
*  I put two I boost two in my bathroom, which I'm still not in my bathroom here. I check out he's [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1658.16s)]
*  got a TV setup. So I'm like, Oh, I wonder what movies are on here. And it's Netflix. He's got [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1668.0s)]
*  so much bandwidth on that frickin plane that you can see on the plane. You don't have to download [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1672.4s)]
*  your movies before you take off on your mouse plane. All right, let's get back to work here. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1678.4s)]
*  By the way, have you seen that movie? Yeah, incredible movie. He's got to watch it. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1683.76s)]
*  It's not the best film of the that was tar, but I don't want to get into it with Jamal. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1688.56s)]
*  Oh my god, I tried to watch tar. That movie sucks. Balls. It was so boring and fucking [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1693.1200000000001s)]
*  self absorbed and contrived. For anybody that has sleeping issues and otherwise needs to use a [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1700.24s)]
*  sleeping aid, I would just put that movie on because, you know, once you see Cate Blanch had [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1708.24s)]
*  blathering on and walking back and forth from her kids fucking school and then some crappy piano [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1712.72s)]
*  play you'll fall asleep. And then what puts you to bed faster, Chema, ambient, tar, or science [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1717.68s)]
*  corner, science corner, which one I actually love science corner. I don't take I don't take [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1726.48s)]
*  sleep aids. I've taken ambient three times in my life. Yeah, but that was recreationally during [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1731.84s)]
*  the day. That's no, no, it was prescribed to me because I wanted to try it. I also tried Lunez [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1736.64s)]
*  the once they were they're both like, be careful with that stuff, man. You'll start tweeting weird [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1740.88s)]
*  shit. Be careful. I tried those sleeping aids four times in my life and you wake up I wake up with [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1746.0800000000002s)]
*  it has a really bad tail effect. So like, oh, yeah, I wake up super groggy. I only get five or six [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1751.8400000000001s)]
*  hours of sleep with it. So anyways, I do take melatonin and that's really good. That works. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1757.2s)]
*  That's natural. It does a trick does a trick for me and then I try to just everybody on melatonin [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1762.48s)]
*  all of a sudden, like everybody I go take melatonin. Are you sure? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1766.88s)]
*  Just a natural way to ease into sleep. Yeah, for me, what I do is like I use it as part of a [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1769.92s)]
*  routine where like, typically around 10, like all the, you know, devices things get silenced and [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1774.64s)]
*  do not disturb mode. And I'm in a really restful place by 10 o'clock. I mean, usually by 10 15 to [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1781.1200000000001s)]
*  1030. I'm out like a light. I just got this infrared sauna. You guys have infrared saunas. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1786.48s)]
*  This is like the new hotness and man, that is incredible. You get a heart rate goes way up and [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1792.16s)]
*  then you sleep like a baby. Okay, let's get back to AI. Brad, are people getting too much credit [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1797.68s)]
*  in their stock prices? And is the contrast therapy after the infrared sauna? I don't know what [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1802.88s)]
*  contrast therapy is. What does that mean? When you do the hot, then you jump into like an ice bath. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1808.16s)]
*  No, I'm getting an ice bath. Next for my little outdoor sauna area. And I'm going to start doing [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1812.24s)]
*  that. I did that with my friend, Antonio, Antonio, friend of the pot, Antonio, gracias. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1817.68s)]
*  He's got one of those cold plunges. We jump in the cold plunge together. He's got this thing [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1822.0800000000002s)]
*  at 45 fricking degrees. He says, don't try to do too much. You'll have a heart attack. So I go in, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1825.28s)]
*  I get 45 seconds in, I start breathing like really heavily. And I'm like, I gotta get the [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1830.24s)]
*  hell out of here. He does six minutes. Yeah, I do four minutes three times a week. What temperature, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1836.48s)]
*  what temperature? 42 to 44. The research paper that everybody references now, I think her name [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1844.16s)]
*  is Suzanne Soderberg or something like that. She's the Swedish researcher. Huberman did it on his [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1849.6000000000001s)]
*  podcast that Rogan did it. Anyways, the data is like, an hour like a little less than an hour [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1855.76s)]
*  of heat. And 11 minutes of cold per week per week was shown to be physiologically optimal. So I do [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1862.64s)]
*  it three times a week, 20 minutes of heat, followed by four minutes of cold plunge three [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1869.44s)]
*  times a week. Do you have like a cold plunge where you set the dial on it? Or is it? No, no, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1874.8s)]
*  I just, I do old school. I use the Mr. Steam in my bathroom. Because after I'm done working out, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1878.48s)]
*  the last thing I want to do is schlep outside, find my slippers, put on a robe. I'm not going [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1885.8400000000001s)]
*  to do any of that. So I walk upstairs, I do the Mr. Steam at like 110 degrees. And then [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1889.76s)]
*  while I'm working out, somebody just makes an ice bath for me and put a bunch of ice in a tub, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1895.2s)]
*  fill it with water and just jump in it. So they do it, do they carve like a bunch of baby seals [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1900.64s)]
*  in ice? And then they just when you get in, push the ice cubes were made to look like my face. So [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1905.68s)]
*  I have these shapes of yourself. So I'm like, yeah. No infrared gets up to like 130 140 degrees, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1910.88s)]
*  and your heart rate will go up to 140 150 degrees in this. It's all different experiences. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1919.52s)]
*  I was recently on a ski trip. Yeah. And it's a this extraordinary sauna. It's wood fired. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1923.84s)]
*  Tell me about this. So that's the lead guide on this trip. We go down there, he gets the thing [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1931.52s)]
*  heated up before we show up, right. And I show up with this great athlete down there, and we go in [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1937.6s)]
*  the hotbox, because, you know, this is the thing to do. Yeah. And I look at the thermostat, I think [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1942.1599999999999s)]
*  it's broken. It shows like, it's hard pegged at like 225 degrees Fahrenheit. That's a lot. You walk [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1948.0s)]
*  in your I mean, you slow cook meat at 225. That's my lips are burning, you know, and this person [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1955.6s)]
*  sitting in there is like, now this is the way you do it, right? Tough guys, you know, do it at this [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1964.72s)]
*  temperature, like, all right, so you know, we sit in there for like 10, 10 minutes, and then we go [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1969.28s)]
*  and we jump in, you know, in a frozen lake. And about 10 minutes later, we're taking off, we had [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1973.28s)]
*  to leave this particular place. And, you know, people are waving goodbye, and they're looking, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1978.48s)]
*  you know, they have to look over the sauna, as they're waving goodbye. And they notice that the [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1984.32s)]
*  sauna is on fire. Ah, yeah. That's basically what happens when you go to 220. Unbelievable. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1988.32s)]
*  People are taking this a bit to the excess. It's a little crazy. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=1997.12s)]
*  All right, so back to back to the docket here. AI. Yeah, are people getting too much credit in [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2000.5600000000002s)]
*  public markets kind of running with this before it's actually ready for prime time? Just to add to [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2004.88s)]
*  Freeberg's point here. There are a lot of people talking about doing things in startups, I see [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2010.24s)]
*  people actually doing things, I would say four out of five startups that we've invested in, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2015.28s)]
*  and the majority of them that we're being pitched on right now are not only talking about AI, which [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2019.6000000000001s)]
*  they were all talking about three years ago, they're actually implementing AI. And so, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2023.8400000000001s)]
*  they're actually implementing it now because the tool sets are available. I just had a call. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2028.48s)]
*  Thank you, Freeberg, for putting me in touch with the Google people. I just did a call this past [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2033.04s)]
*  week with Google and they gave me some previews of what they're working on. I can't say anything [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2037.52s)]
*  about it, but it's it's mind blowing. I think Google's not as far behind closed AI. What's [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2041.04s)]
*  your read on Google now? We had a little kerfuffle when I when I talked about Sundar's reaction to, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2045.84s)]
*  you know, AI and the concerns that others might have on folks talking about the company. I mean, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2052.2400000000002s)]
*  what's your point of view on Google today? I don't know if you talked about this. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2057.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, no. Well, I mean, I think, you know, I had this, I had this dinner, this incredible [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2060.48s)]
*  dinner, actually, Thursday at the pub. And, you know, it's how I know Silicon Valley is back, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2066.4s)]
*  because it was just like serendipitous, we threw it together in the afternoon, you had this like, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2071.76s)]
*  four extraordinary, you know, CEOs there. And, you know, you had Mustafa, one of the co founders, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2075.44s)]
*  DeepMind there and Rich Barton from Expedia and so it's just just an incredible group. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2082.48s)]
*  And the $20 trillion question is, how does the entire open architecture of the web get [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2086.88s)]
*  re architected in the age of AI? Another way of asking the question, because we're all kind of [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2093.76s)]
*  playing small ball, right? We're all talking about, oh, you know, our TPUs, GPUs, you know, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2099.2000000000003s)]
*  and what cloud is going to get accelerated. That's kind of the small ball. The big ball here, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2104.0s)]
*  the $20 trillion question that has defined the entire internet for our entire careers, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2108.88s)]
*  has been web search. And I will tell you that the conversation around that table, there's [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2115.6000000000004s)]
*  increasing confidence that whatever comes next, right, the top of the funnel is up for grabs. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2122.48s)]
*  And all of those dollars over a period, again, a five years, seven years, is going to get [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2128.5600000000004s)]
*  redistributed. And make no mistake, Google is well positioned to make its claim for that. But its [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2133.6800000000003s)]
*  claim is going to come at the expense of search. And so Google may create the best AI in the world, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2141.28s)]
*  but it's going to have to fight off the cannibalization of core search. And the [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2148.8s)]
*  question is, in this new thing. And so Rich Barton, you know, an incredible product founder, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2152.88s)]
*  right? Think about Expedia. CEO Zillow? Yes, and Zillow. So he's founder of Expedia and founder [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2159.6000000000004s)]
*  Zillow, two vertical search engines that dominated right there, particular verticals. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2164.7200000000003s)]
*  And the topic of the conversation was that the new UI, right, the new way you interact with your [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2170.08s)]
*  customers, right, is not optimizing a web page. It's not optimizing an application. He calls it [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2176.56s)]
*  the race to intimacy. The race to intimacy that you have to build a conversational UI. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2184.16s)]
*  I've run that race a few times. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2191.2799999999997s)]
*  No, and it's related race. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2194.16s)]
*  That was a sprint, not a marathon. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2195.92s)]
*  Sometimes it's been a marathon. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2199.2000000000003s)]
*  Are you always on top, Jamal? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2205.0400000000004s)]
*  I run really good middle distances. And then if I need to just make it, you know, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2208.2400000000002s)]
*  run a Boston marathon, I can if I want. But I don't. Okay, yeah, sure you can. Yeah. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2212.4s)]
*  But I think, you know, I took a poll. Sorry, does he think Zillow is dead? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2216.5600000000004s)]
*  I mean, he's no longer sure what they're guessing. I mean, he's the CEO. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2220.32s)]
*  He's the CEO is the chairman. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2223.76s)]
*  Sorry, not Zillow. Sorry, not Zillow Expedia. Pardon me. What does he think about Expedia and [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2225.36s)]
*  travel? Well, you know, you and I had this conversation, Gurley chimed in the cash [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2229.0400000000004s)]
*  chimed in on Twitter. Well, you're not on Twitter, but they chimed in. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2232.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, about the conversation from last week's pod, every vertical search engine and Google itself, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2236.5600000000004s)]
*  that architecture is suspect. Right? The question is just over what timeline is it suspect, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2244.2400000000002s)]
*  but the world is moving past 10 blue links. Information retrieval that looked like a card [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2251.04s)]
*  catalog is not where we're going. You no longer need an index. You need someone to do the retrieval [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2256.4s)]
*  from the index for you. That's the new service. And extract the knowledge. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2261.7599999999998s)]
*  And yeah, that's what I mean. It's personalized to you. But I think one of the questions that's [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2265.6s)]
*  still outstanding from an architectural point of view, in terms of your interaction with all the [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2269.52s)]
*  data in the world is, are you as a user going to have a number of independent relationships [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2274.24s)]
*  with your travel search engine, your travel agent, or are you going to have a relationship [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2280.96s)]
*  with your doctor medical office and you're going to have a separate relationship with your, you know, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2285.44s)]
*  financial advisory type service? Or are you going to end up seeing similar to the challenge we have [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2290.64s)]
*  in search versus vertical search today, an aggregator of services, because there's value [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2296.56s)]
*  in cross populating the data and the knowledge about you across those services. So sure, you know, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2302.0s)]
*  I think it's going to be the you know, it's going to be the former because like, obviously, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2307.52s)]
*  there's value to the company, because every company wants to profiteer from you and monetize you in [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2311.52s)]
*  nine different ways and maximize the equity for their employees and their founders, and their [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2317.92s)]
*  board and their shareholders. But that's not what people want. Right. So like, for example, when you [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2323.2s)]
*  go to a doctor, would your doctor be better off if, you know, she also had all of your data from, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2327.2s)]
*  I don't know, pick your other service providers, of course, maybe you could make a claim that if [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2333.4399999999996s)]
*  they had all of your personal information, and they understood your risk factors, they could do [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2338.3999999999996s)]
*  a much better job. But the reason you don't do that is you want some segregated relationships, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2343.3599999999997s)]
*  aid gives you some level of privacy, but mostly it gives you control in a world of AI where you [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2348.16s)]
*  can be more conversational. The idea that humans will want to get reduced to talking to one thing [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2352.64s)]
*  for everything, I think is wrong. I think instead, it's actually going to be hyper fragmented. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2358.16s)]
*  Because the best in class use cases are going to be the things that people want and then be, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2364.48s)]
*  it gives the user control. The one thing I would tell people is, do not give up all of your data [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2371.12s)]
*  to one thing who's professing to be at all, they are going to lie to you and trick you. And you're [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2376.8799999999997s)]
*  going to have a social media problem writ large all over again. There's another way to think about [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2382.08s)]
*  this, which is the reverse of the client server model, where today, you as you are the client, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2386.0s)]
*  you are the node on the network, and you're communicating with the center of the network, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2392.48s)]
*  which is the server, which is the service provider, and all the data sits there, and you're [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2396.16s)]
*  getting data in and out of their product to suit your particular objectives. But the future may be [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2400.64s)]
*  that more data is aggregating and accruing about you, you end up becoming a server, you then have [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2405.84s)]
*  this speaks to the architecture on the internet. Imagine if every individual had their own IP [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2412.7200000000003s)]
*  address, and that individual's IP address had behind it, behind your ability to control [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2417.04s)]
*  lots of information and lots of output about all your interactions across the different network [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2423.1200000000003s)]
*  of service providers that you use. That's a very smart framework, I think. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2427.6000000000004s)]
*  You want to be able to rent that data to services and have them pay you for it. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2434.0s)]
*  I don't even think it's about rent. Yeah, as much as it is about, you should have complete... [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2437.04s)]
*  The reason rent, well, then you have to rent it. You can't give it to them because that'd be stupid. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2441.2s)]
*  That's right. Your usage, let's say the doctor says, hey, can I get access to your health data, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2445.2s)]
*  or sorry, your Apple Watch activity data for the last year. You then have the option to provide [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2452.0s)]
*  that data to them through some permission type service that you then make available. So there [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2456.8s)]
*  will be interconnectivity amongst the service providers, but entirely gated and controlled by [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2461.68s)]
*  the user. Look, you're seeing this upfront now with Reddit. When in this world, the people that [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2465.6s)]
*  create the content are actually in control of the data. And if you try to like monetize an API [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2472.0s)]
*  without paying the people that created it or giving them control, they'll revolt. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2478.24s)]
*  You're seeing it happen. Now Reddit lost what, 90 some odd X percent of all of their content [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2482.4s)]
*  because the mods were like, fuck you to Reddit. Well, think of that writ large where everybody [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2487.68s)]
*  is asked, Hey, I'm this great service. Hey, I'm this great service. I can solve X, Y, and Z [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2492.16s)]
*  problem for you. Just give me all your data. And then if you're not asking, well, what do I get? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2497.04s)]
*  And they're like, well, you're going to get a whiz bang service. And that's all they say. You're [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2502.24s)]
*  being tricked. It's already happening. I mean, there's an open source lawsuit against Microsoft's [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2506.16s)]
*  GitHub co-pilot and you have the Getty lawsuit. And, you know, there's also a corollary for this. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2511.52s)]
*  Google tried to kill Expedia already. They tried to kill Yelp and it didn't work. Folks use both [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2517.6s)]
*  services. And, you know, if you, if you are trying to boil the ocean, like chat, GPT might, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2522.72s)]
*  I think it's not going to work because there's going to be so much innovation, so much community [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2528.3199999999997s)]
*  brand and all that kind of stuff. And these LLMs seem to be trending towards good enough or some [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2532.3199999999997s)]
*  kind of parody that I think you're right. Your mouth people are just not going to give their data [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2537.8399999999997s)]
*  over wholesale. I've been using the Zillow plugin to get exact. And the Zillow plugin sucks on chat [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2541.76s)]
*  GPT. It's getting slightly better. What is the wrong model? Well, it's going to live. This will [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2547.76s)]
*  exist on Zillow site. Zillow will not let chat GPT take their business. You're going to go to [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2552.8s)]
*  Zillow site and you're going to say, Hey, show me homes that have a sauna and an ice plunge. And [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2557.84s)]
*  that are four bedrooms and that are, you know, fixer uppers or are not fixer uppers and have [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2562.6400000000003s)]
*  in-suite bathrooms and whatever. And it's just going to give you that list. Why would they give [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2568.0s)]
*  that business to closed AI? Can I take a crack just at summarizing what we all just said, because [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2571.84s)]
*  your initial question was, Friedberg was like, what does this mean for Google? Well, we all just said [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2577.52s)]
*  that what we're certain of is there's not going to be 10 blue links and a model of search that they [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2582.8s)]
*  have monetized in a way that has been the most prolific business model in the history of [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2588.64s)]
*  capitalism. Right. So that's a problem for them, you know, from a business model perspective. So [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2593.28s)]
*  they're going to have to reinvent their business. That's going to be hard to do. It's like rebuilding [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2599.0400000000004s)]
*  the plane on the fly. But then if you just go to the two models that we outlined here, on the one [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2602.2400000000002s)]
*  hand, Chema said, you know, you're going to work with all of these agents. That's exactly what Mark [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2607.6000000000004s)]
*  Zuckerberg said on Lex. He's like, you're not going to have one super agent. You're going to have, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2611.76s)]
*  you know, hundreds of agents. And he thinks of WhatsApp and all of his platforms as the new open [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2615.92s)]
*  web where all of these agents will live and you'll interact with them. You'll interact with your [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2621.28s)]
*  Zillow agent there. You'll interact with your booking agent, your Expedia agent there, etc. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2625.1200000000003s)]
*  On the other hand, Chad GPT, Pi at Inflection, Reid Hoffman and Mustafa and many others think [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2630.2400000000002s)]
*  that the benefits of general intelligence, this will be the first time that we solve vertical [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2637.92s)]
*  problems horizontally. Right. And their metaphor, the compare there is we all don't have a hundred [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2644.8s)]
*  personal assistants in our office. You have one that gets to know you really well. They get to [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2651.76s)]
*  know what you like to wear, how you like to travel, the things you like to eat, the things you like in [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2656.7200000000003s)]
*  your house, how many kids you have. So there's real leverage in that, in that horizontal knowledge [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2661.2000000000003s)]
*  that can then be applied to these different verticals. I think the answer lies in between [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2667.2000000000003s)]
*  your personal assistant will do a lot of the general stuff. Okay. Whether it's Pi, Chad GPT, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2672.24s)]
*  whatever Googs comes up with, etc. But I think they will subcontract the work, whether they chain [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2678.08s)]
*  it out via, you know, behind the scene, you know, mechanism to other agents. So for example, if [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2683.6s)]
*  you're interested in traveling to this undisclosed location that I'm at in Europe right now, you know, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2691.04s)]
*  my assistant doesn't know anything about this place. So she may interact with a specialist [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2698.8s)]
*  for this particular place to get you that magical experience. So, you know, I don't think you have [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2704.56s)]
*  to pick one or the other, but architecture, $20 trillion of value on the web is built around [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2710.7200000000003s)]
*  webpages, advertising, and e commerce, right and sending traffic to those other places. And what [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2719.28s)]
*  we're all saying unequivocally is it's moving to knowledge extraction and intelligent agents. And [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2726.96s)]
*  I think that's tectonic. But I still think there'll be clicks. I you know, I have been using [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2733.76s)]
*  Bard a whole bunch and they have made massive rapid progress just to give you but one example [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2739.6s)]
*  here. I'll share my screen. It is pretty extraordinary how quickly they're figuring this out. And I did [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2744.2400000000002s)]
*  this just in the search while we're talking with the five best Greek restaurants in the Bay Area, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2749.44s)]
*  obviously came up with Kokari and you know, other ones. And then I asked it like, Hey, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2753.28s)]
*  what are the top items on each of these menus, they started putting images in and linking to Yelp. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2759.2000000000003s)]
*  And then I said, Hey, tell me the most expensive wines and it actually got that from Kokari. They [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2764.0s)]
*  have a Chateau Margaux 2009 for 1500. Chamath, I don't think it's good enough for you. But [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2769.84s)]
*  what year is it? It looks like 2009. Yeah, they have screaming eagle 2013. I don't know if that's [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2774.32s)]
*  a no go Harlan 2014. No, no, no, no, no. Anyway, Harlan's good. Harlan's good. Okay, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2780.56s)]
*  okay. Good. So we got to save. Anyway, this I did the same exact search like four weeks ago, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2788.16s)]
*  it didn't have images, and it couldn't get me the items on the menus. And these could all be links, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2792.88s)]
*  and these could all be paid links. So in these results, there's nothing to stop Google from [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2797.84s)]
*  saying, Hey, Yelp, if you want, we'll put your information here or not up to you. You choose, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2803.04s)]
*  do robots.txt, except we're gonna call it AI.txt, you tell us what you want to be included. And if [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2807.68s)]
*  you want to be included, we want, you know, it's a marketplace for clicks, we'll include three of [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2813.3599999999997s)]
*  your images with clicks, and we'll call it sponsored, they are going to be able to insert [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2817.52s)]
*  ads into here that are better than the current ads. And that will perform at a higher level. And [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2821.44s)]
*  they're going to know us. This could actually be the reverse of what everybody's thinking. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2825.68s)]
*  This could lead to higher CPMs and higher cost per click because of intent. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2829.2799999999997s)]
*  By the way, I mean, the the 2014 is actually, I think, underrated, and it's very highly rated, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2833.44s)]
*  but I think it is an excellent one. That's an excellent year. Jason, as to your point, I think, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2840.6400000000003s)]
*  all of that, I mean, that's impressive. It's true. You can also do it on chat GPT. I'll just say, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2846.2400000000002s)]
*  the number of people I interact with on a global basis, who talk about chat GPT versus Bard is like [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2851.44s)]
*  10 to one today. Now, Google has got massive change real fast. Google's got massive distribution [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2858.1600000000003s)]
*  power. Let me tell you what I what I also think. But to your point, Brad, about this, I just want [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2862.8s)]
*  to I want to respond to your barred versus GPT four. That's people are not paying attention. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2867.28s)]
*  And when Google puts this on the homepage, and start sending 5% of users to it, it's expensive [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2873.52s)]
*  to do it. People are going to have their eyes jump out of their head. I think Google's going to be [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2879.92s)]
*  chat GPT four. I'm saying it right here right now. I think they're going to beat them, because I [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2884.5600000000004s)]
*  think that they're better at indexing all this information and understanding it than anybody on [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2888.7200000000003s)]
*  the planet. And they have the largest ad network. If they get this done in the next six months, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2892.32s)]
*  I think it's going to increase the cost per click, because they're going to know so much [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2898.1600000000003s)]
*  about each user continue Brad. I know I'm in the minority here. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2901.84s)]
*  Well, no, no, I mean, listen, I think a lot of Google's revenue comes from de facto navigation [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2905.52s)]
*  of the web, they turn they turn the URL into a navigation box. There are a bunch of ads there [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2910.56s)]
*  that, you know, people click on, they don't even know they're clicking on ads. And, you know, they [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2915.76s)]
*  generate a lot of revenue off of that. But let's be clear, Google is firing at this. I just don't [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2921.2s)]
*  think it's going to be as monopolistic as they are in search. I think there are going to be other [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2927.68s)]
*  competitors who are going to be well financed, you're going to have access to the data. And today, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2931.8399999999997s)]
*  you have well north of 100 million people who are paying to, you know, a huge percentage of those to [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2938.0s)]
*  use chat GPT. And I think this, you know, it's the first competition, but, you know, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2944.48s)]

*  down. It feels like Google is so close to figuring this out. I mean, I've been doing some barred [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=2997.68s)]

*  And then the thing comes up and you talk about it. And I didn't want to change them. Do you track [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3038.64s)]
*  them and exit? Or what do you do with management? I'm going to track the exits, but I haven't exited [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3043.76s)]

*  I think what's the optimal number as a day trader, Brad? What's the optimal number of names? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3080.0s)]
*  I should have. You're not a day trader. You don't trade [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3084.48s)]
*  as a long trader. What's the number of names I should be? You have too many. I think with your [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3088.88s)]
*  level of insight, you know, on the things that you really believe in, there was such asymmetry [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3095.84s)]
*  in that position at the time that you bought it. It was your best idea. You should have put at [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3102.08s)]
*  least 30% of whatever you're going to allocate to this. That's what I'll do. Yeah. I mean, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3106.24s)]
*  it's done. Okay. I mean, listen, I'm up. What did I buy? I bought 500 shares and my basis is 47. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3112.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm at 140. So it was a good trade. Now imagine if you could, you know, 10 or 20 extra. Yeah, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3118.64s)]
*  that's what I should have done. Yeah. All right. Wait, hold on. How much have you put into all [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3123.4399999999996s)]
*  those stocks? 1.5 million. I basically took I had some money in an index fund laying around and I was [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3127.2799999999997s)]
*  like, let me do this. I did J trading as a blatant attempt to get a sponsor for this week in [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3132.64s)]
*  startups. So I was like, maybe Robinhood or E trade will sponsor this and I'll make it like a segment. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3138.08s)]
*  So I was like, let me do like a segment where I trade and see if I can secure the bag and it, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3144.4s)]
*  you know, the markets are so crushed that nobody is spending advertising from Robinhood or E trade [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3148.8799999999997s)]
*  or interactive brokers or Bloomberg. But I also did it because I wanted to become better at public [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3153.12s)]
*  market trading to your point to last week's conversation. Your mom is under understanding [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3158.32s)]
*  when to sell and when to go long when you get distributions as a VC. That was really the reason [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3163.28s)]
*  I tried to do it was just to try to have skin in the game. You know, just like learning to play PLL [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3168.1600000000003s)]
*  or you playing the RAS tournament. I just wanted to it's very, it's very easy. Once you get shares [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3172.56s)]
*  distributed to you immediately sell them and then and then hold on and then re underwrite from scratch [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3177.84s)]
*  from there. Okay. Once the money is sitting in your account, even if it takes a day, a week, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3184.8s)]
*  a month, it's not like the stock's going to rip and triple on you over the next 30 days, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3191.36s)]
*  re underwrite it from scratch and then see if you have that much conviction when you see the money [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3196.0800000000004s)]
*  in your bank account. I like it. I would just tell you guys the distributions, you know, there were [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3200.32s)]
*  a lot of firms that rode, you know, a lot of these big names, right all the way down. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3206.8s)]
*  You know, they got public but they didn't distribute much if any. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3214.96s)]
*  And it's really don't say the names but what do they rhyme with? I'll start. I'll start. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3220.0800000000004s)]
*  But what's going on? Go ahead. You go. You go next. You pick one. Not doing it. Blyger, Blyger. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3226.5600000000004s)]
*  Andresen Borowitz, Mloundersland. Freeberg just dropped off. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3234.8s)]
*  I want to be associated with this conversation. All right, listen, we all got our asses kicked. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3241.44s)]
*  Except for me, Uber's up 67% this year. Come on, come on. Let me what I was going to do. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3246.08s)]
*  Andresen Blorowitz. Just right. All of it. What tends to happen is things hit the bottom, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3252.56s)]
*  they bounce a little bit and people are so relieved that they bounced a little bit that [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3258.64s)]
*  they immediately start distributing because LPs are hammering them. LPs are like, why did you not [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3264.32s)]
*  send us this, you know, snowflake when it was at $400 a share? Why did you not send us this door dash? [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3270.96s)]
*  Why did you go through any name, you know, that you can think of? But then people compound the [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3277.2s)]
*  mistake, I think that as soon as they get a little relief, boom, it's out the door. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3283.12s)]
*  And then the thing doubles on them. And I just think, you know, part of the benefit of me having [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3288.8s)]
*  to get up every day, 5am, deal with public markets, and think about long or short, it's what we're [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3294.88s)]
*  talking about in the fall of 2021, around the table before the poker games, which is the public [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3300.72s)]
*  market is tilty, it doesn't feel good. And that, you know, we stopped making venture investments in [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3307.12s)]
*  October of 21, principally because of how we felt about public markets at that point in time. And [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3312.72s)]
*  so I think a discipline, in fact, I was meeting with a managing partner of a very big venture [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3318.4s)]
*  firm in Silicon Valley this week, they just started about a year ago, or six months ago, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3323.8399999999997s)]
*  doing public market investing. And they said it was incredibly valuable to how they think about [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3328.7999999999997s)]
*  distributions and what they're doing in the venture. That's what it's been for me, I have now [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3334.96s)]
*  started to learn how these things are priced. And I just think it's great as a learning thing for me, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3338.88s)]
*  I have to make two decisions, one to distribute to my LPs, which I just give them the shares the [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3343.04s)]
*  second I have them and let them make the decision. But then it's also personally for me, do I want [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3347.52s)]
*  to hold it or do I not? I like your suggestions. Nice punch up Chamath of looking at the cash and [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3351.44s)]
*  then deciding if you want to realize this crazy thing from CalPERS where they were like, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3355.6s)]
*  yeah, they were they were down like, for I mean, horrible returns on the venture side. And so their [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3360.24s)]
*  decision was to double down. Well, they didn't have they took like a decade off from venture, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3365.52s)]
*  the returns of what they did invest in venture were atrocious. To be fair, I don't know how the [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3371.12s)]
*  board has changed at CalPERS, but CalPERS brought in a new CIO, an entire new team. And so they can't [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3375.44s)]
*  be held liable for, you know, that track record, I did kind of see something on Twitter about I was [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3382.4s)]
*  shocked. It would be very difficult to manufacture that battle track record, if what I saw was [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3387.44s)]
*  accurate. However, I would say the team that is there now the portfolio that they're putting [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3392.88s)]
*  together and doubling down where I think venture is kind of at the bottom or bottom third and [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3398.48s)]
*  Oh, this is the bottom, you know, I think bottom third, I don't know bottom half, you know, listen, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3404.48s)]
*  in venture, you got to find three things. You got to find you know, you don't want to invest [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3409.76s)]
*  all your money at the top. So you got to get the bottom, you know, bottom third, none of us can call [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3414.64s)]
*  the bottom. But you know, last year at the end of 22, we were certainly in the bottom third evaluations. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3418.3199999999997s)]
*  Then you want to be early in a major platform disruption. I think we all agree we're early in [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3424.08s)]
*  a major platform disruption is probably the third of our careers. And then you want to back one of [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3429.68s)]
*  the best firms best brands in Silicon Valley, like if you do like and people know who those are, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3434.96s)]
*  if you do those three things, you know, simultaneously, like you got a good shot at producing really [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3439.2s)]
*  incredible vintage just to put some numbers on the CalPERS thing. So you can respond to [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3444.4s)]
*  it. America's public largest public pension CalPERS, that's California's manages some [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3447.28s)]
*  444 billion in capital on behalf of California's 1.5 million state school and public agency employees [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3452.64s)]
*  is leaning into venture. After years of bringing down its VC exposure to 1% to a 1% target, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3460.1600000000003s)]
*  the institution investor is now looking to increase its allocation more than sixfold, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3466.8s)]
*  obviously, 6%, from 800 million to 5 billion, the Financial Times reported. So that's a natural [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3470.64s)]
*  month. Well, I mean, this is the moment there's a lot of venture firms that are hard up for money. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3477.2s)]
*  And so they may have a shot, they can get allocations now in order to get into these funds. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3481.3599999999997s)]
*  The problem that they have to realize is they may be buying a bunch of toxic assets or a bunch of [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3487.68s)]
*  toxic partners in the sense that a lot of these people have been getting run over for the last [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3493.52s)]
*  three or four years. We don't know, again, we've said before, most venture investors are probably [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3498.16s)]
*  unprepared for the shock because they've never lived through one there's been a lot a lot of [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3504.88s)]
*  junior muckety mucks that were hired because they were x, y, z, middle level, executive rando company [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3509.6s)]
*  means nothing. So I don't know, I think it's smart that they have I mean, they have to be thoughtful [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3515.92s)]
*  and picking managers. How is it that the calif like, literally, it's like, I know, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3522.3999999999996s)]
*  it's incredible, it's of dollars being made in your backyard. And some genius was like, well, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3528.3999999999996s)]
*  the thing that's creating all the wealth in the world, which is in our backyard, where we probably [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3533.2799999999997s)]
*  have the best pitch in order to get into this one. We're going to reject percent and you just call [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3537.2s)]
*  Dudley only and say, Hey, give me the list of 10 and put money on those 10 and call it a day. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3541.44s)]
*  Oh, my God, that's unbelievable. That's unbelievably derelict. That's unbelievably [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3546.88s)]
*  sloppy and sorry, that's it. Sorry, let me just finish. That's actually that's the best word to [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3552.5600000000004s)]
*  use. When you look back on a decision like that, there's no numerical justification that one could [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3558.0800000000004s)]
*  have made in the 2000 teens to have made that decision except that that was an emotional [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3563.36s)]
*  decision. And when you're running a half a trillion dollar fund, there is no room for emotion. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3568.4s)]
*  You should not be allowed there should be some so I think that that shows a very hollowed out. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3573.84s)]
*  And at a minimum imbecilic risk management infrastructure at CalPERS that needs to get [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3580.48s)]
*  fixed. So whether the allocation goes up or down, if I was a teacher, and my money was being managed [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3585.76s)]
*  by them, I say man, these people, I would want to understand how they're making decisions. Because I [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3591.1200000000003s)]
*  don't I would want to see the investment memo that got them to decide as an investment committee that [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3597.04s)]
*  1% in the most important asset class that's in your backyard that's making all the money in the [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3603.2s)]
*  world made any sense. I just want to read that memo and see, could I agree with that? Because [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3608.24s)]
*  then I would want to read the investment memo that says we're going to change course and get back to [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3614.64s)]
*  five or 6%. Because if that process isn't fixed, these decisions are just going to be equally bad, [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3621.12s)]
*  you're just going to compound bad on top of bad because again, they clearly did a terrible job. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3627.12s)]
*  And then on top of that, they had horrible partner selection because the people that they [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3633.2s)]
*  did invest in because the data is public have performed horribly. So what changes now all of [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3638.24s)]
*  a sudden, right? Because if the best firms still don't want you in increasing it from 800 million [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3644.56s)]
*  to 5 billion just means you're going to lose 4.2 billion more than you would have otherwise at [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3649.12s)]
*  800 million. Says here they made two bets they had bet on looks like light speed in the last [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3653.2s)]
*  couple years, light speed and TPG. So we'll see how those go. Those can be tough. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3660.32s)]
*  I do have some data on this because we've spent a lot of time talking with them. And as you know, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3666.48s)]
*  Jason, we were just talking, you know, like talking to folks like my bottle of who I, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3671.84s)]
*  California is one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world, right? This is not just a [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3676.7200000000003s)]
*  state. This is bigger than most countries, right? This is one of the biggest economies in the world. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3680.88s)]
*  I would say that what my interactions with the new team have been very impressive. And I will [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3686.08s)]
*  tell you, they're not just looking at funds and building a new portfolio. I think they are thinking [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3692.7999999999997s)]
*  about doubling down at the right time. And they're thinking about thematic bets against super cycles [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3698.3199999999997s)]
*  like AI to say, let's allocate this much money. Who are the three or four deep strategic partnerships [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3703.92s)]
*  that we can have to drive, you know, return on that. So I think it's I think they're on their [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3710.64s)]
*  way. But I agree with you. They're the sovereign wealth fund of the most prolific state in the [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3715.68s)]
*  world. And they should have outsized returns, not trailing returns. I just want to point out [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3721.2s)]
*  one thing here is the power of writing. Chamath, you decided to write your annual letter a couple [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3725.6s)]
*  years ago. Brad, you also will write a letter, famously the Facebook getting fit one or the [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3729.6s)]
*  meta getting fit one, the power of writings. And I just did this for the launch fund for. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3734.96s)]
*  And when you write a deal memo compared to doing a deck, there the questions you get are so [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3740.8s)]
*  qualitatively different. And the people you attract are so different. It is extraordinary. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3747.36s)]
*  I am advising startups across the board to write really tight deal memos, because I write these, [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3752.56s)]
*  we make these deal memos internally, we make an investment. But man, is it great for clarity of [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3757.76s)]
*  thought and for the person on the other side to just stop and read 1000 words or 2000 words, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3762.24s)]
*  as opposed to go through some stupid performative deck. It's just so such a better process. Maybe [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3767.2799999999997s)]
*  you could you both could speak to that or Friedberg. I don't know if you've been writing [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3772.9599999999996s)]
*  deal memos. But maybe for people who are listening or capital allocators and founders, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3775.8399999999997s)]
*  I've been writing for years. Why? And what is the what is it? What does it do for you? Yeah, well, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3779.6s)]
*  it allows you to actually find people who will critique things in a thoughtful, intelligent way. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3786.0s)]
*  It's hard to critique decks because you use broken English, you use fancy graphics, all of [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3791.28s)]
*  a sudden, somebody that's very good at like graphical layout can dupe somebody else. And so [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3796.4s)]
*  you don't get to good outcomes because this weird group think effect sets in when you look at decks. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3801.6800000000003s)]
*  So I'm not a fan of decks, I use them, but they need to be a companion to some sort of long form, [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3807.52s)]
*  narrative document. And I just think it's more useful, you get people who can really think about [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3813.92s)]
*  what they agree about what they don't agree about, it shows the intellect of the person writing it [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3819.9199999999996s)]
*  quite honestly. I just think it's a it's like a basic skill that people should have. It's a useful [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3824.24s)]
*  skill to teach people as well. decks are very dangerous. I think if you're going to make [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3830.48s)]
*  decisions, I would encourage you the bigger the decision. The deck is insufficient, it can be a [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3834.56s)]
*  companion piece, but it needs to be attached to long form documents. But the long form documents [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3840.08s)]
*  don't need to be long either. 2345 pages, but without it, I think you're gonna allow some really [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3844.64s)]
*  bad decisions to creep into some good ones. Freeberg any writing from you? For deals? [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3850.4s)]
*  Okay. He ran, he doesn't talk about writing. All right, as everybody knows, Reddit is on [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3858.16s)]
*  strike right now, or should say the mods who run Reddit are on strike, 95% of reddits went dark, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3864.96s)]
*  they basically turned off new posts, or they just went private, basically, nobody could join, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3870.96s)]
*  nobody could see the content, I believe is what that means, between Monday and Wednesday. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3874.7200000000003s)]
*  And the reason they're doing this is because Reddit decided it would start charging for its API. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3880.88s)]
*  So who gets impacted by using the API? It turns out apps, we saw this at Twitter as well, when [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3885.84s)]
*  Twitter started changing its pricing for its API. And this means that some of the really high end [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3891.2s)]
*  Reddit apps would have to pay $20 million a year for access to Reddit's data. Now, they originally [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3898.8s)]
*  had said they were changing this pricing because they were going to train AI models. And they [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3905.92s)]
*  wanted anybody using that data, i.e. Google Bard or chat GPT-4 and closed AI, they wanted them to [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3910.88s)]
*  pay for it. And Steve Hoffman was explained all this in a New York Times profile in April. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3917.52s)]
*  You can go search for that Reddit wants to get paid for helping to teach big AI systems. The [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3922.2400000000002s)]
*  largest app is called Apollo, just so you know, if you're not into those, Reddit really came out [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3927.04s)]
*  with their app really late. This was a function of the 2005 to 2015 timeframe. Back then, [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3931.52s)]
*  Web 2.0 startups didn't have a lot of capital. So they let other people build on their APIs [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3939.76s)]
*  and build apps. Some of those apps caught steam and are actually better than the apps developed, [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3943.92s)]
*  at least for a while, it was better than the Twitter app and the Reddit app. So [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3948.96s)]
*  thoughts on this free bird? There's a history here [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3953.36s)]
*  is mimicked at both Facebook and Twitter, both of whom had open API's that provided [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3958.56s)]
*  access to third party app developers to build tools on top of the platform by accessing either [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3965.28s)]
*  user data or content off of the network. And then making that available via some different product [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3969.92s)]
*  function, some different UI than the native tools allowed. If you'll remember, Facebook started to [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3976.7999999999997s)]
*  kill off its API, and then the process killed a number of these third party app developers, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3982.08s)]
*  the most prominent of which was Zynga. I think this was around the 2012 timeframe. You guys [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3986.08s)]
*  know if I'm right on that? I think it's right. Sounds right. And you know, we saw the same thing [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3991.3599999999997s)]
*  happen in Twitter, where if you guys remember in the early days, a lot of users accessed [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=3995.12s)]
*  tweets from people that they followed through third party apps and third party apps were [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4001.12s)]
*  competing for the user. And ultimately, Twitter's management team realized that having direct [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4005.68s)]
*  access to the user, being able to control the UI, the UX and not just become a data network, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4011.68s)]
*  but to actually become a service for users made a similar sort of change. So, you know, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4017.9199999999996s)]
*  Reddit's motivation around AI training is an interesting one, but it does speak to this idea [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4024.56s)]
*  that these social network companies social in the sense that the users themselves are creating [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4029.12s)]
*  the value they're creating the content at both Facebook, at Twitter, and at Reddit, ultimately, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4034.32s)]
*  the company loses the value if that data that content gets extracted, and they can't monetize [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4040.7200000000003s)]
*  it or capture the value somehow. And it's a lot different, you know, every company ultimately [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4048.48s)]
*  wants to become a platform company, meaning that they can offer multiple products or services to [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4053.1200000000003s)]
*  users that sit on top of some, you know, network they've created, and in the process create a [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4058.64s)]
*  network effect because more products, more apps creates more users, more users, you know, begats [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4065.7599999999998s)]
*  more apps and so on. That works well in some contexts like an Apple App Store context, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4070.7999999999997s)]
*  but in the context where there is a network unto itself, like Facebook, Twitter and Reddit, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4078.24s)]
*  meaning that there is already a user network that is generating value in the form of the content [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4084.0s)]
*  that's being produced and consumed, you don't necessarily gain anything by then building an [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4088.72s)]
*  app network on top of it. And I think that's been one of the kind of key learnings that's repeated [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4093.28s)]
*  itself over and over with Twitter and Facebook. The thing about Reddit, it's always been a [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4097.84s)]
*  community service. If you guys remember, like in 2014, 2015, Ellen Powell stepped down after there [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4102.56s)]
*  was a Reddit revolt. She was the CEO at the time, and she fired an employee at Reddit that ran the [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4108.32s)]
*  Q&A site for Reddit's mods and their users and the network, the community was super pissed off when [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4114.799999999999s)]
*  this happened and they all revolted and they were going to shut down the service. And ultimately, [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4120.24s)]
*  Ellen, you know, got removed from her role as CEO when this happened. So, you know, because so much [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4124.4s)]
*  of the value of Reddit isn't in the management team, it's not in the work that the software [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4130.639999999999s)]
*  engineers do that run the company. It's not the VCs or the shareholders. The value of Reddit is [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4135.44s)]
*  inherent in the community. It's inherent in the individuals that build the content on that [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4140.48s)]
*  platform. And that community has convened many times in the past at Reddit to change the rules, [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4144.32s)]
*  to say, this is what we want this community to become, and this is how we want this management [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4149.679999999999s)]
*  team to operate. And so it's a really uniquely positioned business. It says a lot about how [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4153.839999999999s)]
*  social networks in this kind of modern era are operating. It really speaks to how much of the [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4159.44s)]
*  value ultimately accrues to the shareholders in a business like this, when the users themselves [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4163.44s)]
*  can step in and unionize and say, hey, you know what, we're not going to allow this much value to [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4167.5199999999995s)]
*  be pulled out of the network in this way. We want this to change. So I think it'll have a lasting [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4171.919999999999s)]
*  effect in terms of investing in social network or social media type businesses where the users [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4176.879999999999s)]
*  are generating so much of the value and have the ability to kind of communicate with one another [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4182.16s)]
*  and control where value ultimately falls. Tramath, you were at Facebook, I think, when Zuckerberg [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4186.16s)]
*  realized enabling a bunch of folks to use the API wasn't as good as controlling the user experience, [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4191.92s)]
*  having a uniform user experience. And it got deprecated. And I remember Zynga and a bunch [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4198.0s)]
*  of other people had games and were sucking users off the platform. There was a LinkedIn [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4204.56s)]
*  competitor at one point that was growing at an incredibly violent pace. And I guess y'all made [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4208.88s)]
*  a decision. We don't want you sucking our user base off the platform. Maybe you could expand [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4214.24s)]
*  on what the decisions were at Facebook at the time. That was one of the things I ran, I think [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4218.8s)]
*  one of my teams was responsible for Facebook platform. Yeah, it was just a very clinical [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4222.8s)]
*  decision around enterprise value. Look, the thing with Reddit is that it's a hot mess. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4228.24s)]
*  And in order to try to create enterprise value, they decided to really leverage [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4234.64s)]
*  the mods so that there was some level of control. And that control was necessary so that they could [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4243.12s)]
*  basically sell ads. That's how this thing moved in lockstep because the minute that there was [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4251.28s)]
*  corporate venture investors and other investors and a need to generate enterprise value, and is [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4255.92s)]
*  it worth 2 billion or 5 billion or 10 billion, whatever the number was that they thought they [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4261.92s)]
*  were worth, they had to make money, right? And Huffman was very straightforward about that. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4265.84s)]
*  And wanting to go public and the whole nine yards. But because it was such a hot mess, [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4270.4s)]
*  the mods became this integral part of the ecosystem so that they could actually drive [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4275.28s)]
*  reasonable revenue. But then what happened was it also allowed them to basically take over. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4281.2s)]
*  And I think that it was a pretty significant miscalculation. Because I think that what they [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4289.5199999999995s)]
*  needed to do was really redefine the economics of how revenue generation splits would work before [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4296.32s)]
*  they could do all of this stuff and try to monetize the API. So I think they got the order of operations [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4302.4s)]
*  wrong. But I also think it's very fixable. And I think that they have some very smart people around [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4307.44s)]
*  that table. So as long as they're, again, willing to be clinical and unemotional like we were, [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4312.32s)]
*  they'll get to the right answer, which is give them a healthy rev share. That's the future. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4317.84s)]
*  Friedberg, you know, what version of what Friedberg said is true, the content creators need to get [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4322.5599999999995s)]
*  paid, you know, why, you know, you see content creators now on YouTube making millions, [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4327.36s)]
*  tens of millions, hundreds of millions, in a few unique cases, billions. And then we are all content [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4332.719999999999s)]
*  creators, yet most of us on these old legacy platforms make nothing. So that exchange has [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4338.639999999999s)]
*  to change. Brad, any thoughts with this derail the IPO? Not on that. But I mean, I think, you know, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4345.04s)]
*  you bring up this thing about meta, you know, did anybody pay attention to, you know, Zots launching [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4349.84s)]
*  Project 92, right? And Project 92 is going to take on Twitter. It's a text based social network [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4356.24s)]
*  that's going to pay creators and they're courting apparently Oprah Winfrey, the Dalai Lama, and all [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4363.84s)]
*  of their creators that are already on their current sites are saying we will use this thing [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4370.08s)]
*  to interact and we will compensate you and then on Lex Friedman's podcast, he mentioned something [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4376.320000000001s)]
*  about, you know, having been inspired a little bit by what was going on with Blue Sky. So I'm [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4381.52s)]
*  super intrigued. You know, he talked about it at this all hands meeting, I think Chris Cox talked [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4389.68s)]
*  about it. So it looks like meta maybe revisiting some of these things that they shelved a while [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4394.16s)]
*  back, you know, doesn't have any direct implications on the Reddit front. But I think [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4398.72s)]
*  there's a suggestion here that it may be more about putting the control back in the hands [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4405.92s)]
*  of the user from a data perspective and a monetization perspective, that would be a [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4412.240000000001s)]
*  pretty gangster move. You know, and an interesting way to leverage the platform. And I don't really [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4417.52s)]
*  hear anybody talking about it. There's a really easy solution here for Reddit. Those mods, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4423.52s)]
*  most of them do it for fame, glory and affiliation community. But if some number of them wanted to [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4430.320000000001s)]
*  monetize their activity there, why not allow people to subscribe to subreddits and pay a membership fee [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4437.040000000001s)]
*  and split it with the mods that that seems like it would be a high scale move getting Patreon, [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4443.120000000001s)]
*  subscription services to let them make a little bit of money. And then with these, [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4449.36s)]
*  it's only three apps that are being affected. They should just either buy those apps and bring [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4453.36s)]
*  those teams internal or I think it's not a lot of revenue with those apps. They could tell those [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4457.5199999999995s)]
*  apps that that's the key issue. It's like, it's like, if you're going to try to monetize API's [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4462.0s)]
*  on user generated content, I think what's happening here is the internet is saying, [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4466.08s)]
*  okay, that's enough, because we're going to leak our activity someplace else where we can directly [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4470.48s)]
*  monetize it. So that's the whole point, I think in this current version of the internet, [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4474.96s)]
*  the value is going to go and again, further, further, further erode away from the centralized [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4479.6s)]
*  apps, and more towards the individual people or in this case, these hubbub spokes, these mods, [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4486.08s)]
*  and not to the centralized organization that that has the housing, the Reddit, the Facebook of the [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4492.64s)]
*  world. So that's just the trend that's happening, the Instagrams of the world. And there's nothing [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4497.84s)]
*  wrong with that. YouTube as well. It's just where the pendulum is swinging. So I think that [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4501.44s)]
*  Reddit just has to cut a medial pretty easy to do. Speaking of AI funding, there was a breaking [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4507.28s)]
*  news story. Just in the last 48 hours, a startup named Mishra AI has raised 105 million seed round, [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4516.4s)]
*  they're calling it should be at about a 240 million valuation, according to reports. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4524.799999999999s)]
*  One of the co founders is a deep mind researcher, I guess people are saying this is insane, [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4531.44s)]
*  because they haven't written any code yet. And they've been working on the company for [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4536.24s)]
*  a couple of why these rounds are so big is I guess that you have to buy all these h 100s. And they're [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4539.599999999999s)]
*  expensive. And these rigs are very expensive. I mean, you guys saw this that Nat Friedman [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4545.04s)]
*  basically published that he spent $75 million on a bunch of hardware. And if you were one of his [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4550.16s)]
*  portfolio companies, you could use it. So getting these h 100s and a 100s to train on seems to be a [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4557.52s)]
*  non trivial task. And so and they're very expensive, even if you can get ahold of them. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4563.4400000000005s)]
*  So I think what we're talking about is basically that these rounds have to go up. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4568.8s)]
*  My and because if you notice, like the post, you have to raise the post, so that it wasn't so [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4573.040000000001s)]
*  utterly dilutive as to completely disincentivize the employees. But let's be honest here, nobody's [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4579.280000000001s)]
*  writing $105 million seat check that 105 million is chopped up probably 10 ways to Sunday. So [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4584.88s)]
*  there's a bunch of people putting in fives and 10s and 15s. I'll just be honest with you in the [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4590.08s)]
*  round. And they said it was massively oversubscribed. Yeah, so I so it's everybody taking a little [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4594.4800000000005s)]
*  teaser bet. The problem with these teaser bets is they never hit in the way that you think maybe [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4600.400000000001s)]
*  you'll get your money back with all the dilution that's going to happen, etc, etc. This is not the [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4604.72s)]
*  way to make money, guys, I'm just going to be honest with you. So whoever's putting money in [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4610.0s)]
*  thinking they know what the fuck they're doing. You might as well just light it on fire, go to [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4613.2s)]
*  Vegas and have some fun with it because you will make more you'll get more enjoyment from that than [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4616.8s)]
*  you will for making these kinds of investors dumb, stupid, stupid bet. Brilliant bet. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4620.5599999999995s)]
*  By the way, this has nothing to do with the company. Nothing to do with the idea. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4627.28s)]
*  I'm saying just talking about when you're embedding 4 million in $105 million round at 240 posts, [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4629.84s)]
*  you do not know what the fuck you're doing. That is not the job. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4635.36s)]
*  So again, Mr. They're gonna be a couple monster rounds, I think announced next week, [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4639.84s)]
*  like that are going to make this one look like kids play. So a lot more of this is coming. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4644.88s)]
*  You're exactly right. This is about buying h 100s and compute everything we're talking about, [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4651.28s)]
*  right. An essential ingredient is compute and it's a scarce resource. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4657.2s)]
*  My god, these people that put the money in the seed round should have just bought Nvidia, [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4660.64s)]
*  buy some call options. Well, and there's downside. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4664.16s)]
*  Has a floor. And by the way, because in just in case Mistral doesn't work, [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4669.2s)]
*  Nvidia will sell those h 100s to somebody else. Yeah, they probably have the option to resell. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4673.28s)]
*  I do think you're right on these teaser bets. This is a power law business. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4678.72s)]
*  There's a massive pressure on young junior partners principles within these firms to do something. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4683.52s)]
*  It's not just teaser bets. What happens in these fire them fire them. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4692.64s)]
*  They want to get the logos because they need to explain to them. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4696.88s)]
*  No, actually, no, that's even worse. The GP that can't manage their fucking principle [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4701.68s)]
*  should be fired. Right. So I should those the young people should shut the fuck up. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4706.16s)]
*  Okay, be lucky you have a job. Learn the craft. It'll take you a decade. And if you are proposing [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4711.84s)]
*  stupid bets like this, again, sizing matters. Again, I'm not talking about the company here. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4718.56s)]
*  I'm just saying when you make a $5 million $3 million deal memo for 105 million dollar round, [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4724.0s)]
*  that is stupid. Okay. And so if you're the partnership that allows those kinds of things [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4730.24s)]
*  to leak through, you don't know what you're doing. So at some point, somebody should be held [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4736.0s)]
*  accountable for this. And I guess what's going to happen is the returns of CalPERS are going to [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4741.6s)]
*  cascade through everybody else thinking, well, at least I own some, you know, h 100s for a minute. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4745.52s)]
*  So let me say, I think this, you want to take the other side, Brad? [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4750.08s)]
*  No, this is just an incredible team that's going to do, you know, that this may turn out to be a [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4753.679999999999s)]
*  fantastic bet, or I don't know, light speed or whoever led this round. Let me let me say [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4758.08s)]
*  something different. In 1997 98, we had a similar phenomenon. Everybody thought internet search was [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4763.36s)]
*  going to be huge. There was massive FOMO and chasing and everybody scrambled to get a search [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4770.08s)]
*  logo. Alta Vista, InfoSea, Lycos, Go, PlanItall, you know, GeoCities, just go through the list, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4775.68s)]
*  you know, that people were scrambling after. And the truth of the matter is almost all those [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4785.4400000000005s)]
*  companies went to zero. Even though you got a couple bets, right? You got the internet right, [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4789.76s)]
*  you got search, right, but you didn't have to invest a dollar in search until 2003. And you [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4795.280000000001s)]
*  would have captured 98, 99%- Do it again. Do it again now for social networking. Same thing. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4800.8s)]
*  Do it again for social networking, Brad. Say all the names. Say all the names. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4805.84s)]
*  It's the same thing. Same thing. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4809.76s)]
*  So, you know, when you when I look at it today, we have a huge anti portfolio for AI. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4812.72s)]
*  It's painful. We've said no to over 60 companies, right? We, you know, but when we look around, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4820.24s)]
*  I see a lot of our competitors doing a lot of these deals. Maybe they're teaser bets. I don't [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4828.4s)]
*  really know the size they're putting into those companies. But I suspect that if we believe this [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4834.639999999999s)]
*  is as big as it's going to be and going to play out over decades, then putting a bunch of really [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4839.919999999999s)]
*  small bets in order to buy a network or buy relationships or buy logos, etc. I don't think [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4845.599999999999s)]
*  it's going to work any better this time than it worked then around social networking. But to be [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4850.96s)]
*  clear, there are going to be some people who lead these deals who help these companies build [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4856.08s)]
*  incredible businesses. And those will, you know, there are going to be some winners here. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4860.48s)]
*  I think there's time to participate in the winners. Right now, a lot of this is unknown [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4864.8s)]
*  and unknowable. It will become more clear in the one, two, three years ahead. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4870.0s)]
*  The problem is for the LPs, like if you are the LP, I am an LP and a bunch of venture funds, [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4874.88s)]
*  this stuff really turns my stomach because I'm like, wow, I am losing money every day. When I [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4879.44s)]
*  see these things, that's why I get so emotional about this. I think to myself, if the GPS that [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4884.48s)]
*  I've given money to are doing these kinds of deals, I'm screwed. At best, maybe I'll get back 50 or 60 [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4889.679999999999s)]
*  cents on the dollar. And I immediately start thinking to myself, I really need to write this [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4896.5599999999995s)]
*  down. And I'm re underwriting that person and that organization, because I'm wondering, how can you [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4900.719999999999s)]
*  let these things happen? Because if you just look back in history, you have to be really, really [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4905.5199999999995s)]
*  negligent to not learn that these things never work out the way that you think they are. And [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4911.52s)]
*  especially these kinds of rounds and this nominal ownership, the inability to defend ownership, [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4916.320000000001s)]
*  it's just not a path to success. I mean, also, if you think about this, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4921.200000000001s)]
*  Chema, you know, what company in recent history that got overfunded actually use that money, [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4924.96s)]
*  logically, the magic of Silicon Valley is the milestone based funding system. And whenever you [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4930.4800000000005s)]
*  short circuit that this money becomes a huge distraction to founders. If they were to receive [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4935.6s)]
*  10 million 25 million work for a year or two, then raise another 25 or 50 million, they don't [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4941.12s)]
*  need to raise all this money at once. This is like taking your ABC round, putting it all in 100%. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4946.32s)]
*  And all it does is distract founders. And then everybody coming for a salary says, well, you [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4951.12s)]
*  got 105 million in the bank, I want $3 million, I want $5 million. What's the best example guys [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4954.88s)]
*  of a huge financial winner that raised these ginormous amounts of money? What's the best [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4960.32s)]
*  example pre launch of a product? There's no product here. What's the best example? Magic leap. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4964.96s)]
*  I have what is it? Oh, of disasters that actually Oh, no, no. What is the best example of a great [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4970.88s)]
*  company quote, I'm putting quotes that raise these kinds of amounts so early in the cycle? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4977.4400000000005s)]
*  Quibi. No, Brad, do you have an example? What's made money? There are people who raised a lot [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4982.8s)]
*  of money over the lifecycle like an Uber. No, no, I'm not talking about that. We're talking three [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4989.6s)]
*  rounds at once. What was your first seat check into Uber? What was the total seed rank? I can [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4994.4800000000005s)]
*  tell you what Facebook's was. It was $500,000. It was 1.25. I think. Okay, Facebook's was $500,000. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=4999.28s)]
*  We need a lot of money later. We needed a lot of money later. But no, it's 5 million. Sorry, [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5008.16s)]
*  500,000 safe at five, five. Here's another $5 million valuation for Uber 1.25. I think when [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5013.5199999999995s)]
*  it here's another thing, everybody walks in, they say, well, I have to raise this much money. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5018.96s)]
*  And it's good. This is a circular logic. I have to raise this money because I have to have all this [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5023.68s)]
*  compute. And I say, well, okay, you got to train it. You know, we want to have a vertically [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5031.12s)]
*  integrated model, we want to train them on this. Okay. So there's a huge upfront cost. And they're [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5035.6s)]
*  like, but I don't want to take a lot of dilution. So I have to raise it at a really high price. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5040.400000000001s)]
*  And so you say, okay, well, that's, that's a challenge for you, not necessarily a good [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5046.08s)]
*  thing for us. And then they say, oh, and if you ask the question, is this an ongoing expense, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5051.12s)]
*  they're like, oh, yeah, we're gonna have to retrain, like, we're gonna have to continue [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5056.24s)]
*  to spend this money. And I'm like, well, so if you're a software company, for example, [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5059.04s)]
*  and you say, well, what's my cogs, if all of a sudden you have an embedded cogs, [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5064.96s)]
*  that's massive and recurring, right? For your compute costs that we haven't had in the past, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5069.92s)]
*  then the revenue on the other side of that's got to be a multiple of what a traditional [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5076.4s)]
*  software company might have in order to get back to that set of economics. So I think there's this, [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5081.12s)]
*  there's a scramble and understandably so if you think the big win AGI or, you know, this autonomous [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5087.76s)]
*  agent that's going to, you know, be the top of the next funnel, that thing is going to be worth a lot. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5094.08s)]
*  But to me, those are lottery tickets at this at this stage. Can I tell you a little secret? [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5101.36s)]
*  Here's a little secret. When you put in $100 million into a startup to buy compute, [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5106.72s)]
*  you are not buying whiz bang next generation IP, you are subsidizing capex. And that is a job [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5114.96s)]
*  that many, many other people do at a very low hurdle rate. And so it is a law of capitalism [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5124.64s)]
*  that it could be the most incredibly innovative company in the world. But if you are offering [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5133.28s)]
*  money to them to fulfill a low yield thing, you are just not going to make a lot of money. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5138.639999999999s)]
*  When you put money into a startup that is their writing code to build groundbreaking IP, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5148.48s)]
*  writing code to build groundbreaking IP, you own something that's really real. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5154.88s)]
*  But that's because 80 cents on the dollar is going to core critical R&D in that point in time. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5161.28s)]
*  And then they raise a lot of money at a lot less dilution when 80 cents on the dollar goes to sales [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5167.04s)]
*  and marketing, then they raise a lot of even more money at an even smaller, smaller amount of [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5171.84s)]
*  dilution, you start to get to scale internationally. So you start to see right more dollars, less return, [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5176.16s)]
*  right, you're owning less of the critical differentiation. So if everybody is like, [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5183.04s)]
*  oh, it's so expensive for compute, I need to raise 100 million. Well, buddy, you know, that's like a [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5188.96s)]
*  leasing function. You know, you're like, all of a sudden, like the best VCs in the world have become [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5194.320000000001s)]
*  like Comerica bank. Yeah. I mean, they could have done it with the same structure, right? Comerica [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5200.4800000000005s)]
*  could have given them 50 million to buy these machines. And maybe they should. And Comerica [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5205.52s)]
*  and JP Morgan and somebody else should basically say, Hey, you know what, here's a lease line for [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5209.44s)]
*  your H 100s. Because I know they're worth so much. And I'll just guess right at 10%. And and my point [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5213.04s)]
*  is that the fact that people don't understand this is why the money will get torched. I would love a [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5219.28s)]
*  critique that says actually, Chamath, you're an idiot. I'm right. I know that that's happening. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5224.08s)]
*  But here's why I still see it happening. I don't hear any of that. Here's the problem with that [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5228.16s)]
*  critique. Okay, so you asked like, what are the biggest projects in history, you know, around [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5231.919999999999s)]
*  startups think about AWS, I don't know, they spent 400 million probably, in order to get AWS off the [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5237.28s)]
*  ground, but it wasn't done by a startup, right? You think about what Zuck spending on the metaverse, [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5242.8s)]
*  it's not being done right by a startup. The truth of the matter is the high. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5248.16s)]
*  Sorry, can you go back to a P AWS AWS was dog fooded on Amazon retail? [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5252.24s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5257.2s)]
*  And Oculus was done on Kickstarter, and the cash flow of Amazon retail, [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5258.4s)]
*  development of AWS? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5262.88s)]
*  Correct. My point is that when you think about what these hyperscalers are going to do, they're not [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5264.08s)]
*  going to spend a billion, they're not gonna spend 10 billion, they'll spend $100 billion, right, [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5270.16s)]
*  in order to be in this race. And so if you're backing a startup that says I'm going to build [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5274.88s)]
*  a better chat GPT, right, just like OpenAI discovered themselves, they sold 51% or 50% [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5281.599999999999s)]
*  of the company to Microsoft for a reason. They had to they had to have the data and they had [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5288.4s)]
*  to have the compute. This is a nuclear arms race around compute. And so but I think it's [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5292.96s)]
*  this is insane. It's financially illiterate. For someone to think that they are actually doing [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5298.719999999999s)]
*  anything other than subsidizing capex when you're giving $100 million to a startup to literally buy [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5304.4s)]
*  chips and servers and rack and stack up 40% of their equity. That's the other thing this equity [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5311.28s)]
*  is so valuable. Why would you want to give 40% of it when you could get an equipment lease? [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5316.0s)]
*  And keep it okay. You can't get those. You can't get it. I mean, if the VCs put in 50 million [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5319.68s)]
*  instead of 105, you don't think co America would come on the back end with 25 million? Of course, [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5326.24s)]
*  they would. Brad is right. This happened in 98 99 2000, where all of this money was getting flushed [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5330.16s)]
*  down the drain going into buying data center capacity where remember even at Facebook, like [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5336.16s)]
*  we were racking and stacking our own servers. And then we then we ultimately got big enough where [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5340.4s)]
*  we actually built out our East Coast and West Coast data centers and data centers all around [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5345.52s)]
*  the world. But it was very expensive. And in that moment, again, all of those companies just lit all [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5348.64s)]
*  that money on fire. If they torched it, there was no remnant equity value for that capital. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5355.040000000001s)]
*  And so I guess I guess I'm just I'm just questioning like, what does a GP think they're [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5361.52s)]
*  actually buying? Well, 80% of 80% of it's going to hardware. I mean, they're buying the other 20% [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5366.56s)]
*  buying chips. I mean, it doesn't make sense. And that's going to get [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5373.52s)]
*  obsolete. I want to make one point here. And free break. I want to get your input on this as well. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5377.52s)]
*  constraint is important for founders. And the thing that I find really troubling about this is [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5382.8s)]
*  and putting this startup aside, because crypto people also went through this for the last three [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5387.92s)]
*  four years where they were overfunded. How did that turn out? It was 10s of billions of dollars [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5391.76s)]
*  burnt of LP monies, people's retirements, and college endowments. And it's going to be quite [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5396.72s)]
*  a postmortem. But look at you invoked meta. It's important for people who don't know this, [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5401.76s)]
*  to know that that was a Kickstarter. Shout out to Palmer Lucky. He raised a couple of million [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5407.4400000000005s)]
*  dollars in 2011. I think it was on a Kickstarter pre selling the devices right constraint makes for [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5413.92s)]
*  great art constraint makes for great startups, you need to have pressure on a startup for them [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5421.4400000000005s)]
*  to deliver you cannot give startups five years of runway and expect it's going to work. It just [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5426.8s)]
*  doesn't work. And never seen this movie so many times. But now we've gone through 18 months of [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5432.88s)]
*  nobody doing anything, I guess, in VC land. So folks on San Francisco are itchy. They want to [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5437.28s)]
*  justify why they should still be drawing 2% on the full fund. They want to try to show activity so [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5442.88s)]
*  that they can raise the next fund and continue to stack fees. And all of these sort of leads to [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5449.04s)]
*  the suspension of financial logic, but it gets replaced with financial illiteracy, [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5454.08s)]
*  which is really there's an optimal fund size right your mouth. And this is why the people that pay [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5459.2s)]
*  the price are ultimately the LPs. And it may be the case that CalPERS maybe actually avoids a [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5462.72s)]
*  lot of these pitfalls because by missing Yeah, they missed all the returns. But then they missed [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5467.68s)]
*  writing the mega follow on checks for all of these folks that they and then they would have torched [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5472.24s)]
*  Okay, I'm gonna take the other side of that. Go ahead, Brett. I think it's nearly impossible [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5476.96s)]
*  to conceive that all of these bets that are currently being made are bad bets. I think it's [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5481.76s)]
*  a major platform disruption. But I, you know, instead, I think the right way to think about it [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5486.320000000001s)]
*  is it's about pacing. And if you're trying to, if everybody thinks they're going to build the next [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5492.72s)]
*  Google, they're going to build the next autonomous agent that's going to sit on top of the funnel, [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5498.56s)]
*  that's going to be worth a trillion, and therefore they can burn a billion dollars training models, [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5502.96s)]
*  that's not like we're not going to have 10 of those winners. Okay. But at the same time, [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5507.52s)]
*  there's a lot of stuff getting funded that is in the application layer that is in the tool layer. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5513.200000000001s)]
*  And these are not the big headlines that you're reading about. But these are really interesting [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5519.120000000001s)]
*  businesses that are solving real problems in the software and tooling layer here. You know, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5524.56s)]
*  in the smaller model layer, vertically oriented things around life sciences or, you know, targeting [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5530.4800000000005s)]
*  financial services, or things in the application layer, you know, like character.ai, etc. So I do [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5538.0s)]
*  think there are a lot of good things getting funded that will deliver real value. But I agree [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5545.36s)]
*  with you the problem that there's a there's a second problem to this Chamath, if you drop a billion or [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5550.96s)]
*  2 billion, or 3 billion into something, you have not only a product challenge, you have a distribution [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5555.92s)]
*  challenge, right? We know all the hyper scalers are going to play Google is going to play meta is [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5564.4s)]
*  going to play. And so you've got to compete and then beat them. And it used to be that you would [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5570.5599999999995s)]
*  say, well, if I get a lot of traction, they'll buy me if I'm Instagram or WhatsApp, like they'll buy [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5576.16s)]
*  me. Well, we have such a regulatory nightmare in Washington DC today. No hyper scaler can spend [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5580.24s)]
*  over $1 billion to buy any AI company, not even that 400 million gifts. What is it Giffey? [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5588.96s)]
*  Unfortunately, in the United States today, we replace mergers and acquisition, [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5596.08s)]
*  right with copy and compete. Because we've said to hyper scalers, you're not allowed [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5600.88s)]
*  to acquire any of these companies. So the unintended consequence of the regulation in Washington [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5607.76s)]
*  is that entrepreneurs and founders and venture capitalists who might otherwise have had a good [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5614.16s)]
*  idea built something with some traction, they can't find a home for it in the way, you know, [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5619.76s)]
*  that WhatsApp found a home or isn't that a good thing? Is that a good thing? Is it better for [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5625.12s)]
*  the market presupposes that everything can become a big and profitable business there? [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5633.36s)]
*  Netnet can become a big and profitable business now, on its own, no chance. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5638.639999999999s)]
*  Well, it's still not a big and profitable business. Okay, so that's what I'm saying. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5645.44s)]
*  So maybe it should have died. I mean, maybe it's been kept alive. But I mean, it's [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5649.12s)]
*  actually don't you think it's better for the market? I think it's great. It got it. It was [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5652.4s)]
*  innovative technology was it, you know, you were able to back it with some good funding. And I [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5656.88s)]
*  think what's coming is going to be really exciting. But it took a really long runway, a lot of capital [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5662.88s)]
*  a lot of intelligence in order to build. Unfortunately, we've killed that. So you [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5668.08s)]
*  have a two sided problem. We're spending more than ever to fund and start these companies. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5672.24s)]
*  And we, you know, have undermined a lot of the downside protection. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5677.28s)]
*  Freeberg, your thoughts. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5681.04s)]
*  So if you look at how the capital is being deployed, if it's mostly being deployed to [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5682.64s)]
*  train models, then the question has to be, is there really a sustainable advantage that arises [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5686.48s)]
*  by being the first to train the models, and then being able to persist in advantage by training new [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5694.0s)]
*  models from that foundational model going forward. And the reason that that matters so much is because [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5699.2s)]
*  you have to really have a deep understanding if you're going to invest a lot of capital here, [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5705.2s)]
*  you have to have a deep understanding for how quickly model development and training is [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5710.0s)]
*  accelerating and how quickly the costs are reducing. So something that costs like we said, [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5715.04s)]
*  OpenAI spent $400 million training models for GPT-4. If they spent $400 million in the last [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5720.08s)]
*  couple of years, you could probably assume that doing the same training exercise could be done for [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5726.32s)]
*  five to $10 million 18 months from now to generate the same model. That's a, you know, 100x cost [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5732.0s)]
*  reduction. And I'm just ballparking it here. But if that's really where things are headed, [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5738.5599999999995s)]
*  then does the $100 million to train models today really make sense if training those same models [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5744.16s)]
*  can be done for $5 million in 18 to 24 months? And that's where it becomes a really difficult [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5749.6s)]
*  investment exercise. And one that you have to really critically understand how cost curves are [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5755.120000000001s)]
*  moving in AI. The same thing was true in DNA sequencing in the early days. And it's following, [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5759.6s)]
*  by the way, a similar cost curve is DNA sequencing, which is actually greater than Moore's law, [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5764.0s)]
*  greater than a 2x cost reduction every 18 months. We're seeing something much greater than that in [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5768.64s)]
*  machine learning right now, in terms of cost reduction and model training. So ultimately, [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5774.160000000001s)]
*  the business model has to have some advantage that by being the first to market, you can then [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5778.56s)]
*  generate new data that gives you a persisting advantage and no one can catch up with you. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5784.160000000001s)]
*  And my guess is if you get under the hood of the business models, it's unlikely going to be the [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5787.84s)]
*  case. And it's very likely going to be the case that you don't know when the market advantage will [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5792.400000000001s)]
*  lie when you will be able to kind of create a persisting mode, a mode that expands as you [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5798.080000000001s)]
*  get more data and can train more. And this is why it's so hard to invest generally in technology [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5802.080000000001s)]
*  is because you don't know the point at which the market tips relative to the point at which [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5807.84s)]
*  the technology tips. So there's a moment where the technology gets so cheap. And then the market [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5812.400000000001s)]
*  maybe adopts after the technology gets cheap. And at that point, it's a totally different game. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5817.92s)]
*  Remember in the mid 2000s, where we had memory shortages, and we used to have to buy RAM? [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5822.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's just like it's all this stuff. And it's like if VCs are funding this stuff, [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5827.04s)]
*  just you just like like the equity on fire, guys, not going to be worth anything. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5831.2s)]
*  Brad's point is right, which is the question is what's possible now? Where can you build a [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5835.68s)]
*  sustaining advantage now? Rather than go after big model development cycles, where the cost curve is [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5840.64s)]
*  going to come down by 100 fold in some period of time in the near future? Is there a business model [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5845.76s)]
*  advantage you can build by being in the market first building a customer base, accelerating your [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5851.360000000001s)]
*  features, getting user feedback, and that certainly exists in the application and the tools layer as [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5856.240000000001s)]
*  Brad is talking about? That seems like such a no brainer for disruption across many different [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5861.04s)]
*  segments, many different verticals, many different markets right now. Versus trying to compete further [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5866.48s)]
*  down the stack, where it takes hundreds of millions of dollars of capital. And in a couple of months, [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5872.08s)]
*  that hundred millions of dollars of capital can be replaced with 5 million bucks of training [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5876.72s)]
*  exercise and compute. Can I take the other side of that? Yeah, all that coordination makes no money [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5880.48s)]
*  today. So to your point, when you cut the actual input cost by 100 fold, the coordination costs [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5884.8s)]
*  goes from being zero to being worth less than zero. Right? I don't see any money being made [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5890.88s)]
*  there either. And all the people that say, I'm sure there's going to be some genius in the comments. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5895.28s)]
*  But what about open source? And it's like, what about it? Open AI also just gave an update on [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5899.04s)]
*  their cost structure for their API. And they just dropped it 25 to 75%. Again, this is after the 10 [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5905.2s)]
*  fold drop they did last year. Play this out. $100 million of capital spent training today is a [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5911.6s)]
*  million dollars spent doing training in a few years. Yeah, three years, 18, 18 to 36 months, [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5916.72s)]
*  somewhere in that timeframe is likely the timeframe. So why would you spend all this money today when [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5922.240000000001s)]
*  an 18 to 24 month things are gonna get so much cheaper? I think the further up the value stack [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5926.64s)]
*  you go, the more of an opportunity to truly kind of innovate, disrupt and make capital as possible. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5931.280000000001s)]
*  What happens in 24 months, so when you've made a bunch of hundred million dollar investments, [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5937.04s)]
*  and they're all zeros? You get fired? [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5940.64s)]
*  Maybe? Unfortunately, as an investor, Chamath, is that what you're asking? [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5947.6s)]
*  At some point, you don't get invited to join the next fund. Think about the alternative investment [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5951.4400000000005s)]
*  strategy with lots of capital, where the cost curve is not coming down as quickly in terms of [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5956.96s)]
*  where that capital is being deployed. For example, building rockets to go to space or building [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5961.68s)]
*  infrastructure to transport power or building roads. You could raise a billion dollars to build [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5967.68s)]
*  a whole booth system or a port. Let's use a port. A shipping port is a good example. You could spend [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5973.4400000000005s)]
*  a billion dollars to build a shipping port. It's not that the cost of building a shipping port is [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5978.96s)]
*  going to come down by 10x in 18 months. So it makes sense to raise a billion dollars and build a freaking [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5983.4400000000005s)]
*  shipping port and charge people to come out. VCs thought they were underwriting IP and said they're [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5989.6s)]
*  just actually subsidizing catbacks. It's the craziest thing. It's the craziest thing. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5995.2s)]
*  Brad, is this a problem of the optimal venture fund size that Fred Wilson talks about that Bill [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=5999.04s)]
*  Gurley talks about? A lot of the OGs say, hey, 250, 400, 600 million, there's an optimal size [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6004.96s)]
*  here for four or five partners in a venture fund to put money to work. Is this part of the problem [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6011.679999999999s)]
*  right now, which also happened in crypto, is you had billion dollar, two billion dollar funds sitting [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6016.0s)]
*  around and different venture brand names having four or five of these multi-billion dollar funds [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6020.48s)]
*  burning a hole in their pocket and getting frisky over this 18 month pause? Is this about optimal [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6026.4s)]
*  fund size making bad bets? We have over a billion dollar fund. So if I take the other side of that, [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6033.36s)]
*  the people are going to say you're talking your book, but I don't think this is about large funds. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6041.12s)]
*  I think this is about good and bad decisions. At the end of the day, [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6046.4800000000005s)]
*  some of these decisions will pay off. Like for example, what's the largest bet size from a [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6050.16s)]

*  dollars most likely. But we may cross it over other funds and have bigger bets. Certainly, [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6060.72s)]
*  would that happen two or three times though? Would you do it all at once like this or might it happen [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6067.92s)]
*  over a series A, B, C kind of situation where you build a position? [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6072.08s)]
*  Well, I would say we're not writing, we haven't written a hundred million dollar check into a [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6075.28s)]
*  series A. And I don't think most of people, to Chema's point that you're talking about, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6080.96s)]
*  are writing a hundred million dollar checks into those series A's. The Mistral round that [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6084.5599999999995s)]
*  you referenced, I imagine the lead check into that was maybe 50, maybe 50. So listen, larger [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6088.4s)]
*  fund sizes enable you to participate in companies that require more capital. And these companies do [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6095.04s)]
*  require more capital. So you may take the position that all these companies are going to zero. That's [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6103.84s)]
*  not my position. My position simply is that I do believe there is a bit of over-exuberance [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6109.12s)]
*  that too many things are getting funded. And that's like the margin of safety, the margin [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6116.88s)]
*  of return being required is probably lower than it should be. But there's no doubt out of this [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6125.44s)]
*  vintage in my mind that you're going to have some epic companies. Now, I don't know if what Mustafa [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6131.6s)]
*  and Reid Hoffman are doing at Inflection is building pie to take on Chet GPT and to take on [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6136.64s)]
*  BART and to be the intelligent assistant. The ambition is extraordinary. The cost of compute is [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6143.68s)]
*  high. But the first mover advantage is also high. Because whoever secures this position, [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6149.92s)]
*  Bill Gates said he's been playing around with it. It's one of his favorite agents or whatever. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6157.68s)]
*  That's an interesting comment. I think it's pretty good. But I think Chet GPT is out in front in this [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6161.92s)]
*  regard. I think a lot of people are going to try to compete for that space. But I can't imagine that [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6167.04s)]
*  all of these researchers leaving deep mind are going to be able to compete for the most sophisticated [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6172.96s)]
*  model to answer general purpose questions. So I don't think it's the large fund size. I think [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6179.2s)]
*  it's just a lot of exuberance to participate in what everybody perceives to be a massive platform [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6184.32s)]
*  disruption. I think that can be true, just like the internet was in 1997. And a lot of these bets [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6190.88s)]
*  can, can and will likely go to zero. How great is America, you just rent other people's money, [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6197.28s)]
*  they pay you 2% and then you're allowed to get exuberant yet keep your job when you lose it. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6202.4s)]
*  God bless America. Well, I mean, the the issue trim off is it takes 10 years to prove you're bad [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6207.2s)]
*  at this job. For now, no, no, no, it takes 10 years to prove you're good. And it takes 20 to prove [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6214.08s)]
*  to prove that you can be consistently good and didn't get lucky. But it didn't a few years, [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6221.36s)]
*  you can tell that somebody sucks. Can LPs tell? Well, I'm not sure that they get the visibility [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6226.48s)]
*  because when LPs interact with GPS, they're grin fucked for the most part. So I don't know, [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6233.36s)]
*  probably not. But when I interact with them, just as a peer to peer level, and I see the deals I [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6239.2s)]
*  could done, it's pretty easy to understand that some people just suck. They don't know how to make [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6245.44s)]
*  money, I guess is the point, which in the job, that's the job is to make money to consistently [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6249.599999999999s)]
*  make money. Okay, Brad, take care. And let's go to science corner. Bill Gates wants to genetically [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6255.2s)]
*  modify mosquitoes. Is this news or real? Incorrect fake news. It's fake news. Okay. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6261.2s)]
*  Explain the reference is from RFK jr. tweet that he sent out where he retweeted someone talking [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6268.8s)]
*  about this mosquito factory in Colombia. And this guy basically put out a tweet saying, Oh, look, [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6275.44s)]
*  Bill Gates has a mosquito factory in Colombia. It's the largest in the world 30 million genetically [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6283.679999999999s)]
*  modified mosquitoes are released every week into 11 countries. Because Bill knows better than nature [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6287.92s)]
*  what could possibly go wrong. RFK jr. then took it upon himself to retweet and say, should Bill [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6293.04s)]
*  Gates be releasing 30 million genetically modified mosquitoes into the wild? Part of the mentality [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6298.8s)]
*  of earth as engineering object, what could possibly go wrong? So I really wanted to take issue with [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6303.4400000000005s)]
*  this. Because I do think that this is the sort of misinformation that both creates scientific illiteracy [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6309.04s)]
*  and damages and impacts negatively some of the significant progress that can be made in medicine [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6317.04s)]
*  and in science. So I want to speak very clearly as to what is going on, what the science is behind it, [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6323.68s)]
*  why this is super important. And then we can speak philosophically if you guys are interested on kind [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6328.96s)]
*  of should we be doing this sort of stuff and why so what's real here? Like what what are actual [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6333.92s)]
*  facts versus fake news? Maybe that's a good place to start the most common disease carrying mosquitoes [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6338.72s)]
*  are called Edis a gypte. It's a species of mosquito that carry yellow fever, dengue, [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6343.44s)]
*  Zika, a number of viruses that obviously are pretty adverse to human health. Each year about [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6353.599999999999s)]
*  400 million people are infected with dengue virus via this mosquito vector, 100 million become ill, [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6360.48s)]
*  and 21,000 deaths are attributed to dengue. Globally 200,000 cases of yellow fever each [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6367.36s)]
*  year causing 30,000 deaths. These are pretty significant health concerns. And it turns out [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6372.4s)]
*  that in mosquito populations, not in this particular species that carry these viruses, [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6378.0s)]
*  but in other species of mosquito, there's a bacteria, a natural bacteria called Wolbachia. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6382.719999999999s)]
*  And this bacteria exists in nature. And sometimes these mosquitoes get infected with this bacteria. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6388.32s)]
*  So they carry this this this bacterial bug. And this bacteria is really interesting because it [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6393.2s)]
*  causes what's called cytoplasmic instability in the mosquito cells, which actually makes the [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6398.4s)]
*  mosquito largely resistant to a lot of viruses. And there's a bunch of theories for this mechanism [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6403.599999999999s)]
*  and why this is the case. But it causes the mosquito to not be able to carry and spread [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6409.04s)]
*  these viruses that are super adverse to human health. So number one, there's a natural bacteria [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6414.5599999999995s)]
*  that's found in nature and up to 40% of mosquitoes are already infected with it. Number two is it's [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6419.5199999999995s)]
*  not common in the mosquito species that is common in these areas that are spreading these awful [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6425.36s)]
*  viruses to humans. And so there's been a project that's been going on now for 12 plus years, [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6430.48s)]
*  where they're taking large amounts of mosquitoes and breeding them specifically to have this [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6437.2s)]
*  bacteria in the mosquitoes. And then they release those mosquitoes into the wild. And over time, [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6442.0s)]
*  the bacterial infected mosquitoes start to become a larger percentage of the population. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6448.0s)]
*  And as a result, the vector of carrying these awful viruses into humans goes way down. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6452.24s)]
*  There was a study done in Indonesia where they took these Wolbachia infected mosquitoes, [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6457.92s)]
*  and they released them into the wild. And they looked at a population that was in a region where [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6462.8s)]
*  they released them in a population that they didn't. In the region where they didn't release [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6466.5599999999995s)]
*  them, 9.4% of people ended up getting infected with dengue fever. And where they did release them, [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6470.96s)]
*  only 2.3% were infected. So it was an amazing 75% reduction in the infection of people by these [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6477.84s)]
*  mosquitoes. And so the whole point is just to kind of move the mosquito populations in a way [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6485.84s)]
*  without doing any sort of genetic modification, but by exposing them to this bacteria so that [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6491.4400000000005s)]
*  they don't carry these viruses into people. But because people don't- [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6495.92s)]
*  So that's a nuanced point there, Friedberg. It's not genetic modification or it is? [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6499.6s)]
*  It's not. I just explained it's a bacteria. And they just expose the mosquitoes. So they end up [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6504.88s)]
*  getting infected with this bacteria. And then as they breed, the mosquitoes breed in this facility. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6510.4s)]
*  You have to have an infected male and an infected female for the offspring to have the bacteria. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6515.76s)]
*  If you have an infected male, they're actually infertile. They can only fertilize an infected [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6521.12s)]
*  female. So unless you do this breeding work, you don't end up seeing this happen naturally [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6526.16s)]
*  in the environment where the Wolbachia starts to spread widely. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6530.88s)]
*  Where is the genetic modification misinformation coming from? [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6533.28s)]
*  Or is that also occurring? [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6537.36s)]
*  From the presidential candidate, RFK Jr., who just propagated it. And so this is why I want [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6539.04s)]
*  to make this point. Because this whole idea that, oh, should we be engineering the earth? Let me [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6543.52s)]
*  just say something about engineering the earth. Humans used to wander around the earth, or [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6547.4400000000005s)]
*  proto-humans did, without access to food. And until we realized that we could plant a seed in the [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6552.56s)]
*  ground and grow crops and started to engineer the earth in the form of farming, we did not have [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6557.92s)]
*  access to a reliable source of calories. Human ingenuity, human engineering gave us the ability [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6563.12s)]
*  to do this, gave us the ability to feed ourselves. Similarly, humans got infected by viruses, by [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6568.16s)]
*  bacteria, by fungus, and died at a young age over and over again. And when humans began to engineer [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6573.68s)]
*  medicine and engineer unnatural substances, because he makes this point, oh, should we be [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6579.84s)]
*  interfering in the natural world? What is natural is for people to get infected with viruses or [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6585.12s)]
*  bacteria and die. And if not for the advent of our engineering and our ingenuity and our ability [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6589.76s)]
*  as a species to create solutions through science, which allows us to do discovery, and then through [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6594.96s)]
*  engineering, which allows us to make solutions that solve problems that humans face, we would [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6600.48s)]
*  all be dead at a young age and we would not have realized the progress that we've had as a species. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6605.68s)]
*  So I really get ticked off when I see guys like RFK Jr. and others, not just propagate this, [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6610.0s)]
*  this BS misinformation spiel about, oh, genetically modified this and that science is bad, but to then [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6616.64s)]
*  say, should we be messing with the natural world? Because I would say to him, what about when your [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6623.12s)]
*  kid got infected, and you gave your kid antibiotics, maybe you shouldn't have done that. And this [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6626.32s)]
*  notion that- And there is a group of people who are saying that you shouldn't do that, right? There is a movement to [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6630.64s)]
*  stop taking antibiotics because it's making, because it's having an- [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6634.8s)]
*  I'll tell you a couple of things. There are bad pesticides that impact human health and cause [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6639.4400000000005s)]
*  damage to our DNA. There is bad sunscreen that is endocrine disruptors and can damage human health. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6645.2s)]
*  There are plenty of chemical products that are made that we use in everyday products that cause [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6651.12s)]
*  cancer. There is an endless string of things that are wrong with the systems of engineering that we [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6655.52s)]
*  do use. That doesn't mean that they're all bad. That doesn't mean that we then say, hey, you know what, [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6662.32s)]
*  let's not do anything. Let's not do any engineering. Let's not use any antibiotics. Let's not use any [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6668.0s)]
*  technology in food. And that's the challenge is getting into the details on- I'll tell you, [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6672.96s)]
*  I don't use any sunscreen products with myself or my kids. I only use zinc. And I have a similar [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6678.4s)]
*  sort of nuanced approach to understanding what things we should or shouldn't use in our lives [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6683.5199999999995s)]
*  because of the data on the side of- Pause, pause, pause, pause. Can you please explain that? Because [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6687.5199999999995s)]
*  I didn't know this. What am I doing? Am I getting- What? Explain. Yeah. So there's a number of [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6691.919999999999s)]
*  substances which are known endocrine disruptors that are found in sunscreen. I think it's like [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6697.599999999999s)]
*  one of the craziest things that we haven't made these products illegal at this point. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6703.28s)]
*  But the only sunscreen that you should use is natural mineral sunscreen. Sorry, I shouldn't say [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6708.16s)]
*  that you should. I should say this is what I choose to do based on the data that I've seen. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6713.28s)]
*  What's a good brand? What brand? Any brand that's just zinc sunscreen. Just look at the back. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6717.44s)]
*  If there's anything but zinc in it, don't use it. Zinc oxide? Is that what it's referred to? [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6722.16s)]
*  Yes, zinc oxide. Totally. Exactly. Zinc oxide sunscreen? Yeah. Well, that's the ingredient in it. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6725.84s)]
*  So I don't know what you guys- Huh, wow. But here, let me just send you this. Are you saying that [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6735.44s)]
*  you're not allowed to have any other ingredient? There's no stabilizers, there's nothing else? [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6741.28s)]
*  No, no. It's the stuff that- The principle ingredient has to be zinc oxide versus some [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6745.5199999999995s)]
*  other chemical, you're saying? Yeah. So oxybenzone. I don't use any products with oxybenzone. That's [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6750.8s)]
*  like the most common sunscreen ingredient. Tinoxide is the other one. Homosalate and the [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6756.48s)]
*  parabens. All of those product categories, which are the most common products used in sunscreen, [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6761.759999999999s)]
*  they're absorbed by your skin. They go into your bloodstream and they're endocrine disruptors. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6767.12s)]
*  The problem with the zinc sunscreen and the mineral sunscreen is it actually stays on your skin, [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6771.04s)]
*  so you look like you're wearing it. It's really hard to rub it in. You got to really, really rub [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6775.2s)]
*  it in. They're actually not popular from a cosmetic point of view. People don't like wearing them [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6778.4800000000005s)]
*  because they look like idiots and it's really hard to rub them in. Yeah, that's the stuff I use in [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6783.2s)]
*  the summer, the IsDin. It drives me crazy because I look like this weird, shiny ghost thing. I know. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6787.28s)]
*  But I do use that. Nat's really hardcore about that stuff. That's an example of understanding [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6793.2s)]
*  nuance. It doesn't mean all sunscreens are bad and it doesn't mean that we shouldn't use sunscreen, [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6798.64s)]
*  but understanding what the risk factors are that are associated with different [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6804.4800000000005s)]
*  ingredients or different engineering that's been done to make sunscreens available [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6809.200000000001s)]
*  is important. But that's so many levels deep. It's a really difficult thing. Then people end up [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6812.320000000001s)]
*  being scientifically illiterate and being wrong because someone like RFK Jr. comes along and says, [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6816.4800000000005s)]
*  hey, should we really be engineering the earth with genetically modified mosquitoes? [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6821.52s)]
*  And then people have this call to action, shut those things down, shut those things down. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6824.96s)]
*  And they're incredibly beneficial and effective. They're not taking any sort of genetic editing to [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6828.56s)]
*  market. They're not doing anything that people might consider risky. And we can have a separate [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6832.64s)]
*  conversation about the risks and benefits of genome editing. That's another topic. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6836.56s)]
*  But how much of this Freiburg Archimath, as we get ready to wrap here, is a reaction to what happened [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6841.12s)]
*  with COVID-19 and people's fear now of getting sort of educated on gain of function research. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6847.6s)]
*  And, you know, this sort of recency effect of, my lord, doing some of this science feels like it's [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6854.160000000001s)]
*  too dangerous, certainly too dangerous to do inside the city. And what's the point of taking [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6860.240000000001s)]
*  bats out of caves and doing gain of function research? How much of it has to do with that [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6864.0s)]
*  right now? And this is sort of the downside to questioning that. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6869.200000000001s)]
*  Technology can be asymmetric. You can have like nuclear weapons can wipe out the world, [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6872.88s)]
*  they can wipe out the whole population. Yeah, you know, Taleb makes this point [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6879.2s)]
*  on his argument against GMOs, which I would argue against him on this point, [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6884.0s)]
*  but we could do that another time. If he's willing to come on the show. I'd be super happy to debate [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6888.16s)]
*  him on this point. But the idea being that there's super asymmetric downside. And so, you know, [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6892.8s)]
*  what happens is people see incremental improvements from technology, and they don't really praise those [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6898.72s)]
*  incremental improvements. They assume that to be the case. It's a linear step function. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6905.52s)]
*  But when something goes wrong, it's a big step down. And then people are like, oh, wow. And then [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6909.68s)]
*  people get scared of technology. And then people want to step away from it. And this is true in [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6915.360000000001s)]
*  anything that relates to your health, to food systems, to the environment now. Now, it doesn't [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6919.200000000001s)]
*  mean that all technology is bad or all engineering is bad. But, you know, as mistakes are made in the [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6924.96s)]
*  system, as new things are discovered, we have to retrench and change what we're doing. But it doesn't [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6929.280000000001s)]
*  mean that we should stop progress. And it doesn't mean that the whole system of humans figuring out [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6934.08s)]
*  how to engineer ourselves of the world around us to benefit the health to benefit the planet to [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6938.4s)]
*  benefit other species on the planet isn't a critical mission and effort that we should be [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6943.12s)]
*  undertaking. Well, the sunscreen thing is really tilting. I mean, I just I need to make sure I'm [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6947.5199999999995s)]
*  pretty sure we have a good one. But I don't. Yeah, I'm on this right now. I'm this has got me a little [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6951.92s)]
*  nervous with my kids. I like these. Like, I have all my kids have long sleeve sun shirts. And I try [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6956.72s)]
*  to do that, I think is like the key thing. And because I my family has skin cancer, I have to [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6965.4400000000005s)]
*  do that since I'm dark skinned. Freeburg. I mean, do you avoid skin cancer? I mean, I don't know. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6971.12s)]
*  I don't know why you wouldn't wear like a rash guard thing, you know. Yeah, you know, it's a summertime, you're in the [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6976.88s)]
*  bad, you know, you want to show off your revenge body. I get it. I get it. All right, everybody. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6982.0s)]
*  On behalf of sacks, let me just say Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine. Biden Biden Biden, and Francis, [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6989.12s)]
*  Mayor Francis is now in the race. So I guess we'll have him on the pod. We already talked to him. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=6998.96s)]
*  Oh, okay. So yeah, at the summit last year. And also, we're doing a survey for the podcast, [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=7004.4s)]
*  all in podcast.co slash survey, all in podcast.co slash s urve. Why if you got to this point in the [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=7009.76s)]
*  podcast, please fill out our survey or listener survey. And we will see you all next time on the [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=7018.24s)]

*  Oh, [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=7054.32s)]
*  we should all just get a room and just have one big huge or because they're all just like this like [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=7059.2s)]
*  sexual tension, but they just need to release it out. What your your feet? We need to get [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQXjboJwg0&t=7063.759999999999s)]
