# LA's Wildfire Disaster, Zuck Flips on Free Speech, Why Trump Wants Greenland
**All In Podcast:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU)
*  I just got a haircut with a new person. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=0.0s)]
*  She was like, I'm like, do what you want. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2.4s)]
*  This is what she did. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4.64s)]
*  Okay, well, let me know who she is. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5.76s)]
*  Chamath and I will go beat her up and get your money back. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=7.36s)]
*  Did she feather your bangs and blow your hair out? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=10.4s)]
*  She did. She gave you a blow, didn't she? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=12.64s)]
*  It's starting already. Okay. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=14.48s)]
*  No, but that's a blow dryer. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Just, yes, right? She blow dry your hair? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=17.36s)]
*  At the end, she gave me a little... [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=19.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's not sustainable. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=20.72s)]
*  So you can't tell what the quality of the haircut's like [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=21.84s)]
*  because you're never going to do that again. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=23.68s)]
*  You don't have the skill. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=24.88s)]
*  I've never blow dried my hair in my life. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=26.0s)]
*  No, I understand that. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=27.6s)]
*  This is why, because if you get the blow [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=28.48s)]
*  and it looks good in the blow... [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=30.0s)]
*  Just say blow out, please. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=31.28s)]
*  Just say blow out. It's a forward. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=33.2s)]
*  Why? What are we, six? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=34.8s)]
*  Just grow up, you... [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=35.92s)]
*  The way you're saying it, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=37.36s)]
*  you're saying it to provoke a reaction. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=38.4s)]
*  Come on. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=40.32s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=40.96s)]
*  Such a liar. I love it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=42.32s)]
*  Tell us about what your rules for blows are. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=44.64s)]
*  What I'm saying is if you get a haircut [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=46.56s)]
*  and you get a blow, it's very hard for you to know... [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=48.8s)]
*  No, but I'm serious. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=53.2s)]
*  It's very hard for you to know [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=54.08s)]
*  what it's going to look like the next day [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=55.84s)]
*  when you take a shower and when you don't blow it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=58.4s)]
*  That's true. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=62.08s)]
*  Oh, you're saying the self-blow [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  can't match the stylist blow. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=64.72s)]
*  It's just important when you get a haircut [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=66.16s)]
*  with a new stylist or a hairdresser or a barista. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=67.84s)]
*  You cannot let them blow you. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=72.0s)]
*  He's not happy with the ending. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=73.6s)]
*  Got it. It was an unhappy ending. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=75.84s)]
*  Because when you blow yourself, Chamath, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=78.0s)]
*  which people have accused you of blowing yourself [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=80.64s)]
*  on this very program, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=83.12s)]
*  when you blow yourself, it's not going to come out the way it did. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=84.32s)]
*  It won't be as fabulous. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  Every time I've blown myself, it's been perfect. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  All right, everybody. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=110.88s)]

*  and celebrate the big Trump victory and tape an episode there with us. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=167.76s)]
*  Of course, David Freberg, your resident Sultan of Science, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=173.12s)]
*  and not a moment too soon. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=177.04s)]
*  We have so much to talk about. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=177.92s)]
*  What's the background here? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=178.88s)]
*  Those are some dead trees with Mount Fuji in the background. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=181.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's a Kurosawa landscape. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=185.76s)]
*  While you've been gallivanting and being a dilettante, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=189.04s)]
*  your original adopted home state is burning to the ground. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=193.04s)]
*  Yes, I know about this. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=196.88s)]
*  I got off the ski lift and I saw this after I had posted like, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=197.84s)]
*  oh, my life is amazing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=202.48s)]
*  And I was like, oh my God, you know, you can totally. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=203.84s)]
*  Everybody replied like, are you the room? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=207.28s)]
*  And I'm like, oh my Lord, this is unbelievable. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=210.24s)]
*  We'll obviously talk about that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=213.68s)]
*  So then you promoted the tweet. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=214.72s)]
*  Yes, I put $500 behind it to boost it to try to get my ratings up. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=217.84s)]
*  No, I actually literally deleted it because I posted and I never do that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=221.04s)]
*  But I posted a video where I was like, oh my God, it's incredible. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=224.24s)]
*  And I was like, you know what? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=226.72s)]
*  This is the wrong time for it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=228.0s)]
*  So a little grace there, folks. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=229.52s)]
*  And I am so happy to have here on all in idle, the one, the only my good friend, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=232.16s)]
*  Cyan Banner, our good friend. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=240.72s)]
*  She's my good friend before you guys met her. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=243.36s)]
*  So she's ours, but I've been friends with her longer. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=244.88s)]
*  So my good friend, Cyan Banner, our good friend and our bestie. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=248.0s)]
*  Let's just leave it at that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=251.12s)]
*  It doesn't have to be a competition for who's I am. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=252.08s)]
*  My best will ask her to rate at the end of the episode. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=254.16000000000003s)]
*  Cyan, welcome to the program. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=256.64s)]

*  Jason, you want to tell people about science background? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=262.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, do an epic rant on science. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=265.2s)]
*  Epic. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, Cyan and I fought in the clone wars together. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=267.46000000000004s)]
*  It was a long time ago, but she's a technologist, self-made individual [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=270.72s)]
*  who then decided she would start writing small angel checks about 14 years ago. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=275.92s)]
*  Literally the same year I did and myself, Cyan. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=281.03999999999996s)]
*  She's profoundly better than you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=285.12s)]

*  Yes, of course. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=288.64s)]
*  We'll get into it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=290.23999999999995s)]
*  And Cyan and I would 14 years ago, I guess, we would meet startup companies together and host [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=291.35999999999996s)]
*  little events where we get together and take pitches. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  And we invested in a couple of companies together and it worked out very nicely for [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=304.56s)]
*  everyone involved. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=308.32s)]
*  Yeah, we're in a couple of companies together. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=310.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  Density. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  Density. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=313.35999999999996s)]
*  We were on the board together for a little bit, so that was fun. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=314.08s)]
*  A little bit, yeah. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=316.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  Thumbtack. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  Thumbtack. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  Actually, Thumbtack, Density, and Uber, I all discovered through you. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=319.44s)]
*  Which one was Uber? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=326.55999999999995s)]
*  I got to check my... [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=327.2s)]
*  Oh, and I don't think you're allowed to say them. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=328.32s)]
*  I don't think you're allowed to say them. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=330.0s)]
*  Let me check my Google Sheet here. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=330.47999999999996s)]
*  I didn't know I invested in Uber. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=331.76s)]
*  Let me check. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=332.96s)]
*  I have to confirm that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=333.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I did. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=334.32s)]
*  But at one of these events, I introduced Cyan to Uber. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=335.35999999999996s)]
*  That's true. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=338.48s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=338.88s)]
*  Yeah, so found all three of those deals at your events, so that was really great. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=339.20000000000005s)]
*  Well, thanks. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=344.0s)]
*  That's a very nice... [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=344.48s)]
*  Let me try. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=345.68s)]
*  Cyan is a prolific angel investor. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=347.6s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=349.76s)]
*  I just said that. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  She was a part of Founders Fund. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=351.76s)]
*  Oh, right. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=354.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=355.04s)]
*  She runs a seed fund called Long Journey Ventures. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=355.52000000000004s)]
*  Some of her hits include SpaceX, Anderil, Density, Postmates, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=360.08000000000004s)]
*  Niantic, which is the makers of Pokemon Go, and Jason's favorite startup, Uber. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=367.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's been a good run. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=374.8s)]
*  It's been a good run. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=375.59999999999997s)]
*  And also, I'll just add a wonderful human being. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=376.24s)]
*  And if you ever had the chance to hang out and talk for a couple of hours, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=379.12s)]
*  Cyan would be one of those people that you put right at the top of the list. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=382.88s)]
*  I will promote Cyan's interview with Tim Ferriss a couple of weeks ago. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=386.4s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=390.47999999999996s)]
*  I randomly turned it on. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=390.96s)]
*  I was in the car driving home. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=392.4s)]
*  And then I stopped in my driveway and kept listening. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=394.24s)]
*  I was just telling Cyan it was a fantastic, what was it, about two hours? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=396.4s)]
*  Two and a half hour interview? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=400.08s)]
*  Three. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=401.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, it was four hours. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=401.52s)]
*  Three hours. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=402.32s)]
*  I think he cut it to three and a half. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=403.91999999999996s)]
*  And then I had to drive again. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=404.47999999999996s)]
*  And I was excited to get back to it, which never happens for me [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=406.88s)]
*  listening to long-form interviews like that. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=409.67999999999995s)]
*  It was phenomenal. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=411.44s)]
*  So I recommend it to everyone. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  Why did it hit you so deeply? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=414.32s)]
*  Couple things. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=416.15999999999997s)]
*  One, Cyan is an incredible storyteller. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=416.64s)]
*  The way she describes her experiences, her history, her life, beautiful. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  She talks in kind of, I think, a deep persuasive way about some of the things [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=425.28s)]
*  that have shaped her, her business investing, as well as kind of spirituality, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=430.32s)]
*  which she mentioned earlier, which is not something that you'll typically, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=435.04s)]
*  and you're like, wait, where did this conversation just pivot to? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=437.2s)]
*  And then you go down this whole other path with her and you go on the journey with her. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=439.52s)]
*  I just thought it was great. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=442.56s)]
*  So all over the place, it was great, beautiful. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=443.52s)]
*  Recommend it to everyone to get to know Cyan. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, thanks. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=448.32s)]
*  Can I have you all as my professional cheerleading squad from now on? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=448.8s)]
*  That's pretty awesome. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=452.0s)]
*  I don't like talking about myself, and this is great. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=453.20000000000005s)]
*  I love it. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=455.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, it's true. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=456.96000000000004s)]
*  Cyan was voted most humble in our angel investing group, and I was a close second. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=458.32s)]
*  So I almost won most humble. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=462.72s)]
*  More work to do being humble. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=466.0s)]
*  I'm going to get you a t-shirt called the humblest. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=467.36s)]
*  You have to borrow it from Tramoth. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=470.40000000000003s)]
*  Seven or eight years ago, Jason approached Cyan and I and said, hey, guys, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=474.48s)]
*  Harvey Weinstein has asked me to make a show. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=478.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=481.44s)]
*  True story. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=482.18s)]
*  No, it's a true story. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=482.82s)]
*  Here's how he asked me to do it in his room. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=484.1s)]
*  It was really. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=485.94s)]
*  It's a true story. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=486.5s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=487.38s)]
*  Apparently. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=487.88s)]
*  Take it down a notch. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=488.66s)]
*  Cyan, myself, and Jason went to some place in the city and we taped a. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=489.7s)]
*  They taped an episode. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=494.9s)]
*  I have it. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=495.62s)]
*  What is it called? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=496.18s)]
*  The first episode? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=496.74s)]
*  We taped the NBC pilot for the accelerator or the incubator. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=497.54s)]
*  So I had been approached and did a pilot for NBC called the accelerator, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=502.42s)]
*  and they spent like a half million dollars on this and you guys came on and it came out great. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=509.94s)]
*  And it was just going to follow me around. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=514.18s)]
*  It was very, it was very awkward because afterwards they approached Cyan and I to do the show. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=515.62s)]
*  Without me. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=521.14s)]
*  When we without Jason. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=521.7s)]
*  And so we had to, we had to decide and we decided. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=523.06s)]
*  Cyan, who needs enemies? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=526.74s)]
*  We decided our friendship was more important. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=529.62s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=531.94s)]
*  I don't know if I ever told you guys a story, but like literally [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=532.74s)]
*  they were like figuring out where to put this and what time slot they were like, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=535.54s)]
*  we're going to do it in the summer because we're trying to get some summer programming [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=538.58s)]
*  going. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=541.22s)]
*  That's where we're going to test up. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=541.46s)]
*  And then Harvey Weinstein turns out to be an horrible monster and the whole thing gets [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=542.82s)]
*  canceled and anything that was anywhere within a hundred miles of Harvey Weinstein got canceled, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=546.34s)]
*  including my failed or forgotten reality TV show. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=552.0200000000001s)]
*  All right, let's get to more important things. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=556.5s)]
*  There is an unbelievable tragedy occurring in Los Angeles as we're speaking, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=559.5400000000001s)]
*  devastating wildfires, basically a form to ring around LA, the most destructive of which has been [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=565.7s)]
*  the Palisades fire and which has stretched into Malibu, obviously. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=572.5s)]
*  And 15,000 acres or so have been burned in that area. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=578.58s)]
*  Thousands of homes, maybe 2000 homes. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=582.74s)]
*  Here are some images. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=585.46s)]
*  They're just devastating. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=587.0600000000001s)]
*  And we have a lot of friends in this area and the area you're seeing on fire. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=588.34s)]
*  If you don't know the topography of Los Angeles is north of Santa Monica. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=593.38s)]
*  You have Palisades and then Malibu. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=597.62s)]
*  And obviously east of the 405, you have things that you've heard of like Bel Air and Brentwood. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=599.62s)]
*  This area is part of a mountain area called the Santa Monica mountains and they get very dry. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=604.18s)]
*  And there's a phenomenon which we'll get into called the Santa and it winds that blow really, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=613.22s)]
*  really strongly. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=618.58s)]
*  And a perfect storm has happened where thousands of homes and tragically five lives and I'm sure [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=619.62s)]
*  there will be more, unfortunately, have burned it down. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=625.62s)]
*  This video of driving down PCH. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=629.62s)]
*  If you've ever driven PCH, the Pacific Coast Highway, these are 10, 20, $50 million homes [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=634.58s)]
*  that are literally on the Pacific Ocean. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=641.14s)]
*  The most coveted homes in Los Angeles are not Bel Air and Brentwood. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=643.38s)]
*  You might think that because you hear them on TV. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=647.46s)]
*  But really, if you were an incredibly successful person, you would aspire to live in the Pacific [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=649.7800000000001s)]
*  Palisades just west of Brentwood and just south of Malibu or Malibu. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=654.74s)]
*  Many celebrities live there, many executives, etc. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=659.22s)]
*  And these homes are gone. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=663.22s)]
*  Thousands and thousands of homes. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=665.7s)]
*  This has turned into the ultimate Rorschach test on social media where people are projecting into [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=668.4200000000001s)]
*  this tragedy, which tragically occurs every year to varying degrees. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=675.86s)]
*  And maybe every 20, 30 years, it's an acute situation. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=680.5s)]
*  We'll get into that in a moment. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=683.62s)]
*  But looking at this absolute, just devastating loss of property and lives, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=685.38s)]
*  the lives could have been a lot worse. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=692.26s)]
*  Freeburg, from a scientific perspective, maybe we'll start there. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=693.38s)]
*  When you look at these wildfires, extreme weather, global warming, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=698.26s)]
*  and you look at this situation, is that where your mind goes? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=703.62s)]
*  Or in this Rorschach test of how you feel about these kind of tragedies and how you [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=706.82s)]
*  interpret it, do you go somewhere else? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=712.1s)]
*  The incompetence of California's government, DEI, Ukraine. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=713.54s)]
*  I mean, everybody is superimposing on this natural disaster, whatever their pet issues are. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=718.5s)]
*  Where do you come to when you look at this? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=726.42s)]
*  I don't think that those are exclusive. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=728.82s)]
*  I think that you can have had both incompetent planning and execution by leadership, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=732.5s)]
*  as well as have kind of uncontrollable circumstances that management and planning [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=741.9399999999999s)]
*  weren't necessarily going to solve. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=748.8199999999999s)]
*  And I'll kind of talk about a couple of these points real quick. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=750.02s)]
*  First of all, we talked about when the hurricane hit a couple of months ago, remember? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=753.62s)]
*  As you guys know, I have an office or facility out in Nashville. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=759.14s)]
*  So we were exposed to the flooding circumstances and we talked about the [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=761.9399999999999s)]
*  frequency of that sort of an event, having been such a rare occurrence becoming more common. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=765.86s)]
*  Similarly, we're seeing more frequent high wind events in California, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=772.42s)]
*  flooding events in California, and extremely hot events in California. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=776.42s)]
*  If you look at this link I sent out, Nick, in terms of the total precipitation over this current, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=780.66s)]
*  what's called, rain season, the Southern California region is basically at a, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=785.38s)]
*  you know, call it 0% of normal. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=791.38s)]
*  So this is Southern California. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=793.46s)]
*  You can see that third column. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=794.74s)]
*  That's the percent of normal rainfall that has been experienced. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=796.58s)]
*  There's been zero rain in these regions. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=799.7s)]
*  So everything is primed to be very dry. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=802.58s)]
*  And then you get these Santa Ana winds, 100 mile an hour winds. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=805.06s)]
*  No matter how much underbrush you clear out, no matter how many trees you remove, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=808.82s)]
*  if there's some embers in the air, there's a 100 mile an hour wind, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=813.06s)]
*  that is going to create a fire hurricane and a lot of homes are going to get caught on fire. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=816.5799999999999s)]
*  So it's very hard to kind of just pin the blame solely on not doing underbrush clearing, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=820.66s)]
*  not doing removal of trees. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=825.6199999999999s)]
*  Those should have happened. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=827.6999999999999s)]
*  They didn't happen. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=828.9s)]
*  That was wrong. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=830.02s)]
*  That was bad policy. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=830.7399999999999s)]
*  But it doesn't excuse the fact that there's a natural event that happened here [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=832.26s)]
*  that seems to be occurring with greater frequency. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=836.3399999999999s)]
*  The thing I'll kind of pivot to, if we want to get there now, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=838.8199999999999s)]
*  maybe we'll talk about that in a minute. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=841.2199999999999s)]
*  It's kind of the economic and the policy issues with respect to the Department of Insurance. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=842.34s)]
*  OK. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=846.74s)]
*  Let's get to that after we go through maybe a little bit of the quick reactions here. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=847.5400000000001s)]
*  I think that's where there's going to be real pain and devastation. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=851.22s)]
*  And that's the biggest economic consequence is the role that insurance has played in all this stuff, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=854.1800000000001s)]
*  which we'll get to in a minute. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=858.1800000000001s)]
*  OK. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=859.86s)]
*  So Chamath, I think table stakes, we all agree, global warming, extreme weather, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=860.02s)]
*  depending on what degree you believe in it, there's place some factor here. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=865.14s)]
*  And this is something that has reoccurred over and over again in this specific [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=869.9399999999999s)]
*  region. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=874.8199999999999s)]
*  But on social media, we're seeing a lot of other interpretations of this event, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=875.54s)]
*  maybe your thoughts on some of the other interpretations. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=879.78s)]
*  And then when you look at it, what do you start to think about preventing this in the future? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=882.66s)]
*  Or maybe who's responsible? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=888.26s)]
*  What's your general take on what we've seen in the last week? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=890.0999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'm not very sympathetic to the there were 100 mile an hour winds. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=893.54s)]
*  Not because it's not true, but there's been enough modeling that we know that these kinds of [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=899.3s)]
*  outlier weather events are happening in greater and greater frequency. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=906.9s)]
*  Nick, maybe you can find this and just put it up here. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=912.0999999999999s)]
*  But remember that crazy apocalyptic video of that exact same part of Southern California [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=914.42s)]
*  in 2018 burning to the ground? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=921.62s)]
*  Can we just look at that all of us collectively? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=925.54s)]
*  Because that was six years ago. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=928.02s)]
*  This is not like it was a distant memory from 100 years ago. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=931.62s)]
*  We knew in 2018 that these types of- [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=936.34s)]
*  The Sepulveda passed. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=938.9s)]
*  So this idea that we were just lollygagging around and got caught off guard by 100 mile [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=940.42s)]
*  an hour winds to me is completely not an acceptable answer. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=946.34s)]
*  We knew in 2018 that these things could happen. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=950.66s)]
*  We knew across the rest of the United States that these outlier weather events were happening [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=953.78s)]
*  in greater and greater frequency. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=957.86s)]
*  If you weren't sure, you saw most of the insurance companies try to dump Southern [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=960.26s)]
*  California homes fire coverage three months before this event happened. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=965.14s)]
*  So all this data was in the realm of the knowable. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=970.1800000000001s)]
*  And then when you double click and you get into a little bit more of the details, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=974.82s)]
*  there's a level of incompetence bordering on criminal negligence here that we need to [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=979.22s)]
*  get to the bottom of. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=984.66s)]
*  So I'll just give you a couple of facts. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=985.54s)]
*  In the 1950s, the average amount of timber, so wood that was harvested in California, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=988.1800000000001s)]
*  was around 6 billion board feet per year. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=995.3000000000001s)]
*  In the intervening 70 years, that shrank to about 1.5 billion board feet. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=999.78s)]
*  And so you'd say, okay, well, that's a 75% reduction. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1005.54s)]
*  We must be making a very explicit stance on conservation. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1009.94s)]
*  It turns out that that's not entirely true because what it left behind [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1014.02s)]
*  was nearly 163 million dead trees. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1018.34s)]
*  Dead, like gone. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1023.14s)]
*  And so you would say, well, those things should have been removed. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1025.7s)]
*  And the problem is that then there's this California Environmental Quality Act, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1029.38s)]
*  CEQA, hopefully I'm pronouncing this right. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1034.42s)]
*  And a whole bunch of these other regulatory policies that limited the ability of local [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1037.38s)]
*  governments and fire management to clear these dead trees and vegetation. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1042.02s)]
*  And I think that that's a really big deal. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1046.18s)]
*  And when you double click on that, here's where you find the real head scratcher. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1048.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1053.14s)]
*  Multiple bills, AB 2330, AB 1951, AB 2639, all rejected by the Democrat controlled [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1055.14s)]
*  legislature or worse vetoed by Governor Newsom, that would have exempted these wildfire [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1064.66s)]
*  prevention projects from CEQA and other permitting issues. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1070.66s)]
*  Then there were other bills to try to minimize the risk of fires by burying power lines [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1076.66s)]
*  underground, SB 103 as an example, went nowhere, didn't even get to the governor's desk. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1081.0600000000002s)]
*  So I'm just a little bit at a loss to explain these two bodies of data. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1088.5800000000002s)]
*  One is everybody can see that these events are happening. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1095.0600000000002s)]
*  Southern California lived through this exact type of moment just six years ago. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1099.38s)]
*  All the bills that are meant to prevent this are blocked or vetoed. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1106.66s)]
*  This is the ultimate expression of negligence and incompetence. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1111.94s)]
*  Okay, Cyan, you've heard Jamath and Freberg's take here. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1117.3000000000002s)]
*  Some amount of incompetence, some amount of, hey, this keeps occurring and there might be [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1123.0600000000002s)]
*  some global warming that is contributing to it. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1127.3s)]
*  What do you take away from this situation? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1129.94s)]
*  Sure. I agree with Freberg and Jamath. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1131.94s)]
*  It's a lot of everything. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1135.86s)]
*  But I also think that to add to the prevention part, other than clearing out underbrush and [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1138.02s)]
*  trees and things like that, we don't build things in the state of California in a way that [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1143.86s)]
*  houses should be built when you know that there are fires like this. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1151.62s)]
*  So for example, we have more wooden roofs than we really should have. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1154.66s)]
*  We should really evaluate our materials that we're building things out of. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1158.02s)]
*  But we also have down in El Segundo, this is a company that I invested in, Rainmaker. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1162.18s)]
*  We have the ability now to cloud seed and do preventative measures to actually [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1168.02s)]
*  make a region have more water. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1172.3400000000001s)]
*  And I don't understand why we're not looking into things like this that could have prevented. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1175.7s)]
*  We knew that this storm was coming. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1181.3000000000002s)]
*  We knew that these winds were coming. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1183.22s)]
*  Southern California shut power down. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1186.42s)]
*  I have a farm down there. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1188.42s)]
*  We still don't have power because they knew that most of these fires were started by PG&E [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1189.78s)]
*  or down power lines. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1194.82s)]
*  And so they proactively shut everybody down and we're still running on generators. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1196.34s)]
*  And if you notice, there's no fires down there, but they also have 100 mile per hour winds. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1200.18s)]
*  And you're not seeing it. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1206.42s)]
*  And there's plenty of mountain ranges and dryness there. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1207.22s)]
*  You know, avocado farms are basically just sitting fuel. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1209.54s)]
*  So I do think it's a combination of all of those things. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1214.82s)]
*  And competence is definitely one of them. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1218.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1221.38s)]
*  And I actually lived right next door to this area for a long time in Brentwood. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1221.7s)]
*  And to your point about roofs, it seems silly. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1226.74s)]
*  And a lot of these fire prevention things can seem silly when you first mention them. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1229.3s)]
*  Which Trump looked, let's face it, the way he says things sometimes is very colorful. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1233.8600000000001s)]
*  Now, when he said, listen, you're not raking like people in wherever he said it, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1238.74s)]
*  Scandinavia, Finland are raking the forest. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1241.6200000000001s)]
*  And he was absolutely 100% correct on that. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1244.02s)]
*  Maybe it sounded bombastic or silly when the way he said it. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1246.66s)]
*  But the truth is in Tahoe, where we just were over the holidays, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1250.34s)]
*  people are clearing underbrush. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1254.58s)]
*  When I lived in Los Angeles, people who lived in the Hollywood Hills would get a fine if [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1256.66s)]
*  they didn't clear it. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1260.02s)]
*  But there are mountain ranges that nobody owns. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1261.78s)]
*  And when you showed that Sepulveda Pass, that's the 405 going past the Getty Center. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1264.34s)]
*  That area has got to be cleaned by the city and the government. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1268.1s)]
*  And maybe they weren't doing it as much. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1271.78s)]
*  RICK KLEFFELTEN Look at this. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1273.62s)]
*  This is apocalyptic. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1274.6599999999999s)]
*  JASON KLEFFELTEN Yeah. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1275.86s)]
*  So I know this passed very well because I would drive through it. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1276.6599999999999s)]
*  RICK KLEFFELTEN Jason, what did California learn from this? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1279.06s)]
*  What did Gavin Newsom implement based on what happened here? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1281.86s)]
*  What did the city of Los Angeles implement based on what happened here? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1286.58s)]
*  I want to just specifically know the answer to those two questions. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1290.5s)]
*  JASON KLEFFELTEN Yeah. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1293.1399999999999s)]
*  And I think that's going to be a big part of this breakdown after this happens. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1293.6999999999998s)]
*  Because in a lot of these cases, you might lose a home or two, but you haven't had this [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1297.54s)]
*  kind of wholesale destruction in a while. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1302.58s)]
*  And when I lived in Brentwood, I had a shake roof. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1304.98s)]
*  That's a fancy way of saying shingles, wood shingles. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1307.78s)]
*  And they would bake in the sun. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1310.98s)]
*  And I love this roof. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1312.58s)]
*  But my neighbors who in Brentwood were all 70, 80 years old, and I was right on Sunset [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1313.62s)]
*  Boulevard. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1317.1399999999999s)]
*  And I could look up from my house and see the place you just showed, which is the Getty [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1317.78s)]
*  Center and the Sepulveda Pass on the 405 and Sunset Boulevard. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1321.62s)]
*  I was only allowed cyan to replace 30% of my roof at a time. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1327.3s)]
*  You couldn't replace it and put shake roofs on. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1330.5s)]
*  You could only like maintain it. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1332.6599999999999s)]
*  Because in 1961, there was the Bel Air and Brentwood fires. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1334.58s)]
*  And these fires, you want to talk about like in memory, Chamath, this one, Ja Ja Gabor [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1338.5s)]
*  and tons of celebrities lost their homes as well. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1344.8999999999999s)]
*  This one was started because of the Santa Ana winds. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1346.8999999999999s)]
*  And somebody was just burning a rubbish pile. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1350.58s)]
*  I think it was some construction workers were burning that. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1352.4199999999998s)]
*  They said to me, the neighbors, do you know about the Bel Air fire? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1355.06s)]
*  You know what the Brentwood fire? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1358.1s)]
*  You got to get rid of that shake roof. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1359.22s)]
*  You got to get rid of that shake roof. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1360.42s)]
*  When my daughter was born, the roofer said to me, let's put composites on. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1361.3799999999999s)]
*  I put composites on and he said, what do you want to do with the sprinkler system? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1366.34s)]
*  And I said, there's a sprinkler system in my little one story ranch house. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1368.98s)]
*  He said, yeah. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1371.78s)]
*  I said, I've never seen it. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1372.66s)]
*  And he showed it to me. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1373.86s)]
*  It was on the roof. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1374.58s)]
*  People were so scared after that 62 fire. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1375.78s)]
*  They were putting these on the roof. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1377.7s)]
*  And now you cannot have. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1379.94s)]
*  Wood roofs have been banned. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1381.22s)]
*  You were grandfathered in. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1382.74s)]
*  I was part of that. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1383.78s)]
*  But there was a lot of PTSD from that. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1385.06s)]
*  And now I do think there's going to have to be some lessons learned. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1387.1399999999999s)]
*  And let's get to where some folks online are pointing to maybe not having great priorities [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1390.74s)]
*  and maybe focusing on things that are not as important as the taxpaying citizens. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1399.06s)]
*  A lot of tweets. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1404.18s)]
*  I don't know how people feel about them, about DEI, about who's running the fire department, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1405.78s)]
*  et cetera. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1410.8999999999999s)]
*  Did you have any thoughts on that? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1411.54s)]
*  Friedberg? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1413.22s)]
*  I mean, look, one of the things I wanted to talk about was the DOI's role [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1414.74s)]
*  or the Department of Insurance role in what I think will ultimately be. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1418.82s)]
*  Creating a pretty significant economic consequence here from this sort of an event. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1424.42s)]
*  I don't but I'll answer your question. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1429.54s)]
*  OK. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1431.7s)]
*  I don't think that the mission of any public service organization [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1432.98s)]
*  should be to meet DEI metrics. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1439.7800000000002s)]
*  I think the mission of that public service organization should be to serve the public. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1443.6200000000001s)]
*  And I think that those DEI metrics should not be a priority [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1448.8200000000002s)]
*  when serving the public is the objective. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1453.7s)]
*  The best ability to serve the public should be the objective. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1456.8200000000002s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1460.02s)]
*  And I'll state that really clearly. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1461.8600000000001s)]
*  So obviously, the fire chief in LA is getting a lot of attention. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1464.1000000000001s)]
*  Whether or not that prioritization of DEI metrics [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1469.22s)]
*  took away from the interest and the focus in preparing for major disasters, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1474.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1478.18s)]
*  There have been some interviews over the last day or two, just to be fair, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1478.74s)]
*  where she has claimed that they asked for more money. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1482.1000000000001s)]
*  They would not be able to be prepared for major disasters. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1485.3000000000002s)]
*  If the budget cut took place that was proposed by Bass, that budget cut did take place. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1488.1000000000001s)]
*  And so the fire chief has said that she asked for budget to make this [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1493.5400000000002s)]
*  the preparation for this sort of an event and she lost it. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1496.98s)]
*  And so I don't want to just say, hey, she's to blame, she's to blame, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1499.94s)]
*  because she was focused on DEI. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1502.66s)]
*  But I will separately say that I think that creating DEI as a mission [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1504.2600000000002s)]
*  for an organization that's supposed to serve the public interest makes no sense. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1507.3000000000002s)]
*  This is an important one. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1510.66s)]
*  James Woods, obviously the famous actor who lost his home in Pacific Palisades, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1511.46s)]
*  has been going on a bit of a rant about Christine Crowley. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1517.46s)]
*  She is L.A.'s fire chief. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1520.42s)]
*  She also happens to be a lesbian and has made a priority and done a number of talks on [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1523.38s)]
*  trying to increase diversity inside of the fire department. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1530.18s)]
*  She also, just with a bit of research, is one of the top performing firefighters, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1534.66s)]
*  a paramedic, an engineer, a fire inspector, a captain, a battalion chief, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1540.26s)]
*  an assistant chief, fire marshal, deputy chief. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1544.5800000000002s)]
*  And when she took the firefighter exam in the late 90s, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1546.98s)]
*  she scored in the top 50 out of 16,000. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1548.9s)]
*  She seems eminently qualified. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1550.98s)]
*  There has been a massive pile on attack on her. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1553.14s)]
*  And you know how it is on X and other social networks where people are really tweaked about [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1556.3400000000001s)]
*  DEI, that they're kind of putting the blame on her. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1562.42s)]
*  What are your thoughts of this DEI angle, Chema? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1565.46s)]
*  I don't think this is to blame. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1567.6200000000001s)]
*  OK. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1569.46s)]
*  If all of a sudden, because of DEI, 70% were physically incapable of carrying out the task, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1570.5800000000002s)]
*  and that's why these fires grew, maybe you could make the claim that it is a DEI problem. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1578.5s)]
*  I do agree with Freeberg that the thing that these public institutions need to do [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1584.9s)]
*  a better job of is being very clear about what their North Star is. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1592.34s)]
*  I think the North Star for the fire department is to save people's lives and put out fires. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1596.58s)]
*  I think the North Star for the police service should be to save people's lives and to hold [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1602.74s)]
*  criminals responsible and get them off the streets. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1607.46s)]
*  And you should hire the people that allow you to do that job the best. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1611.06s)]
*  The thing to keep in mind is that there were probably 20 or 30 people interviewed to be [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1614.9s)]
*  fire chief. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1620.42s)]
*  It's not her fault that she was selected. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1621.6200000000001s)]
*  The real question is, what was she mandated to focus on once she got the job? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1625.38s)]
*  And I think what you see in all of these interviews is I don't think that she, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1630.9s)]
*  all of a sudden, after growing up through the fire service, had this DEI bent. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1634.26s)]
*  I think typically what happens is it becomes an institutional directive. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1638.18s)]
*  It guides your compensation. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1643.54s)]
*  It guides your recognition. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1645.06s)]
*  And so you do it. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1646.58s)]
*  It's sort of what Charlie Munger says. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1647.3799999999999s)]
*  Show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1649.62s)]
*  The entire public service is riddled with this. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1652.02s)]
*  The entire private service is riddled with this, which is that we've lost the script [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1655.06s)]
*  about what is important. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1660.42s)]
*  So it's yet another example. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1662.74s)]
*  She's probably quite a capable person who, if was just allowed to focus on fighting [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1664.18s)]
*  fires and savings people's lives, would probably do a good job. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1669.22s)]
*  But if you had to add all these other things that are not germane to that task, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1673.14s)]
*  then people will get frustrated and projected onto her. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1678.26s)]
*  And it seems like a lot of projecting going on here, Chamathia. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1680.8200000000002s)]
*  I agree. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1683.8600000000001s)]
*  All of that said, though, I think you got to go back to how did these fires start? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1684.26s)]
*  How did they grow out of control? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1688.9s)]
*  And again, I think that these winds didn't come out of nowhere in the sense that they [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1690.98s)]
*  caught everybody off guard. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1695.8600000000001s)]
*  This has happened before. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1697.38s)]
*  That area has gone through this exact moment. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1699.38s)]
*  There were laws that were proposed. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1703.38s)]
*  They were vetoed. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1705.3000000000002s)]
*  So that even if you could have controlled it, then you see certain developers like [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1707.94s)]
*  Rick Caruso who were able to protect the buildings that he was responsible for because he took [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1713.14s)]
*  proactive and protective measures. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1719.46s)]
*  Could those proactive and protective measures not be taken more broadly through L.A. County? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1722.02s)]
*  Of course they could have. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1726.66s)]
*  Why were they not? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1728.74s)]
*  And here what we're seeing on the screen is Rick Caruso's village. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1730.18s)]
*  Let me ask a very specific question. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1733.7s)]
*  Pacific Palisades. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1735.3s)]
*  How much money, and we know the answer to this, how much money did the government of [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1735.8600000000001s)]
*  California spend poorly, as it turns out, on homelessness? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1740.82s)]
*  It was about $21 billion and illegal immigrants. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1746.02s)]
*  I don't know what the final number is there, but I suspect in the tens of billions. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1749.54s)]
*  If you reappropriated those dollars to these kinds of protective mechanisms in these areas, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1753.62s)]
*  what would the outcome have been? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1758.74s)]
*  Maybe there still would have been a fire. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1759.94s)]
*  Maybe there would have been damage. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1761.62s)]
*  But it's hard for me to believe it would have been as bad as it is right now. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1763.22s)]
*  Yeah, I think what you're getting to here is we can confirm lesbians didn't cause the Santa [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1767.3799999999999s)]
*  winds to cause these fires, obviously. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1773.86s)]
*  But there is an issue that I think many people in the public, especially in California, who voted [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1776.74s)]
*  for this very leftist liberal ideology, are now starting to realize is, hey, wait a second, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1781.7s)]
*  what are the priorities here, Cyan? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1787.86s)]
*  What are we focused on and what should we be focused on? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1789.54s)]
*  And it's very easy to be focused on DEI and maybe things that aren't as important, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1792.74s)]
*  homelessness and move budget there. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1799.22s)]
*  But at the same time, they wouldn't give her $17 million. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1801.38s)]
*  They cut the fire budget. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1804.2600000000002s)]
*  She tried to fight it. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1805.6200000000001s)]
*  Well, that's not clear. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1806.42s)]
*  Now there's now the counter narrative is that she actually got an extra 50, Jason. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1807.94s)]
*  OK, so we're in a breaking news environment. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1812.5s)]
*  So we'll see what the truth winds up being here. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1814.98s)]
*  But Cyan, I think the point remains the same here, which is, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1818.98s)]
*  is prioritization and what we focus on out of whack in California? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1822.3400000000001s)]
*  Oh, without a doubt. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1827.0600000000002s)]
*  I think diversity is good unless that's all you have. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1828.1s)]
*  And I'll just simplify it like that. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1832.34s)]
*  And I think it's very sad that somebody could be very qualified and be in a position. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1835.1399999999999s)]
*  And we now have to question whether or not they were hired because of DEI. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1838.82s)]
*  And then it comes down to prioritization. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1842.98s)]
*  When you're dealing with an organization like a fire department, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1845.6999999999998s)]
*  whose main job is to protect the public and put out fires and save people, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1849.54s)]
*  any amount of time, as we know, is a valuable, precious resource that's being spent [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1853.78s)]
*  trying to roll out these programs. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1858.6599999999999s)]
*  Or, you know, it goes beyond just who you hire. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1860.34s)]
*  It's even the thought police of how you think, you know, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1864.26s)]
*  it's so pervasive within an organization that you die from the bureaucracy of it. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1868.6599999999999s)]
*  And if anything went wrong with DEI, it was that they didn't have their [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1874.6599999999999s)]
*  their eye on the prize of fighting fires. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1879.54s)]
*  And instead, you know, they're focusing on something that truly doesn't matter. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1882.1799999999998s)]
*  So you can be as diverse as you want to be and not be able to put out a fire. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1885.3s)]
*  And then it just really doesn't matter, right? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1888.58s)]
*  Because you're not training people. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1890.42s)]
*  You're not spending money on things that matter. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1891.7s)]
*  You're not having the discussions that matter. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1893.7s)]
*  And that's where I think that does fall apart. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1897.14s)]
*  And it has a place there. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1900.34s)]
*  But, you know, I go back to what Chamath said, though, you know, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1901.94s)]
*  it really comes down to prevention and learning from our past. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1904.66s)]
*  We seem to have a very short term memory. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1907.46s)]
*  And we forget very quickly because we rebuild and it looks pretty again. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1909.6200000000001s)]
*  And everybody forgets. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1913.14s)]
*  And we just don't have the ability as a society really to think long anymore. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1915.46s)]
*  And that's a real problem. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1920.42s)]
*  And I think we should learn from this fire. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1921.8600000000001s)]
*  I really hope that what comes out of this is a shift in political leanings in this in this state. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1924.5s)]
*  You know, I think more moderates are going to come to their senses. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1931.46s)]
*  And as we've seen with the election and the outcome, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1934.42s)]
*  and I think the state might shift some and we might actually get some policies that. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1938.18s)]
*  You're so right. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1941.8600000000001s)]
*  You're so right. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1942.98s)]
*  I mean, when are we going to get tired of all this late stage progressivism? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1943.6200000000001s)]
*  It's like these litany of excuses. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1948.74s)]
*  The people that are in charge have failed us yet again. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1950.9s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1954.02s)]
*  We have wasted so much money on so many things that don't move the needle. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1955.3s)]
*  And then the things that they needed to do, they didn't do. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1960.82s)]
*  And then they point the finger at climate change. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1965.06s)]
*  It's a joke. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1967.6200000000001s)]
*  At a certain point, you have to wonder, are we using politics [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1968.66s)]
*  and the purpose of it to make people's lives better and to have a high functioning society? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1972.34s)]
*  Or is it a way to first your signal or to share your opinions on things? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1978.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1983.1399999999999s)]
*  And I think what people are starting to realize is, you know, in an acute situation, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1983.4599999999998s)]
*  whether it's our budget deficit, whether it's schools, whether it's safety from climate, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1987.2199999999998s)]
*  you know, or non climate induced disasters, you do need to have competence. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1992.58s)]
*  And this is the Rick Caruso is such a competent executive that when he ran for office there, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=1996.74s)]
*  the fact that he didn't get that job is just absolutely crazy. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2001.38s)]
*  And you saw the mayor come in and she wouldn't even address, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2005.6200000000001s)]
*  she wouldn't answer any questions from the press, not even thoughts and prayers or, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2010.42s)]
*  you know, we're thinking of this or we're going to get it done. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2014.5s)]
*  It just seems like we're hiring non executives to work in functions that should be high performing [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2016.9s)]
*  executives. This is an operational role. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2023.22s)]
*  Let me maybe bring something that ties these three things together, but it builds on [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2025.7s)]
*  critically what Cyan said. There are so many people here that are good, hardworking people [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2030.18s)]
*  that lost their homes. For many of these folks, it could be the most single and only [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2036.5s)]
*  financially securing asset that they have. For other people, those that are family age, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2044.42s)]
*  they have kids now beyond the financial damage that are totally displaced. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2053.22s)]
*  Where will these folks go? There was a comment by Adam Carolla, a commentary, where he said, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2056.9s)]
*  the real test to Cyan's point will be how they internalize and metabolize this because it now [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2064.34s)]
*  affects them personally and they have to go and wait three years to build building permits to [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2071.94s)]
*  rebuild. Now that's assuming that they can even get a reasonable amount of insurance coverage, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2076.34s)]
*  which touches Freberg's point. This is the real tragedy. That is the actual tragedy multiplied [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2082.1s)]
*  by 120,000 or 200,000 families. The real question is how much of that was completely avoidable. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2088.02s)]
*  I think there is a reasonable amount of it that could have been. That's what really sucks and [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2096.1s)]
*  that's where you cannot take your finger off the scale and forget. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2101.14s)]
*  Yeah. When it lands on your doorstep, quite literally here, they are not going to be able [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2106.3399999999997s)]
*  having been in this exact area. I can tell you when you try to pull a permit to do anything, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2110.98s)]
*  as I was explaining with my roof, the regulations are deep and expensive and time consuming. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2116.18s)]
*  I don't believe the cat. We talked about the California coastal commission on a recent episode, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2123.86s)]
*  freeburg. What are the chances that the California coastal commission even allows these people to [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2128.26s)]
*  build those homes in those locations on PCH? Friedberg? I was talking to Chamath about this [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2133.62s)]
*  earlier today because the California coastal commission was created by the voters directly [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2139.06s)]
*  in 1976. That commission has authority that exceeds legislative action. My understanding [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2143.94s)]
*  is you'd have to go back to a state vote to rescind the powers of the California coastal [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2155.38s)]
*  commission. They have effective complete authority over deciding what does or doesn't get built on [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2159.06s)]
*  the coast because their objective is to preserve the coast for the use of the community and restore [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2165.54s)]
*  to its natural habitat. So anytime there's a request or a permit request, it can take two [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2169.7s)]
*  decades, three decades sometimes to get anything approved if they ever approve it at all. So the [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2174.2599999999998s)]
*  California coastal commission, any property that touches the beachfront in California, they have [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2179.54s)]
*  this kind of God level authority over and they're basically all political appointees that sit on the [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2186.18s)]
*  commission. To my question, freeburg, what are the chances they allow the millionaires on Pacific [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2191.3s)]
*  coast highway in Malibu to rebuild those homes or do you think they slow roll it and those people [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2197.86s)]
*  are all 50, 60, 70 years old, they'll never be able to rebuild their homes. The California commission [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2202.82s)]
*  just slow roll this and say, you know what, nature returned it to its natural state. I think we should [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2207.2200000000003s)]
*  talk about insurance. This is a great segue. Yeah, yeah, that's perfect segue. Yeah, this is the key [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2212.1800000000003s)]
*  point I wanted to say about insurance. So going forward, yeah, all of this property [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2215.78s)]
*  that sits in climate sensitive zones or weather sensitive zones, whatever you want to call it, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2221.0600000000004s)]
*  like we've talked about on the coast of California, of Florida and hurricane centers and tornado [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2226.1000000000004s)]
*  centers where the frequency of loss is going up, they're priced as if the frequency of loss is [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2231.0600000000004s)]
*  what it used to be, which is like, let's say you buy a home for a million dollars and the [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2238.42s)]
*  probability of your home getting wiped out by a natural disaster is a one in a thousand year [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2243.14s)]
*  kind of situation. So you have a one in a thousand chance of your home getting wiped out each year. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2247.7799999999997s)]
*  So your price for insurance on that million dollar home should be about 10,000 bucks a year, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2252.74s)]
*  one tenth of 1%. So 10,000 bucks a year for a million dollar home sounds expensive, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2256.42s)]
*  but it is what you have to pay for homeowners insurance. But now let's say that the probability [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2261.14s)]
*  shifts to one in 20 years. So now you've got a one in 20 year probability of your home getting [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2265.38s)]
*  wiped out. Are you going to pay 5% of your home value? No. And if you have a $10 million home, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2270.1s)]
*  are you going to pay $500,000 a year for property insurance? No. Now what's happened is the [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2278.58s)]
*  insurance companies have these models. They're called CAT models or catastrophe models. It used [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2284.74s)]
*  to be two companies. One was called RMS. The other one was called Equicat. And I used to work in this [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2289.54s)]
*  business, so I know it pretty well. And then all the companies started building in-house models. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2293.2999999999997s)]
*  And now there's startups that make models. And these models have shown that there are increased [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2297.06s)]
*  probability of complete loss in a region because of the increased probability of these crazy weather [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2300.66s)]
*  events happening. And so the price of insurance should go up. Here's the problem. There are 50 [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2305.14s)]
*  state insurance commissioners in the US. In order to sell insurance in a state, you have to have the [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2310.02s)]
*  insurance carrier and the policy approved in that state. And the states determine what rate or what [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2314.98s)]
*  price you can charge for insurance. So the state insurance commissions have a couple of goals. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2321.54s)]
*  Number one is to keep all the insurance companies solvent. So they want to check the financials of [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2326.34s)]
*  all the insurance companies, make sure they're not writing too many policies that they won't be able [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2330.7400000000002s)]
*  to pay out. The second thing is they want to make sure that the insurance companies aren't ripping [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2333.78s)]
*  consumers off. So they have control over the rates. And they don't want the rates to go up too much [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2338.26s)]
*  in any given year. So they're controlling rates and keeping them down. And then the third is [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2344.6600000000003s)]
*  they're supposed to make sure that consumers have access to insurance. And the third is a very hard [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2348.82s)]
*  thing to do. If you're trying to keep companies solvent, you can't write too many policies, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2352.98s)]
*  and you're saying, hey, you can't raise prices. And meanwhile, the probability of loss has gone [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2357.46s)]
*  up. So the insurance carriers are like, what choice do I have? So earlier this year, a state [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2361.7s)]
*  farm pulled out of Palisades. They stopped writing fire insurance in Palisades. They canceled 1600 [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2365.7s)]
*  policies in the exact neighborhood that just burned down. What about the timing of that free break? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2370.66s)]
*  That was three months before, six months before this happened? I think it was like six months before. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2375.3s)]
*  Yeah, but it seems crazy. But as you know, in Tahoe, a lot of the policies have been canceled. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2379.78s)]
*  Yes. So it's just crazy timing. It's a crazy coincidence. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2385.2200000000003s)]
*  And remember, in wine country, we had a lot of wipeouts. All of Santa Rosa was burnt out a few [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2389.1400000000003s)]
*  years ago. You guys remember that? And so they started pulling out of there. So a lot of the [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2393.7000000000003s)]
*  carriers are generally pulling out of California, because when they go up to the DOI and they're [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2397.7000000000003s)]
*  like, hey, we need to raise rates by, we need to double the price of insurance. We need to triple [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2401.3s)]
*  the price of insurance. This is now a one in 20 year event. The Department of Insurance says, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2404.9s)]
*  no, no, no, we're not going to let you charge that much to consumers. And then the carrier is like, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2408.9s)]
*  okay, we got no choice. And they exit the market. Here you can see right here, 1600 policies canceled. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2412.9s)]
*  This has been a big driver is the Department of Insurance has made it very difficult to find this [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2418.26s)]
*  free market outcome. But at the end of the day, one of three parties are going to end up eating the [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2422.42s)]
*  cost of the change in probability of loss that has occurred. It's either the homeowner, because [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2428.7400000000002s)]
*  they're going to end up losing the value of their home in a loss, or they're going to end up needing [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2433.78s)]
*  to write down the value of their home when they sell it to someone who will take on that risk, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2436.82s)]
*  which means the price has to come down. Or number two is the insurers and there's not enough [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2440.1800000000003s)]
*  insurance capital out there to cover all these losses. So all these insurers would go bankrupt, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2444.5800000000004s)]
*  or the third is the taxpayer. One of those three is going to end up eating the loss that's about [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2448.5800000000004s)]
*  to happen. You know the answer. You know, taxpayer taxpayer. Yeah, somebody is going to lobby [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2452.9s)]
*  somebody. But hey, we're sitting here, Chamath in the age of Doge and saying, hey, let's make the [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2457.78s)]
*  government smaller. In fact, Dave, you and I were talking about at some point, gangs of New York and [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2462.66s)]
*  the fire departments being- Oh yeah, totally. Great to talk about that. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2467.7799999999997s)]
*  We had a lot of crazy timing that we were talking about that two or three weeks before this happened. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2470.74s)]
*  But you know, when we look at making government smaller, well, that means that these kinds of [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2474.1s)]
*  situations would put citizens more on their own. So let's counterbalance what you think, Chamath, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2478.98s)]
*  about who should be responsible. We all espouse, I think, free market ideology on this program and [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2484.5s)]
*  as executives and in what we do every day, should the people who own these homes going forward, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2490.42s)]
*  who decide to rebuild them here, have to pay, you know, five, 10% of their value of home every year? [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2496.42s)]
*  Should their home prices collapse because it's too hard to build there? And should the free market [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2502.26s)]
*  take over this risk? Or should it constantly be put on the other 329 million Americans who are [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2506.42s)]
*  going to have to bear the brunt of what happens to the million people affected in this area? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2511.78s)]
*  Well, I mean, should's a very strong word. The cap on the insurance reimbursement is about [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2515.06s)]
*  three million is my understanding. David, you can tell me if I'm wrong, but I think that's right. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2521.7799999999997s)]
*  The houses in the palisades are anywhere from, call it one million on the low end to maybe 40 or 50 [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2526.5s)]
*  million on the high end. The average is four and a half in that- [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2532.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I was about to say. There's nothing for a million these days. Yeah, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2534.66s)]
*  it's got to be three or four minimum. Right, but the median is probably more [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2537.2999999999997s)]
*  instructive, which is probably seven or eight million. So my point is that folks will get [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2539.86s)]
*  less than half their home value back. They're going to have to come up with some amount of money [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2545.46s)]
*  to then rebuild, but the cost of rebuilding a 7,000 square foot house in the Pacific Palisades is [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2549.94s)]
*  probably at least a thousand a square foot. So that's seven million of cash. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2555.6200000000003s)]
*  It is. Exactly. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2558.5s)]
*  So now all of a sudden these people have to come up with a lot of money. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2559.38s)]
*  Exactly. And that's post-tax money. So you might as well double it because California is just [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2564.58s)]
*  egregiously burdensome in terms of taxes. So the individual homeowner is not going to be in a position [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2570.02s)]
*  to rebuild. I think that the liabilities of the insurance claims are going to be so massive that [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2576.6600000000003s)]
*  the state's going to look to the federal government to bail them out. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2586.02s)]
*  My parents just got evacuated. I got to call them and just- [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2589.2200000000003s)]
*  Call them back. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2592.02s)]
*  There's a new fire. Where are they in Ball Parkington? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2593.2200000000003s)]
*  Literally, right. There's a new fire called Kenneth Fire. It just took off and it's at their [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2595.14s)]
*  house. So just give me, I'll be back. Okay. Don't do your thing. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2600.58s)]
*  Oh, wow. Gosh almighty. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2603.7s)]
*  We're talking about, hey, maybe less government. Hey, maybe spending less. Now the same group of [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2605.7s)]
*  people, maybe who were saying, hey, we need to spend less and reduce the size of government, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2611.2999999999997s)]
*  are saying, hey, well, why isn't California more prepared? Well, being prepared obviously means [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2615.14s)]
*  more money and more taxes. So you have now these two competing ideologies here. But to the question [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2619.3s)]
*  of who is responsible, it is economically going to make no sense to rebuild unless you can get [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2626.9s)]
*  that insurance. It is a coveted place to live. But because of the construction costs have gone [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2631.94s)]
*  absolutely parabolic in California, because of regulations, you're talking about $14 million [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2636.82s)]
*  in income to build a $7 million house. And maybe you're just better off selling a lot for a million [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2643.3s)]
*  dollars and letting it be somebody else's problem going forward and just taking the two or three or [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2648.58s)]
*  $4 million loss. Who should pay for on a go forward basis underwriting these homes? [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2651.94s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, a lot of these people paid for, I was reading stories of 30 some odd years into [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2660.1s)]
*  insurance thinking that, you know, their house wouldn't burn down. And then of course it gets [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2665.14s)]
*  canceled two weeks before their house burns down. And then the one time they need it, they don't [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2668.98s)]
*  have it. And part of this is, I mean, a huge part of it is what Friedberg was talking about [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2672.42s)]
*  are the regulators. And so the free market solution is the only solution. If you look at, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2678.42s)]
*  I have an investment in a company called Kin Insurance, and they specialize in direct to [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2682.9s)]
*  consumer insurance for areas that are plagued with natural disasters. So their number one [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2687.3s)]
*  state out of the 11 that they serve is Florida, followed by Texas, which, you know, has tornadoes [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2693.7000000000003s)]
*  and things like that. And how they're able to get into these places and do insurance is the pricing [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2699.22s)]
*  is according to, you know, the construction of your home and all of these various things and also [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2704.58s)]
*  weather models and using data science, things that are not allowed in California, if you can believe [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2708.8999999999996s)]
*  it or not. So you're not allowed to use a weather model to price in, you know, your decision making [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2713.62s)]
*  for insurance in the state. And that just doesn't make a lot of sense. You know, you should be [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2719.7s)]
*  rewarded if you put the resources and time into your home to make it weatherproof, fireproof, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2724.1s)]
*  even earthquake resistant, right? This is more regulations that were laid out here to try to [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2732.58s)]
*  create equality, you know, in the fact is, it's now working against the system in Tahoe, to your [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2738.58s)]
*  point, they gave us explicit instructions around homes, put stone and pebbles around your home, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2747.2999999999997s)]
*  cut the trees and bushes down around your homes, do this over here, you know, your premiums, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2753.3s)]
*  when you do that, and if you do that, if you do that, which might cost $10,000 a home, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2758.5s)]
*  it would keep these from jumping from one to the other in most fire situations. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2763.94s)]
*  Freeburg, you're back, is everything okay? [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2768.42s)]
*  It's not okay listening to your, you know, 70 something year old parents evacuate their home [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2771.54s)]
*  and try and pack their cars with all their stuff in a matter of minutes while a fire creeps on their [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2777.1400000000003s)]
*  home is a pretty hard thing to listen to. Yeah. But are they saying they're trying to get out of [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2782.58s)]
*  the house? They're throwing everything in the car. There's a vacuum. If I'm looking at the video [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2787.54s)]
*  right now, the fire is like right by their house. It's insane. It's literally like walks away from [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2791.86s)]
*  their house. God, this is not just the house I grew up in, in LA. So sorry, man. Gosh, blocks away. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2796.9s)]
*  And I'm like, you know, what do you say to them? Like throw all the photo albums in the car is [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2804.34s)]
*  what I said. Throw the photo, like just grab the frame photos. My mom's trying to grab all her like, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2808.34s)]
*  that's the number one thing that everybody misses. And it's mentioned in every interview that I've [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2812.98s)]
*  seen is photographs. I'm like, grab all the photos, grab all the albums. And she's like, you know, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2817.7s)]
*  she's grabbing her jewelry and stuff. And I'm like, grab the photos like we're the last generation [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2823.2999999999997s)]
*  that will be thinking about this issue of grabbing the photos. Yeah. Fascinating. I just want to say, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2827.2999999999997s)]
*  like, you know, as we wrap up this segment, you know, obviously we're thinking about everybody [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2832.58s)]
*  there. This is complex. This is not the fault of a lesbian firefighter or the Ukraine or any of these [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2835.54s)]
*  other issues. This is leadership and nature and preparedness. So there are big issues around [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2841.86s)]
*  climate change. You want to believe me, you don't want to believe them. Fine. Put that aside. But [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2848.42s)]
*  I can tell you that when I saw Karen Bass, get off that flight, play the clip neck of Karen Bass [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2851.3s)]
*  here, because it's a short enough clip that we can play it here for the audience. I'm assuming [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2858.58s)]
*  you all three of you saw this clip of her being absolutely unwilling to answer a single goddamn [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2862.34s)]
*  question about what's going on. This is the opposite of leadership. Just 10 seconds of this [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2870.02s)]
*  being absent while their homes were burning. Do you regret cutting the fire department budget by [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2878.1s)]
*  millions of dollars, madam mayor? Have you nothing to say today? Have you absolutely nothing to say [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2883.54s)]
*  to the citizens today? Disgraceful. I mean, I have zero sympathy. You took the leadership job. I don't [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2892.66s)]
*  give a shit if you're in shock. You're a leader. You just you sold yourself as the leader that you [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2901.22s)]
*  were going to service these people and you don't have the dignity, the honor to just answer the [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2906.66s)]
*  questions. It is the that is absolutely the worst leadership I've ever seen under fire. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2912.2599999999998s)]
*  Let me ask you guys a question. Disgraceful. What do we do? [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2919.94s)]
*  You fire them all and you vote for a recruso. You vote for executives who know what the fuck [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2923.54s)]
*  they're doing and know what to do in a crisis because they've been under fire before, because [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2928.7400000000002s)]
*  they've run a business before, because they've seen the fan. This person, I don't know her. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2933.1400000000003s)]
*  I don't know her history, but I'll be totally honest. Like I wouldn't trust her literally to [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2938.1800000000003s)]
*  pick up my lunch. If she can't answer one or two goddamn questions and give a placating answer to [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2943.6200000000003s)]
*  a reporter, hey, it's an intense situation. We're working as hard as we can. She can't even say [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2948.98s)]
*  two goddamn words to the people who voted her in. And for anybody who voted for this level of [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2954.42s)]
*  incompetence reminds me of exactly what we went through in San Francisco when I was living there [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2959.06s)]
*  in the Bay Area. When you put someone like Chesa Boudin in or London breed or this entire clown [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2963.14s)]
*  car, Aaron Petsker, all these disgraceful discrepancy, the Marxist, the Marxist lunatics who would [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2969.38s)]
*  rather a virtue signal, dopey Dean Creston, the whole lot of them, you vote them out and you vote [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2975.86s)]
*  in executives and it doesn't mean a Republican executive. It doesn't mean a Democrat executive. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2981.38s)]
*  It means an executive who's run something in their life before, whether it's Bloomberg, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2985.6200000000003s)]
*  whether it's Trump, whether it's Rick Crusoe, it doesn't matter their ideology. It matters [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2990.02s)]
*  their effectiveness. And if you vote for ineffective people, you're going to get situations like this [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2993.6200000000003s)]
*  over and over and over again. So use your brains and vote for executives who've done something in [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=2998.1s)]
*  the world. This is why I've changed my position on rooting for Trump. Now I was a never Trump [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3003.3s)]
*  or everybody knows that, but he put executives around him this time around. And I am rooting [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3008.1800000000003s)]
*  for those executives to do what's right for the American people and solve big problems, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3012.7400000000002s)]
*  not make them worse. It's infuriating. Timoth, what do you think? [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3017.2200000000003s)]
*  I think we need to have a wholesale replacement of the people that govern the state of California. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3022.98s)]
*  It's just not working. And I think that the citizens that live in California need to do [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3028.7400000000002s)]
*  some real soul searching. It is beyond party politics. So I think what has happened in [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3035.78s)]
*  California is people vote for whatever vessel has the name Democrat beside their name or Republican [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3043.38s)]
*  beside their name. And I think that you have to go back to first principles and do a better job [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3050.42s)]
*  of picking the people to represent us because the people that are in positions of power [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3056.98s)]
*  just don't fundamentally know what they're doing. They're not capable. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3062.1s)]
*  And the fact that then what we have to deal with are sort of lies and distractions to excuse [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3067.14s)]
*  incompetence, I think is unacceptable. I think we pay way too high of a price. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3074.7400000000002s)]
*  And like I said, you are now dealing with hundreds of thousands of families whose [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3081.94s)]
*  entire lives have been totally disrupted and ripped away. And I hope that we learn something [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3086.18s)]
*  from this because we didn't learn from it eight years ago. And we clearly didn't learn from it [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3093.38s)]
*  when a different natural disaster in North Carolina, will we find out that folks said, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3099.54s)]
*  Hey guys, is there an outlier natural disaster event? Obviously, it's not going to be the same [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3104.2599999999998s)]
*  thing in North Carolina, but could a different form of something happen here? What could it be? [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3109.14s)]
*  Are we prepared? I'm sure we'll find out that they didn't do that. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3113.7s)]
*  Maybe they had different meetings and they were all about other total distractions or [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3117.54s)]
*  things that just didn't matter. So this is what we need to do. We as a populace in this state [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3123.8599999999997s)]
*  need a reset. Otherwise, we deserve what we get. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3130.8199999999997s)]
*  Bingo. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3134.02s)]
*  Sian, you agree? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3135.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think Democrats need to reclaim their party. I think there's a lot more strength [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3136.5s)]
*  in the middle. And they've let this woke ideology, I call it woke imperialism, like a religion, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3141.14s)]
*  take over in place of actually doing things that matter to the people that elected them, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3152.02s)]
*  that pay taxes, that pay their paychecks and everything in between. And it's time that [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3158.5s)]
*  people really look in the mirror. I've got so many moderates coming to me saying, [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3164.02s)]
*  you know, people call me a Republican and I'm far right and I'm a Nazi and I'm like, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3167.62s)]
*  yeah, welcome to the club. You know, it's at some point, you've got to stop letting them run the [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3171.78s)]
*  board and stand up and say, you know, enough's enough. You know, we're not building some railway [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3176.58s)]
*  that's never being built. We're not solving homelessness with billions and billions of dollars. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3182.1s)]
*  We're not doing this stuff anymore. You know, we do need real executives to your point, Jason, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3186.7400000000002s)]
*  and, you know, to run things that understand how things are, how it works and, you know, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3192.42s)]
*  the best use of funds. Because right now it's misappropriated. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3198.66s)]
*  Aaron Norris It's a crisis of competence. I mean, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3202.58s)]
*  I think we all see it. These are incompetent people. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3205.2200000000003s)]
*  Jason Tate By the way, it's not just the leadership, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3207.3s)]
*  it's also legislative action that's going to be needed to fix a lot of the policies, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3210.26s)]
*  the regulations, the way infrastructure operates in the state. And that requires three things to [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3216.66s)]
*  change. Number one is the California State Assembly. Number two is the California State [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3221.86s)]
*  Senate. And number three is to put things in front of the voters that they can vote on to [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3227.06s)]
*  make the wholesale change needed to rescind some of the bad decisions that were made over the last [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3232.1800000000003s)]
*  three decades in the state that has led us to this point. And I think that it's going to require, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3236.82s)]
*  just like what happened recently in the national politics, a state politics, organizational effort [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3241.78s)]
*  to say, let's take a look at the composition of the state assembly, the state senate, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3248.1s)]
*  and what are some of the votes that need to be done by the citizens to make the necessary changes [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3252.5s)]
*  in the state to try and get the world's fifth largest economy to start out acting and looking [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3257.7799999999997s)]
*  like it. Because right now it's sort of like a weirdly disabled third world country type operation [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3262.74s)]
*  with the wealthiest resources on planet Earth. And it seems pretty fucked up. It's almost like once [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3269.14s)]
*  people have it all, that's when they want to give it all up. That seems to be the moment that [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3274.58s)]
*  the state has just passed. Now maybe it's time to go reclaim it and build it back. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3278.58s)]
*  Well said. I mean, and as we said in this segment, there are so many common sense, tactical, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3282.58s)]
*  strategic things that these people could be doing that they should be doing that they're not. And [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3290.02s)]
*  there needs to be a full blown investigation. You kind of alluded to this earlier Chamath, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3296.18s)]
*  but if there is if this is dereliction of duty, then we need to look into this in a very deep [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3300.82s)]
*  fashion. And to the people of California, you have more power than you know. My friend who used to be [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3306.26s)]
*  on this podcast once in a while, he and I collaborated on Chesa Boudin being taken out as this DA in the [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3310.98s)]
*  Bay Area. I know some other people here were involved in it as well. And you can recall somebody. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3318.82s)]
*  So recall these incompetent lunatics, recall them and replace them. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3324.98s)]
*  It's scary, but you can. You know, they send all their people after you. They threaten you. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3328.98s)]
*  It gets personal. They went after you. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3334.5s)]
*  It gets, I was signature number one. And I had to deal with the deluge of that stuff. But to be [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3335.78s)]
*  honest with you, I've never been happier to do something and get civically engaged. I think it's [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3340.18s)]
*  so important that everybody starts getting involved in their local government and their state government [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3345.14s)]
*  and the national government, because you can't just expect people to do the work for you [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3350.1s)]
*  and expect it to turn out well. And I think that's kind of the mistake we all made. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3354.74s)]
*  We want to take some responsibility. The tech industry as a whole did not get as involved as [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3360.1s)]
*  we ought to have in the past. And I think we should get more involved. Why was that saying? [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3365.06s)]
*  Why did for 20 years while we were all in the Bay Area or other people, you know, just too busy [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3369.14s)]
*  building companies and it didn't seem- I think we were busy building companies. And I remember, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3375.06s)]
*  if I remember correctly, the only person I remember getting involved in local stuff was [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3377.7799999999997s)]
*  Ron Conway. And he would try to get everybody involved. And we were all just like, you know, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3383.54s)]
*  there's people who are smart that do that sort of thing, and they're going to do their thing, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3389.54s)]
*  and they're running stuff. And we're just not going to get involved. And a lot of people would [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3392.9s)]
*  say, I'm not political. I don't do politics. They didn't get involved until it affected them, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3396.5s)]
*  kind of like the houses burning down. It affects them. And like they're saying, at first they came [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3403.22s)]
*  for so-and-so, and I didn't speak up. You know, that's what's happening here. And, you know, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3409.46s)]
*  I just really think that people need to realize it's now affecting them and it's now time to make a [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3414.98s)]
*  change and elect better leaders. Here's a framing. If you're paying 50% tax in California, you're a [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3419.94s)]
*  shareholder of an organization known as California, Inc. You're on the board of that company. You're [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3427.2200000000003s)]
*  paying the salaries of the people there. You have a say. Recall these people, start a recall of [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3431.78s)]
*  Newsom, start a recall of Karen Bass. Just do it. I'm not doing it. I don't have time for this. I'm [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3437.38s)]
*  in Austin. But y'all who are still in California, start a page, recall Newsom, recall Bass, and you [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3441.7000000000003s)]
*  have the power to do it and you will succeed. I guarantee it. Now is the moment to strike. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3448.02s)]
*  There's other news we should get to. You know, I hate to say thoughts and prayers, but literally [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3452.26s)]
*  I've been thinking about this, you know, all day long. And I have a lot of friends. My friend, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3457.38s)]
*  Mark Suster lost his home. I used to play cards with Jimmy Woods and, you know, I just feel terrible [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3462.1s)]
*  for everybody who's lost their homes and then their kids and their schools are burned down as [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3468.5s)]
*  well. All those great schools in Pacific Palisades are gone. I could see developers coming in and [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3472.42s)]
*  being like, dude, if I could buy all these lots for 80% off, I will. That's what's going to happen. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3476.2599999999998s)]
*  They're going to sit on them. Yeah. They're going to just sit on them and wait for people to forget [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3481.06s)]
*  like they did in 1962. Rick Caruso of the world will do that. Yeah. Anyway. Yeah. He should be [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3484.18s)]
*  running the place. I'll give you another California Department of Insurance stat. So [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3490.34s)]
*  after the California Department of Insurance wouldn't allow the rates to rise like they should [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3494.5s)]
*  from a free market perspective, they had to set up their own insurance program called the Fair Plan [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3499.6200000000003s)]
*  for homeowners. It has about $220 million of capital in it. And then they bought about $5 [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3504.26s)]
*  billion of reinsurance. They have about 6 billion of exposure in Pacific Palisades alone. This is a [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3509.3s)]
*  bankrupt, just like I told you guys about in Florida, the state insurance commission tries [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3515.7000000000003s)]
*  to step in and fill the market gap that they create by regulating rates. And then they don't [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3519.46s)]
*  have enough capital to actually fill the gap because the reason the rates want to go up [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3523.7s)]
*  is because the thing costs more than the state is willing to admit. They're distorting it. They're [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3527.62s)]
*  putting their thumbs on the scale and they're distorting it even more. They're driving real [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3531.62s)]
*  estate value up because they're not allowing the cost of insurance of that real estate to naturally [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3536.98s)]
*  float. And so by driving real estate values up, the economy looks good. They make property taxes, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3542.5s)]
*  income comes in, but at the end of the day, the bill is going to come due. And in the case of [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3547.7s)]
*  Florida and in the case of California, either the state government or the federal government's going [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3552.3399999999997s)]
*  to step in and pay the difference. And at some point, taxpayers are going to look at the fact [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3557.14s)]
*  that they're paying some percentage of their income to support someone else's home value. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3561.7799999999997s)]
*  And they're going to say enough is enough. And enough of these sorts of events start to happen. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3566.4199999999996s)]
*  And then the legislative change I think will happen that says, this, it doesn't make sense. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3570.74s)]
*  We have to make a change. And I think we're getting pretty close after the series of events. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3575.86s)]
*  All right. This has been an absolutely fantastic discussion. Let's move on to our next topic here. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3579.78s)]
*  Zuck just fired Metta's third party fact checkers and he is going to embrace the community notes [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3585.78s)]
*  model from Twitter slash X, which predates Elon's ownership of the platform and is an [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3591.38s)]
*  open source project for those folks who don't know. On Tuesday, he made the announcement [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3598.42s)]
*  in an Instagram video, he published a blog with a bunch of details. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3603.3s)]
*  And he made the signal that he was going to move the trust and safety team out of California, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3608.82s)]
*  which he feels maybe was too far to the left as we were just discussing in the previous story, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3615.1400000000003s)]
*  and move it to the great state of Texas. And here's a quote from his comments. In recent years, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3622.9s)]
*  we've developed increasingly complex systems to manage content across our platforms, partly in [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3631.22s)]
*  response to societal and political pressures to moderate content. This approach has gone too far. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3636.02s)]
*  If you remember back in August, Zuck sent a letter to the House Judiciary Committee explaining how [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3642.02s)]
*  the FBI and Biden administration have pressured Facebook into censoring posts about COVID and [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3645.9399999999996s)]
*  Hunter Biden. You'll also remember that Zuckerberg has over 3 billion members to his platform and had [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3651.22s)]
*  no problem banning Trump from the platform after January 6. A lot to talk about in this topic, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3658.9s)]
*  Cyan. What's your general take of Zuck going MAGA? How do you interpret his change of heart? [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3666.1s)]
*  I actually think deep down inside, he always has been. I go back to the beginning days of Facebook [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3676.1s)]
*  and when there was social networks that were competing, which back at the time was MySpace, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3681.7000000000003s)]
*  the only political party you could be was Republican or Democrat. And then along came [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3686.34s)]
*  Facebook and he added this third option called Libertarian. And I would like to go to the way [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3691.38s)]
*  back machine at some point and find his profile because his profile said he was a Libertarian. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3696.34s)]
*  So when he started Facebook, that's where he leaned. So I think he's always been a free [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3701.06s)]
*  speech person. I think he's always, this has been deep in his heart. I think what happened was he [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3706.58s)]
*  had enormous success. They grew very large and he had to become neutral, or he thought he did. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3710.9s)]
*  And so I think what we're seeing with Zuck right now with his change in his, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3716.34s)]
*  you know, even how he appears with a gold chain and how he's dressing and everything that he's [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3721.62s)]
*  doing is him going back to his roots to be more authentic. Because I think he hasn't been authentic [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3726.5s)]
*  for a long time. And that was a big critique that people had of him. You know, they were just like [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3731.14s)]
*  when he talks, he's like a robot. And I think what we're seeing is him coming out of his shell. And [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3735.14s)]
*  I don't know if fighting helped it or what helped it. But, you know, I do think it's the best thing [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3740.34s)]
*  to do and all the platforms need to do it and should embrace it. And it can be game though, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3745.46s)]
*  community notes can be game that we saw it with. I saw a report that, you know, Kamala's campaign [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3750.9s)]
*  or I don't know, they directly work for her or what happened, but they did take over community notes [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3756.82s)]
*  on X and started manipulating them. So you have to be really careful, you know, how you run a [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3762.9s)]
*  community. But in general, I'm all for it. I think it's the right move. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3767.78s)]
*  It's but one signal. It's one system for trying to get to the truth. It's not the only one fact [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3771.3s)]
*  checking is another one. And having no system is another one. Chamath, you're obviously an alumni, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3775.7000000000003s)]
*  you worked side by side with Zuckerberg in the pivotal years of building the Facebook platform. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3780.34s)]
*  What's your take on what Cyan said? And what do you attribute Zuckerberg's massive 180 here? [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3786.26s)]
*  I would start by saying I think he's a phenomenal businessman. I mean, I think the [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3793.3s)]
*  results speak for itself. But I also think that that is exactly what explains the shift. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3797.94s)]
*  In many ways, he had to make that shift. I think it's fair to say that in the Obama and Biden [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3804.9s)]
*  administrations, when the winds were blowing towards censorship, they were part of that [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3811.3s)]
*  machinery. And that was the value maximizing function for Facebook shareholders in that time. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3818.26s)]
*  Because if you push back against that, it's not clear what would have happened to Facebook in [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3824.9s)]
*  other ways. And so I think the decision, whether he morally agreed with it or not, almost didn't [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3829.3s)]
*  matter. It's the leadership of the country in which I operate is telling me it's going to go this way, [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3837.0600000000004s)]
*  I go that way. Once the Biden and Obama administration sort of went to the wayside, [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3841.7000000000003s)]
*  there's a very interesting picture that Donald Trump put in his book. And I sent it to Nick. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3846.9s)]
*  And I think it sort of explains the last week's events relatively well. So I'll just read it. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3853.94s)]
*  This is a picture of him sitting in the Oval and it says, Mark Zuckerberg would come to the Oval [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3860.02s)]
*  office to see me. He would bring his very nice wife to dinners, be as nice as anyone could be, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3864.02s)]
*  while always plotting to install shameful lock boxes in a true plot against the president in [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3870.1800000000003s)]
*  J. Cal all caps. Okay. Shout out to the president. He told me that there was nobody like Trump on [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3875.3s)]
*  Facebook, but at the same time, and for whatever reason steered it against me. We are watching him [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3881.86s)]
*  closely and if he does anything illegal this time, he will spend the rest of his life in prison, [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3887.46s)]
*  as will others who cheat in the 2024 presidential election. Now that's what he put in the book. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3892.5s)]
*  And then he was asked about this quote at a recent press conference. Nick, do you have the [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3897.6200000000003s)]
*  link to that? He's colorful, Freiburg. Did you notice Donald Trump a little bit colorful? [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3903.3799999999997s)]
*  Essentially, Trump was asked about Zuckerberg's move to free speech. And he was asked, do you [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3908.2599999999998s)]
*  think it was because of your threat? And he goes, yeah, probably. Well, I watched their news [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3917.8599999999997s)]
*  conference and I thought it was a very good news conference. I think they've honestly, I think [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3924.02s)]
*  they've come a long way, meta. I think he's directly responding to the threats that you have [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3928.3399999999997s)]
*  made to him in the past. Probably. Wow, there it is. But again, the lens that I would put on this is [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3932.5s)]
*  now the winds are blowing in a different direction. And I do think it's the value [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3942.02s)]
*  maximizing function. I think Elon didn't make a value maximizing function. He made a moral decision. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3945.54s)]
*  He did it when it was unpopular and where the winds were clearly blowing in the opposite direction. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3951.7s)]
*  Now that those winds have changed and it's clear Trump won in early November, the decisions you [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3956.42s)]
*  make in January are more reflective of the new conditions on the field coming into the inauguration. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3961.3s)]
*  But I do think it's the smart value maximizing decision yet again for Facebook shareholders. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3966.6600000000003s)]
*  And I think it begets a broader point. I think the thing is when you see Elon operate, [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3972.34s)]
*  he's a complete outlier in many dimensions. But I think the one dimension where it matters the most [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3979.54s)]
*  is that he acts morally and in the best interests of what he believes humanity benefits from. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3984.34s)]
*  He's always done it. He was willing to torch $44 billion when he bought Twitter in order to do it. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3992.02s)]
*  And so he does these things from his own perspective. I don't think there's any other [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3997.7000000000003s)]
*  CEO that leads this way. And I don't think they should necessarily. I do think that, you know, [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4001.6200000000003s)]
*  Mark's a good person, but his intimate feelings should be known by his wife, his children, [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4007.3s)]
*  his friends, his family. I don't think we as shareholders have any right to know necessarily. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4013.7s)]
*  Elon is different. And I think it creates an expectation that maybe we'll get that from [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4018.74s)]
*  everybody else. But I wouldn't conflate everybody else with him. So I think that this is a smart [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4023.22s)]
*  business decision. It makes a ton of sense. And as you can see, he was basically told to do this. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4029.2999999999997s)]
*  So he complied free your thoughts on Zuckerberg. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4035.94s)]
*  Making this decision. If Kamala Harris had won, would he have released a statement or added Dana [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4041.86s)]
*  White to the board Facebook? Probably not. Okay, there you have it, folks. Pretty straightforward [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4049.22s)]
*  here. Kamala wins. He would not have done this. He is jumping in front of a marching band. And he [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4055.14s)]
*  is the band leader now. He's got his baton and he's a front runner. And if you open the dictionary [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4062.66s)]
*  and you look it up. But I mean, it's a smart business move. I think if you're a meta shareholder, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4068.3399999999997s)]
*  I think you're happy to see it. Absolutely. Is there anything wrong with it? J. Cal or you're [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4072.18s)]
*  just saying, Oh, yeah, there's a tremendous amount wrong with it. It's called moral integrity, having [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4076.58s)]
*  an ethical compass, having chutzpah, having an own sense of what's right and wrong in the world, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4080.42s)]
*  which he does not have in my estimation, based on his behavior. That's not fair. That's not fair. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4087.54s)]
*  You don't know because, again, what I'm saying is, I said based on my estimation, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4091.62s)]
*  nobody just know what I'm trying to say is, Elon shares who he is in a 360 degree way with the [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4096.0199999999995s)]
*  world. So we know where he stands. And all I'm saying is, what Mark does or doesn't believe really [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4102.82s)]
*  isn't known to us. It's probably known to his wife and his family and his board. I doubt his [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4108.26s)]
*  board even knows actually, some of his close confidants, some of his confidants, let me be [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4113.0599999999995s)]
*  clear. I'll leave in it's a happier challenge to me on it. I based people on their actions. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4117.38s)]
*  His action was to be the greatest sensor in the history of humanity. There's no human being who [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4123.46s)]
*  censored more humans than him. That was his decision when it was a popular decision, whether [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4127.9400000000005s)]
*  it was COVID or- Hold on, but not popular, not popular, Jason, necessary for maximizing his [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4132.66s)]
*  business in that moment. His business would have been just as vibrant if he had a spine and he just [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4138.5s)]
*  said, this is what I believe. And I think he's over optimizing based on what he thinks everybody [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4145.94s)]
*  else around him wants. And I don't know, I didn't, I've never worked with him. I don't know him [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4152.259999999999s)]
*  personally. You're right on that front. But he banned Trump for two years, the president, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4156.179999999999s)]
*  United States, I said at the time, I don't know that you can give a permanent brand ban to the [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4161.219999999999s)]
*  president, United States. When he had the opportunity to reevaluate that decision, you know what he did? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4165.219999999999s)]
*  He punted, he created a third party organization to make the decision for him and deflected. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4169.299999999999s)]
*  Zuck created the oversight board. He's so spineless, he decided I'll create and give [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4174.66s)]
*  $150 million to this board to make these hard decisions for me. Instead of me making the [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4178.9s)]
*  decision. He has God voting shares of that company Chamath. He controls it with an iron fist. And not [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4184.18s)]
*  only does he control with an iron fist, he has put protection of precisions in that so that his [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4190.42s)]
*  children could take that $3.3 billion platform and own it forever. And he punted to them and said, [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4194.58s)]
*  I don't want to make these decisions. What I saw when he did that was I don't want to be blamed for [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4200.98s)]
*  these decisions. And that is a lack of courage and morality in my estimation. And then the second he [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4205.0599999999995s)]
*  is threatened by Trump, he makes the opposite decision. And if he's making his decisions [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4212.179999999999s)]
*  strictly on maximizing money, I don't respect that. I think he should make the decisions based on what [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4216.98s)]
*  he thinks is the moral. What is the point of being a billionaire or worth $100 billion or $200 billion [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4222.179999999999s)]
*  if you don't get to say I have you money, you I'm going to do what I want. And that's what I think [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4227.7s)]
*  is the his moral failure. And anybody giving him his flowers or championing him for this. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4233.139999999999s)]
*  I think it's just political expediency. And I think it's disgraceful. That's my period. That's [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4238.179999999999s)]
*  my feeling. Sorry. I have my own opinion. What about the fact that he was dragged in front of [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4243.0599999999995s)]
*  Congress many times over, and people that could put him behind bars pulled him to his face many [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4248.42s)]
*  times and this has all been kind of been coming out over the last couple of months that government [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4254.26s)]
*  officials were directing him in a way that feels like do this or you will be prosecuted [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4258.34s)]
*  to do the following things to act the following way and to moderate your platform in a way [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4264.34s)]
*  that we are telling you to moderate it, or you will find yourself behind bars. Do you not think [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4268.34s)]
*  that there's some degree of inherent complicit kind of role that certain government officials [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4273.06s)]
*  and folks in power had in driving some of those actions that maybe he had to do it to survive and [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4277.860000000001s)]
*  to keep the company alive? Not to mention a violation of our constitution. No, not at all. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4282.82s)]
*  He could have just hired lawyers and fought it. He didn't put up any fight. The second they told [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4287.94s)]
*  him to roll over and ban Trump, he did it. Zero fight from him. He has no- Do you know that for [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4292.179999999999s)]
*  sure? Because I just want to make sure I ask you- I'm just basing it on his actions. Like I told you [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4299.0599999999995s)]
*  at the beginning of this, I'm basing it on his actions. Right. But I just want to make sure- He [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4302.66s)]
*  was not going to jail for banning Trump. If he didn't ban Trump or he gave him a six month [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4306.259999999999s)]
*  suspension, he would have been just fine. I'm just trying to get you to take a fair point of [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4310.34s)]
*  view, which means let's make sure you're thoughtful about the fact that this is not a dumb person, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4314.66s)]
*  or a person- Give him the benefit for a minute. He's not a dumb person- I'd give him the benefit [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4318.66s)]
*  of being a great business executive. I'm just saying, let's assume he's not dumb, and let's say [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4322.5s)]
*  that as Cyan points out, and as he's highlighted points in his history, he actually does have [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4326.34s)]
*  certain beliefs and certain systems that he would love to embrace. I've said this many times before. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4331.14s)]
*  All of the founders of the big tech companies were all big free speech advocates. That was a [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4336.1s)]
*  big part of the open internet and the movement of the open internet when a lot of people got [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4340.18s)]
*  involved. Yes, he was part of it. He was there. Yeah. And that was a big part for him. And I don't [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4343.38s)]
*  know if you really think at some point he flipped his switch and said, I don't care about the open [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4346.26s)]
*  internet. I now want to have a closed controlled internet. Or if he recognized or was coerced into [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4350.58s)]
*  controlling moderation on the platform because of the reach that he had. And he said, the only way [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4355.38s)]
*  I can have any degree of openness is to do the following. And I will say that my experience is [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4359.22s)]
*  similar in Google. When Google had to exit China, they initially went to China with a closed internet [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4363.46s)]
*  with a closed censored model of search, because that was the way they had to survive to offer a [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4368.74s)]
*  business in China. They didn't morally agree with it. They didn't think it was ethically correct. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4373.62s)]
*  Did they launch that or did Sergey kill the deal when Eric Schmidt proposed it? [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4377.78s)]
*  Well, that deal went live. Let me just make sure I get this all correct. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4381.46s)]
*  No, they didn't go live. Sergey Brin, because of his upbringing in Russia, he went to the mat and [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4384.9800000000005s)]
*  said on a moral basis, we're not going into China. And I've talked to Sergey about it. He did not [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4392.18s)]
*  want to go in there and compromise his own ethics. That's right. You're at full stop. So I don't think [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4397.06s)]
*  that you're the only outlier here. You're not right. And I just want to make sure that when did it when [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4402.900000000001s)]
*  did the dragon it was called Project Dragon. There was a there's a long history to this. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4408.26s)]
*  Okay, let's let Cyan come in here. I want to make sure I get this right. But go ahead, Cyan. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4413.22s)]
*  Obviously, he's a brilliant businessman. But I do think underneath it all, he is a human being. And [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4416.740000000001s)]
*  I think his fighting in the arena and this fighting stuff that he does actually did change him. And [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4421.22s)]
*  this happened long before the First Amendment stuff started to appear. You know, I think [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4425.780000000001s)]
*  our free speech, I shouldn't call it First Amendment. But I do think that the government [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4432.18s)]
*  did interfere. And after January 20, we're going to find out some interesting stuff. And we'll get [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4435.14s)]
*  to the bottom of, you know, how did the government pressure him to censor things? And I think he's [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4440.34s)]
*  getting in front of that because it is going to come out. And I think that is a huge part of [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4448.02s)]
*  why he is getting more involved is because it's going to be revealed just how much the government [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4453.3s)]
*  coerced him. And how much he acquiesced? Is that sort of what you're saying? [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4458.740000000001s)]
*  This is why I think the fighting actually helped. I think he learned to stop acquiescing. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4463.14s)]
*  Wow. I actually think that he put up a fight. That is where I started seeing the change in him [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4466.5s)]
*  and started noticing and so did they'll you know, he's so many more fans and people who are [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4471.46s)]
*  looking to him as a leader in a different way now because he's actually starting to express who he is. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4476.580000000001s)]
*  And like what kind of music he likes. Nobody ever knew that. They thought he was just a robot. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4481.46s)]
*  He doesn't like music. He hired a whole PR team to craft this is my understanding. But anyway, [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4485.46s)]
*  I don't know that much detail. I don't I'm not involved in his personal life like that. But I [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4490.18s)]
*  just I always love to give people the benefit of data. I guess that's just me. And I do think that [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4495.46s)]
*  people can change. And I'm hoping that he is actually going to stay on this side. We [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4501.14s)]
*  want more leaders like him to believe in free speech. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4506.5s)]
*  Of course. Of course. I mean, listen, Reddit had by the way, they all do. And I've never met [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4509.14s)]
*  an internet business executive who didn't come from kind of the open internet philosophical [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4515.62s)]
*  doctrine by background. But that was a big motivator for all of us because the internet [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4521.38s)]
*  took away the controls, took away the power, took away the censorship, took away all these things [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4526.1s)]
*  that other kind of communication systems had vested in them. And the internet through an open [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4531.22s)]
*  protocol allowed anyone to share anything with anyone else. And obviously, laws and all this [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4535.780000000001s)]
*  other stuff that's happened since then has made that far more difficult. And I will revisit our [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4540.5s)]
*  conversation, Jason. Google's China with censored search results was live for four years before they [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4545.3s)]
*  canceled it. So they launched in 2006, they censored results, they complied with the Chinese [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4550.5s)]
*  government's requests. And eventually in 2010, they killed it. And you could argue it was because [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4555.54s)]
*  of philosophical reasons, but fundamentally never actually got a lot of users in China. There were [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4559.38s)]
*  more users on Baidu. And Google had separately made an investment. Gmail was the moment I think it [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4564.1s)]
*  became, if I remember correctly, 20 years ago, but I think I think it was YouTube, was it YouTube? [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4569.78s)]
*  Because one of the other services they started saying, Hey, we need to know these people's names [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4574.98s)]
*  who posted this who sent this email, we want full access into it. And that's where they drew the [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4579.94s)]
*  line because it wasn't just a passive search engine, right? It was actually like roundup [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4584.0199999999995s)]
*  dissidents like Yahoo, famously did Yahoo, they Google claimed there was a hack that happened [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4587.94s)]
*  because on their servers in China, and so they were just no longer comfortable about this guy's. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4594.9s)]
*  However, we got here. We're here. And we should all be happy that we're here. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4600.5s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah, I'll take the win. And we just kind of move forward. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4607.14s)]
*  Top of that. I mean, taking the win is a good way to do it. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4610.9800000000005s)]
*  The world is a better place because of his decision. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4612.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. I think we all agree on that. I mean, what's the point of having an open [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4615.38s)]
*  platform and you can say things. But why do you call them spineless? Like why go after the guy? [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4619.780000000001s)]
*  Because you can judge a person when they're put under pressure to make the right decision. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4624.34s)]
*  I think what Jason is expressing is sort of what I was trying to say. And I probably said it poorly. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4628.740000000001s)]
*  I think there are some of us who look at the way that Elon runs himself in his companies, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4632.58s)]
*  as a sort of world beating technology CEO. And then that sort of sets the bar. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4641.22s)]
*  But I think that that bar is impossible to meet. And I think part of it is because of Elon's genius. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4649.14s)]
*  The other part of it is his success. The other part of it is his influence. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4655.54s)]
*  But there's an element, Jason, a fundamental moral risk taking that he takes that has been [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4659.22s)]
*  rewarded over and over again, that no other CEO has had to make. And when they have, [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4665.3s)]
*  they've largely failed. And so I understand where you're coming from. But I would give [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4670.34s)]
*  a lot of folks the benefit of the doubt here and say, it's not clear what they believe then versus [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4675.3s)]
*  what they believe now. But the destination is very good. And we're in a better place for society. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4680.740000000001s)]
*  And hopefully we can maintain these norms, independent of who's in charge after Trump. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4686.58s)]
*  Hi, I'm super happy he's making these decisions. I believe in freedom of speech. I think he's going [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4692.42s)]
*  to have to deal with advertisers next though. I mean, that's one thing that X doesn't have to [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4697.54s)]
*  deal with as much. And that's going to be the second problem he's going to have is not just [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4700.82s)]
*  the government. But do advertisers want to be next to some of the content that's about to appear? [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4704.9s)]
*  And when he loses 10s of billions of dollars in personal net worth, will he make the same decisions? [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4710.18s)]
*  We'll see. But I can tell you if Kamala Harris had been voted in, he would double down on [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4715.22s)]
*  censorship instead of taking this position. I think he is terrified of Trump and having his [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4721.22s)]
*  company broken up. And he's doing this strictly to appease Trump, which I think putting Dana [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4725.860000000001s)]
*  White on the board is another signal. That's one of Trump's good friends. He's just trying to get [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4731.06s)]
*  close to the party. He's trying to make up for lost time for when he supported the censorship [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4734.900000000001s)]
*  of Trump and other folks. I think he would make the opposite decision. But to your point, we're [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4740.34s)]
*  here. I'm glad you said would you would you meet Zuck in the octagon? That's the most important [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4744.74s)]
*  question? No, no, definitely not. He's got his his 1015 years younger than me. He killed me. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4749.62s)]
*  Not a not a chance when I meet him in the octagon. But I wish him well. I wish him well. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4756.34s)]
*  Would you meet Palmer Lucky in the octagon? Let's not start. And we just wondering, just wondering, [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4761.0599999999995s)]
*  just wondering, I actually literally challenged him. He's he wanted to send the mountain he wanted [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4766.74s)]
*  to pick somebody to fight for him Trey from Founders Fund. And I said no, unless Trey was [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4771.06s)]
*  I would like I would you guys ever watch the old TV show American gladiators? I would like I would [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4777.620000000001s)]
*  like you and Palmer to have an American gladiator style tournament, like maybe four or five events, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4782.9800000000005s)]
*  and you know, you kind of get that would be incredible. Put up a million dollars for charity. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4788.18s)]
*  I'll totally do it. We'll put up a million dollars each for charity. I'll do it. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4792.18s)]
*  I mean, let's let's get you know, let's get the put a chart out there. I think that this could be [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4797.0599999999995s)]
*  let's say something super world positive here more exciting than the accelerator, I will tell you. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4802.34s)]
*  We did. Absolutely might get more ratings than it. Yeah. You could actually call it you could call [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4807.0599999999995s)]
*  it American gladiators. It would be a great American gladiators, the CEO edition, business to business [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4811.3s)]
*  edition. Going fast. All right, listen, Nvidia going consumer. Let's talk about it. Nvidia made [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4816.58s)]
*  a big announcement at CES this week. They've had a lot of them. One of them that was particularly [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4822.74s)]
*  interesting was this $3,000 personal AI computer for researchers. It's called project digits. And [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4826.42s)]
*  it's essentially like maybe Arduino would be a way to look at this like a personal device, [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4834.0199999999995s)]
*  but it's powerful enough to run LLMs on they're also going after physical AI, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4840.82s)]
*  like robotics and self driving, as we said here on the award show, a lot of people on the panel [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4846.179999999999s)]
*  were predicting this year would be the year of robotics and they announced that they're going to [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4850.82s)]
*  have driver assistant chips and maybe build worlds for people to simulate, which net net at the end [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4854.82s)]
*  of the day, I think free broke puts them on second, it would put autonomy partners on second or third [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4862.58s)]
*  base in terms of creating technology by incorporating it into the chips and into their stack. So, [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4867.46s)]
*  Cyan, what do you think of these announcements and some of the other ones he made? I know you were [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4873.38s)]
*  excited to talk about this. Yeah, I'm really excited to talk about it because I think I've [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4878.34s)]
*  been trying to figure out how they justify their valuation over the long run. And, you know, I'm [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4881.54s)]
*  not a public market person, but I am fascinated with Nvidia. And, you know, their cloud GPU [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4887.38s)]
*  business is definitely a majority of their revenue. So I think a lot of what we're seeing is them [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4893.860000000001s)]
*  trying to grow into that and trying to expand in case, you know, the music stopped. Now, I don't [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4900.18s)]
*  actually think the music's going to stop. You know, it's insane to me. We haven't even barely [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4905.22s)]
*  touched what AI is going to do and change and all of the various things that are going to come from [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4912.1s)]
*  it. And, you know, the early adopters cannot use cloud without getting shut down because of scaling [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4916.820000000001s)]
*  issues. And I don't think those are artificially created based on the type of investing I'm doing. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4922.9800000000005s)]
*  And so I'm very bullish on Nvidia. It is interesting. It's an interesting thing to go consumer. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4927.46s)]
*  And, you know, the thing that really hit me was the fact that he kind of declared Tesla one of the [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4934.900000000001s)]
*  most valuable companies in the world in the long run. It's interesting that he got behind [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4941.38s)]
*  Toyota. But at the same time, you know, I don't think of a there's one single car company out [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4947.54s)]
*  there that has the kind of data that Full Self Drive has and Tesla has. So if they enter the [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4953.700000000001s)]
*  robo taxi market, I actually think they should buy Uber, then it's kind of you should. Tesla [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4959.3s)]
*  should buy Uber. Oh, yeah, I think they should buy Uber. That would be about 10% of Tesla's [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4963.86s)]
*  market cap at this point. If they paid a premium, it might be 15%. So it would be very similar. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4967.7s)]
*  But it's true. Yeah, it is true. Yeah. And then and then you launch that robo taxi service. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4972.58s)]
*  And, you know, maybe there's some sort of secondary aftermarket solution kind of like comma AI or [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4978.42s)]
*  something like that that you can do for people's cars. Where you can actually get anybody's car [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4983.46s)]
*  into the fleet and start self driving. But it is true, this is going to be the largest breakout [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4988.58s)]
*  in robotics we've ever seen. If Waymo is any indicator. And, you know, I read somewhere, [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4993.7s)]
*  I think that Amazon or some somebody was looking at it. I don't know what was going on with Waymo. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5000.26s)]
*  But I'll lift Amazon was gonna buy lift. Yeah, that makes no sense. Right. Why would you buy [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5004.58s)]
*  with the point be? I do think you're correct. I think maybe delivery or something like that. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5012.42s)]
*  I can't figure out what their play is there. Well, it's not. And it's also not global. But, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5017.78s)]
*  you know, looking at the Amazon and Waymo, Tesla and Uber, I think Waymo plus Uber, [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5021.78s)]
*  Amazon plus Uber, or Tesla plus Uber defines who number one is, right? Because you'd have a global [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5028.259999999999s)]
*  footprint. And for the five 10 years, maybe 10 years it takes to roll out taxis globally. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5033.86s)]
*  You could have people driving. It's a really interesting thought process you have to say. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5039.219999999999s)]
*  Imagine if there was an interim area step where they sold less Tesla's this year, slightly than [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5042.9s)]
*  last year, you could just keep producing lots of model wise, and give them to the Uber drivers, [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5048.0199999999995s)]
*  keep reinforcement learning going, while the taxis and regulations get set. And then you would be [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5054.18s)]
*  able to put another instead of selling 1.8 million testers, you could sell 3 million testers, 4 [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5060.98s)]
*  million testers to Uber drivers, get all that data and have the safety driver and while each region [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5066.42s)]
*  decides if they want robot taxis, where, how, etc. Your thoughts, Shamath, on Nvidia's dipping [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5072.02s)]
*  their toe into maybe taking the bottom 30% of the stack of self driving. I don't have much of an [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5078.740000000001s)]
*  opinion on that, to be honest. I think that sort of along the lines of what I said on the prediction [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5084.26s)]
*  show, I think that Waymo and Tesla are going to run away with this market. And I think it's going [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5088.820000000001s)]
*  to force a bunch of consolidation in the traditional auto OEMs. I think the interesting thing is that [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5093.14s)]
*  they really doubled down and created a pretty decent test bench for robotics. I thought that [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5099.7s)]
*  was pretty interesting. So I think that reinforces what a lot of smart people, including, you know, [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5105.78s)]
*  what Freeberg and Gavin also spoke about just in terms of the long term future for robots. I think [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5111.0599999999995s)]
*  that that was cool. I was a little confused by the low end PC. I don't understand what the point of [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5116.74s)]
*  that is. Maybe it like creates some crazy deep in market where you can buy GPU and then contribute [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5124.42s)]
*  it to some distributed network and allow some distributed workload to run on that, I guess, [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5132.74s)]
*  I don't know. I think it's a toy, a hobbyist kind of device that becomes like a bridge. And we see [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5137.139999999999s)]
*  this often in technology where some buddy creates like even the original PCs, let's face it, they [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5144.259999999999s)]
*  were kind of like toys and hobbyist devices, Arduinos and the original drones were kind of [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5149.22s)]
*  hobbyist. Yeah, I guess the point is a toy to do what because if you're trying to do inference, [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5154.18s)]
*  everything is telling us that we are reaching the limits of training. And that's an LL. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5160.820000000001s)]
*  Right. The point is, it's not. Yeah. Let me get to it. So in this world of AI that we know it [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5169.06s)]
*  today, there's training and there's inference. And right now we think that there's training that's [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5175.3s)]
*  at a limit. And so now the market shifts to inference. So if you're going to buy this [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5179.3s)]
*  jacked up personal computer, what are you going to use it for? My suspicion is some sort of test [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5185.14s)]
*  time compute use case, which is an inference use case. But it's not clear to me why that's a better [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5190.34s)]
*  solution than all of the AI accelerators plus tensors that are now just prolifically being [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5198.18s)]
*  exposed to the market, whether it's Amazon exposing what they've done, whether it's Google exposing [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5206.1s)]
*  what they've done, a whole litany of startups exposing what they've done. So I was just confused. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5211.38s)]
*  I don't really know what the whole point is. What do you think? But like I said, the robotics thing [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5217.3s)]
*  was interesting if the market develops in the way that they think. So we're talking about maybe two [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5224.1s)]
*  or three different pieces here. Free bird. Which one do you think is super interesting? The this [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5228.820000000001s)]
*  $3,000 sort of GPU for your desktop that you attach to your computer, you get to play with [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5234.18s)]
*  things locally. Do you think that's promising? Where would that go? If you have to guess? [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5240.26s)]
*  So I think the bet he's making is it's not just LLM, which is predicting text. But, you know, [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5244.18s)]
*  we've talked a lot about machine vision models, graph neural nets that are being used for weather [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5251.7s)]
*  forecasting. There's now these kind of genome language models that are trying to predict genomic [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5258.26s)]
*  output for biotech applications. There's also going to be kind of real time [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5263.139999999999s)]
*  machine vision and robotic response. Like we're working on this at Ohalo, and we're trying to [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5270.66s)]
*  figure out what's the right kind of runtime environment for these sorts of systems that [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5276.42s)]
*  are going to be using machine vision and a robotic kind of response type system. And there's a lot of [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5280.26s)]
*  these industrial applications that are emerging. Let's say you're running a robot in a warehouse, [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5284.34s)]
*  do you really want that robot in the warehouse to be sending data to the cloud and waiting for a [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5288.58s)]
*  model to run in the cloud and getting a response? The probability is you want to have that at the [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5293.7s)]
*  edge of the network, you want to have something local. And I don't think he necessarily has a [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5298.5s)]
*  strong point of view on what the types of models and industrial applications will be. But the bet [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5302.900000000001s)]
*  he's making is that the models are good enough and now the chips are good enough that they can [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5307.94s)]
*  actually realize real time responses using machine vision, using real time input, and then respond [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5312.0199999999995s)]
*  quickly with a local model running whatever that model is to drive some output in the industrial [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5319.46s)]
*  setting. And that there'll be a lot of these sorts of applications, whether that's making predictions [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5324.419999999999s)]
*  for biotech research, or whether that's for running robots in warehouses, or building new research [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5328.9s)]
*  models. Or maybe you could strap this PC on the back of something like a car, a tractor, a lawnmower, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5334.9s)]
*  a humanoid robot, or any other set of applications. So I think that- [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5341.46s)]
*  Explain to the audience, Freberg, why having the computer at the edge is beneficial for those folks [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5344.42s)]
*  who might not know. If you're taking in a lot of data and then you have to run a lot of data in a [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5350.0199999999995s)]
*  model, it's a lot faster to run that model locally. Like when Tesla runs self-driving, [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5354.339999999999s)]
*  it's not sending the video images from your car to a server a thousand miles away and then [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5360.18s)]
*  letting the server decide how to drive your car. The car is running its model on what to do [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5365.780000000001s)]
*  with respect to the video imagery in the car. It's local because the ability for all that data to [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5370.58s)]
*  get processed in the car means that you don't have to wait for the internet to transmit data back and [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5376.02s)]
*  forth. You don't have lag time. You don't have the 60 millisecond or 100 millisecond response time. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5379.62s)]
*  You don't have it losing your phone connection and then not knowing what to do. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5383.860000000001s)]
*  Exactly. Or the connection drops or waiting for a server to come online or server breaks in the [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5387.22s)]
*  data center. Everything is local. So if you strap this like, you know, Nvidia computer, [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5392.42s)]
*  which is basically plug and play, you don't have to have like hardware expertise. You can [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5397.62s)]
*  strap it onto the back of a humanoid robot or run research applications locally. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5401.54s)]
*  So I think that there is going to be some really interesting use cases, whether it becomes a [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5406.02s)]
*  replacement for the Apple, you know, Macintosh Pro, studio device, whatever. Maybe we'll see. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5410.18s)]
*  Mac Mini 4, yeah. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5416.34s)]
*  The Mac Mini 4. But a lot of people have pointed out that actually the compute on this thing for [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5417.700000000001s)]
*  $3,000 knocks a lot of Macs out of the field. So it is pretty boggish. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5421.860000000001s)]
*  I just can't run an operating system in the traditional sense. Sam, when we look at startups, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5425.9400000000005s)]
*  I remember when you and I started investing, two of the driving forces was free storage, [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5430.820000000001s)]
*  free bandwidth, and cloud computing drove a lot of ability to get a product to market very quickly, [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5434.34s)]
*  effectively, etc. What impact will AI have on all these startups that are being [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5441.46s)]
*  originating now in 2024, 2025? Looking to your crystal ball and how do you think they'll grow [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5447.54s)]
*  the footprint of them? How is this going to accelerate the startup scene? [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5455.14s)]
*  I actually think we're going to see a Cambrian explosion of creativity and development of [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5458.9800000000005s)]
*  different things. And some of them are going to be stupid ideas and some of them are going to be [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5464.18s)]
*  great. But I think it's going to make our job, especially at the seed stage of investing harder [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5468.42s)]
*  and harder. There's just going to be a lot of people that have similar ideas at the same time [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5472.5s)]
*  that can execute quickly and do things that breakneck speeds that they've never been able [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5478.1s)]
*  to do before. So picking the winner is going to be hard to figure out. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5482.82s)]
*  It's going to be harder and harder. Yeah. And it might be that, I've been thinking about this, [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5487.9400000000005s)]
*  do you invest in competitors, which is something I never used to do? Do you take an index and [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5492.02s)]
*  entire category that you're interested in? What is the approach at seed and precede? Because [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5498.34s)]
*  I think of an idea and I'm like, wow, that's really neat. And then I go and look out there [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5504.02s)]
*  and there's 30 people working on it. And that didn't used to be the case. And I think part of [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5506.74s)]
*  it is we've really unlocked a tool that allows people to do things that would have been cost [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5512.26s)]
*  prohibitive or gives them the ability to think, gosh, I could be an entrepreneur and I can try [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5519.860000000001s)]
*  this and I could do this. So I'm seeing people experiment and do all sorts of things. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5524.26s)]
*  As far as the startups, some of the AI stuff is just a feature. It's just table stakes at this [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5530.02s)]
*  point. It's like a chat or whatever. And that doesn't really matter. But then you're seeing [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5536.74s)]
*  people reimagine games and reimagine even things down to your kitchen appliance, et cetera. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5540.58s)]
*  So I do think it's going to be very, very difficult. And I tend to set out a lot of [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5548.1s)]
*  hype cycles. So I invested in power and compute, lithography, kind of all of the things that are [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5553.7s)]
*  going to be underneath all of this. And so I'm not sure how much of it I'm going to participate in [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5561.3s)]
*  until it starts to get to a steady state and you kind of can understand what's next. Because the [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5567.46s)]
*  rate of acceleration is just so great that it's just kind of unclear to me sometimes, [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5572.5s)]
*  you know, especially when it comes to these consumer applications, consumer facing things. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5579.9400000000005s)]
*  It's just really hard. Well, when we were picking famously Uber, you had to pick between [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5583.860000000001s)]
*  Sikar, Lyft and Uber, there were three people doing it. And it was pretty clear who was the [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5589.860000000001s)]
*  most qualified amongst those three. Now, to your point, if you want to be involved in tax, plus [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5593.62s)]
*  AI or legal plus AI, you might be looking at 50 companies, 100. And it was tradition in Silicon [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5600.5s)]
*  Valley to not bet on competitors. There were some notable exceptions. When you run an accelerator, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5606.34s)]
*  like I do, Techstars or Y Combinator, you aren't bound by that because 50% of the companies pivot [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5610.66s)]
*  almost by design. So I think you just have to, I think, at pre-seed, because people pivot, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5615.54s)]
*  you just have to tell people, like, listen, we have a lot of pivoting going on, people are going to [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5622.42s)]
*  run into each other. I can't just bet on one thing, right? In a space. But I think that's a [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5625.3s)]
*  reasonable compromise. If all the founders are going to keep pivoting to each other's businesses, [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5630.26s)]
*  how can the investors even keep track of that? It's like being traffic control of [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5634.74s)]
*  10 airports at once. It's just not feasible. You wouldn't think it, but there's still a lot [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5638.82s)]
*  of spreadsheet companies out there. You think you'd run out of them, but they're still out there. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5644.0199999999995s)]
*  I think this is where AI is really going to make a difference. RFP proposals for governments, [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5650.42s)]
*  something that takes 30 days, and it's manual and you have to submit these horrible documents. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5654.98s)]
*  You can ingest your entire corpus of all of your previous bids and submit them at a breakneck speed [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5659.86s)]
*  now and win more contracts. That becomes like a national defense company at that point. And so I [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5666.42s)]
*  think we're going to see a lot of really interesting things where a lot of cruft is going to disappear. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5672.0199999999995s)]
*  And that'll be a really interesting wave that I'm looking forward to. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5679.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. In fact, Jamath has made a big bet there with his time with his [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5683.38s)]
*  software startup that he's created. All right, let's end on the United States of America growing [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5687.38s)]
*  from 50 to 60 or 70 states. Trump has been rattling off some ideas around this. Trump, [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5693.38s)]
*  what's your take on it? I know we've got to get wrapped up here, so we'll just do a quick [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5702.9800000000005s)]
*  lightning round on it. I mean, I thought it was really interesting. And I was just caught off [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5706.5s)]
*  guard at how the media tried to portray it as Trump being Trump. Goofy, whatever, colorful. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5712.1s)]
*  But I think what I've realized, even with the California fire thing, the guy has this prescient [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5719.860000000001s)]
*  way of... He may not say it in the way that it works for some people, but he's just really on [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5725.14s)]
*  top of this stuff. So I just said, Nick, a thing. So I started to learn a little bit more about why [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5730.820000000001s)]
*  he wants to take over Greenland. And it really comes down to one very basic idea here. Because [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5736.18s)]
*  of climate change and other things, the Arctic ice shelf is melting. And the more and more it melts, [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5743.54s)]
*  it opens up a shipping lane in the Northern Passage for a lot of critical goods. And so, [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5749.780000000001s)]
*  if you had some sort of strategic agreement with Canada and Greenland, you effectively have this [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5757.22s)]
*  monopoly control over something that could become as important as the Panama Canal. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5764.18s)]
*  And so, I think if you look across the world, the control of maritime shipping lanes becomes this [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5769.7s)]
*  really critical strategic military and economic asset. And so, the reason why he's trying to find [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5777.54s)]
*  a way to initiate some sort of a discussion between Greenland and Canada is exactly this reason. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5785.3s)]
*  And I think it's sort of like a bargaining gambit the way that he started. But it's really smart [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5791.46s)]
*  that he's trying to get this done for the United States of America. Because meanwhile, what you [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5796.5s)]
*  have is China militarizing very aggressively, Russia militarizing very aggressively. And what [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5801.06s)]
*  you don't want to have happen is those two countries take control of that Northern Passage [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5806.9s)]
*  as the ice sheet melts. So I just thought that was important. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5811.22s)]
*  Having a capable business executive thinking about the future of business and shipping and logistics, [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5814.42s)]
*  pretty big win. And I just love the idea, Sian. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5819.86s)]
*  You know what's smart? I mean, let's give Trump credit. What's so smart is somebody was doing this [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5822.9s)]
*  work, got it in front of him, and he was smart enough to say, hold on a second, this is really [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5827.38s)]
*  important. Let me tweet it. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5833.54s)]
*  And then the way that he initiates it, though, gets even more attention. Because if he basically [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5835.3s)]
*  tweeted, hey, guys, I have this really interesting idea to gain more leverage in a Northern [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5840.179999999999s)]
*  maritime shipping lane, nobody would have paid attention. Absolutely not. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5845.38s)]
*  Nobody would have. And now we're all talking about it. And now there's an opportunity for [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5848.74s)]
*  millions of people to understand why and be supportive of it. It's pretty smart. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5853.06s)]
*  Sian, any thoughts on expanding the United States to a couple more territories and states? [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5856.82s)]
*  I love it. I would love to have 60 states in our lifetime. I mean, let's pick one in the Caribbean. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5860.9800000000005s)]
*  Let's pick one in Europe. I think we should have an open invitation. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5866.5s)]
*  But Jason, that's not what he's doing. I think he's... [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5868.5s)]
*  I know I'm being a bit facetious here. I understand this is very strange. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5870.5s)]
*  This is very strategic, this one. But I'm just thinking the next domino. I would like to get Cuba, [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5874.660000000001s)]
*  maybe Portugal. I don't know who 80% of people, Sian, what do you think? [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5879.860000000001s)]
*  In the country want to join? [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5883.22s)]
*  It's very strategic. If you look at the Panama Canal, I believe [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5884.820000000001s)]
*  either end is operated and controlled by China. We are at war with China, whether we like to [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5888.580000000001s)]
*  admit it or not, in my opinion. And so this is very strategic. He has a very strange way of [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5893.9400000000005s)]
*  communicating, as you pointed out, but I think it's brilliant. And I actually think [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5900.1s)]
*  we should add to that. I've always thought that we should open up and add more states [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5904.1s)]
*  and extend that invitation to Taiwan. It might be controversial to even say India. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5910.02s)]
*  But I do think that there's a lot of countries out there and people who really, really resonate [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5916.42s)]
*  with what it means to be an American and the freedoms that come with our subscription fees. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5922.740000000001s)]
*  Of this country. And so I do think that it would be great for us to expand. And I don't know [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5929.860000000001s)]
*  what he's thinking or how he always got behind the scenes who motivated him to do it. But I [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5936.02s)]
*  really think it's a great idea. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5940.58s)]
*  Friedberg, what do you think about Hopped In imperialism [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5942.26s)]
*  and this incredible concept of expanding our territories in the 21st century? [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5947.46s)]
*  Again, I don't know how to read it. I have no inside information. There's clearly some [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5954.42s)]
*  posturing, as we've heard many times, when Trump makes a declaration like I'm going to put on 100% [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5958.02s)]
*  tariff on every car that's imported or I'm going to charge you 2000 bucks in Mexico for every time [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5962.580000000001s)]
*  you ship something here or I want to do X or Y or Z. It's not the literal statement that matters as [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5967.700000000001s)]
*  much as kind of the vector and the magnitude of the vector. He's clearly trying to begin negotiating [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5975.3s)]
*  for some change. I don't know what the ultimate kind of strategic endpoint is meant to be here, [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5981.860000000001s)]
*  but clearly there's something I think Chimak might have a good read on this and seems to make a lot [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5986.58s)]
*  of sense. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5992.82s)]
*  Well, we have a military base there and we also protect it and we occupy it already, [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5993.46s)]
*  which is interesting. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5998.18s)]
*  Yeah, we somewhat abandoned all that in Greenland, but there is a lot of that infrastructure still [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6001.14s)]
*  sitting around here. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6004.74s)]
*  Can I ask you guys a question? I listened to Lex Friedman's interview, totally off topic, but [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6005.22s)]
*  I listened to Lex Friedman's interview with Graham Hancock. You guys ever heard of this guy? [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6010.66s)]
*  Yes. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6014.9s)]
*  Have you read any of his stuff or watched any of the shows? [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6015.14s)]
*  No, I have not. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6018.18s)]
*  No. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6019.38s)]
*  Okay, so he's got this belief that there was this ancient civilization on Earth, not sci-fi, [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6019.62s)]
*  futuristic, but an advanced human civilization and that's where the Great Pyramid of Giza was. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6027.700000000001s)]
*  There was a smaller pyramid that was built there and a lot of these other kind of historical [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6032.820000000001s)]
*  places were built and then they were built on top of later, but that a lot of these advanced [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6038.58s)]
*  civilization was wiped out during the last Ice Age. There was a very rapid kind of freezing event [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6044.42s)]
*  that happened over a period of about 1200 years and that's when this great kind of Ice Age era [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6052.26s)]
*  civilization was wiped out. But what I didn't realize, and so I went down this really crazy [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6056.74s)]
*  rabbit hole in the last week, unlike how much of planet Earth, how different planet Earth was just [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6060.9s)]
*  12,000 years ago during the Ice Age. Have you guys spent any time on this? [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6067.14s)]
*  I just went down a similar rabbit hole with the Grand Canyon. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6071.38s)]
*  First of all, how the planet Earth has changed in such a short period of time blows my mind, [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6075.7s)]
*  but the sea level was 400 feet lower than it is today, just 12,000 years ago, and there were [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6079.54s)]
*  humans on Earth at the time. And so all of this area that we look at as like Malta, the island of [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6086.900000000001s)]
*  Malta, was the southern tip of a continental stretch that went into Italy. So it was all part [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6093.9400000000005s)]
*  of one great landmass and there's all this area that was actually part of that landmass that now [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6099.86s)]
*  sits under that ocean there and there's these like ruts in the ground for moving stuff and [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6105.219999999999s)]
*  buildings and all this other crazy stuff. And we have no idea like what's actually under the ice [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6110.9s)]
*  in Greenland, what's under the ice in Antarctica. There's all these parts of Earth where humans very [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6115.7s)]
*  likely had some... This is so off topic, we could cut this from the show. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6120.5s)]
*  No, I think it's incredible. It's so crazy that there's all these parts of Earth and [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6124.179999999999s)]
*  especially in the oceans, as we start to explore, there's actually large humans, [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6129.46s)]
*  potentially advanced civilizations that lived in these areas, not like the ones flying around. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6134.42s)]
*  The Atlanta stuff, that it was actually an advanced civilization. And then humans lost a lot of this [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6138.58s)]
*  ability when this period of freezing happened over 1200 years. And then a lot of it was preserved in [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6142.82s)]
*  legends and myths that showed up in later archeology and later museums. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6149.38s)]
*  How do you explain the pyramids? [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6153.78s)]
*  I think he has a really interesting explanation. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6156.34s)]
*  Because we had Gavin explain it last time. Welcome to conspiracy quarter. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6158.5s)]
*  So somebody sent me an email. And he said what they did was they flooded the area. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6162.26s)]
*  And then they floated the rocks into place. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6167.38s)]
*  They floated the rocks up. Yes. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6169.14s)]
*  But you know what, Chamath and I were talking about this too, because when you remove all that [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6171.86s)]
*  crust, because we actually were talking, we just didn't use the guy's name. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6174.9800000000005s)]
*  It's just like Uranus. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6177.62s)]
*  When you break away all that crust, what did they find in Uranus, Friedberg? [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6178.900000000001s)]
*  Mine was better. Mine was better. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6182.34s)]
*  You got it. You landed the joke. It's great. It's great. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6186.58s)]
*  We finally got there, folks. This has been another amazing episode of the All In Podcast. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6189.38s)]
*  It's different. Yeah, I can't say anything other than, Cyan, you were great for a first time out. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6194.82s)]
*  You got to the conspiracies. You rocked it. You got to interject more because it's a vibrant panel. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6201.9400000000005s)]
*  But for a first time out, very solid debut on all in idle. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6207.06s)]
*  By the way, before you go, do you have an alternative explanation for the pyramids? [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6209.38s)]
*  Yeah, Cyan, what are UFOs? [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6212.9800000000005s)]
*  I've looked into, I mean, UFOs is the only one that I usually come back to because, [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6214.9800000000005s)]
*  you know, if you look at putting logs underneath and trying to roll them, or you look at [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6219.860000000001s)]
*  flooding an area, all of this just doesn't make a whole lot of sense. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6224.820000000001s)]
*  And then, you know, the fact that there are other civilizations that also have pyramids [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6230.34s)]
*  that are stunning and feats of engineering as well, things like Stonehenge, etc. I mean, [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6235.14s)]
*  there's just things that defy explanation. I don't know if you ever tried to make a catapult, [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6241.62s)]
*  but it's really hard. It's really hard. And so, like, we just did not have the technology, [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6245.94s)]
*  or at least we can't find any definitive way that it happened. And so I do think there is a [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6254.0199999999995s)]
*  possibility that there was a more advanced civilization here or we were visited. And I [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6260.18s)]
*  think about that a lot. I think it's mutants. I'm going with the X-Men theory. I think there were [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6265.7s)]
*  mutant human beings who had the ability with superpowers to build them. It could be that. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6269.7s)]
*  It could be. Why not? Why not? Matter and alchemy or something like that. Who knows? [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6273.54s)]
*  This is what we've come to now. We get Conspiracy Corner at the end of every program. We try to [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6278.58s)]
*  figure out unsolved mysteries. Welcome to Unsolved Mysteries. And oh, just a little [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6282.179999999999s)]
*  housekeeping here as we wrap. Our friends, our partners, dare I say, at Polymarket have done us [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6287.78s)]
*  a solid free bird. Check this out. We talked a little bit about our long debates here on the [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6294.9s)]
*  program. So Chamath, we created a market here. The magnificent seven shrinks below 30% of S&P [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=6302.339999999999s)]
