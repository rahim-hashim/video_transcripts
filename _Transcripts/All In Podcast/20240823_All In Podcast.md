# Massive jobs revision, Kamala wealth tax, polls vs prediction markets, end of race-based admissions
**All In Podcast:** [August 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E)
*  Do we have free burgers? Did he drop off for here? He's free birds back. Okay, three, two, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=0.0s)]
*  I just had to take a leak. I just, I go outside my office and then I come back. Oh, you like a [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4.8s)]
*  nature pig. You're a nature guy. Me too. I love a great nature. I have this great office at home, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=9.36s)]
*  which is like a building outside of my house. So I like to go in the garden, take a breath of fresh [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=14.0s)]
*  air and just, you know, you don't sit down to pee. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking around. You guys, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=18.56s)]
*  so many jokes. I'm not going there. That's a soy estrogen boy joke is up. No, we can cut this out, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=27.119999999999997s)]
*  but my pediatrician said H-MOP, I think it's really important to teach your boys [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  to pee sitting down. And even for you, as you get older, it's good for the prostate. And there's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=36.56s)]
*  like a materially different percentage in terms of prostate cancer rates when you pee sitting down, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=44.959999999999994s)]
*  because you expel all the pee that just kind of gets caught there. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=50.56s)]
*  What a little dribble swear to God, bro. I swear to God. Wait, wait, what about a shape? Nick, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=54.720000000000006s)]
*  you can cut all of this. No, the shape doesn't do it. This is great sitting while you're needing [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  aids and muscle relax in benefiting men with pelvic floor muscles or symptoms of an enlarged [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=65.2s)]
*  prostate sitting to enhance the stability falls and minimizes messiness, especially for [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=71.28s)]
*  sex. Whenever sex gets a new home, he puts urinals in. That's how much of a man he is. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=78.8s)]
*  How does your staff hold your body while you pee? Like do they hold you? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=87.2s)]
*  History of the world. Mel Brooks. This study is like the vasectomy truck at the DNC. I mean, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=92.0s)]
*  it's meant to emasculate men. That's the only interpretation of it. It's total nonsense. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  All right. The Labor Department has revised down the job growth numbers as a number of members of [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=108.8s)]
*  this panel predicted the BLS updated its non farm payroll stats downgrading actual job growth to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  around 30% versus what was originally reported. This means the US economy created around 818,000 [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=133.68s)]
*  fewer jobs over the 12 months leading up to March 2024. Number was originally reported as 2.9 million [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=141.84s)]
*  new jobs created and it's more like 2.1. The Labor Department updates and revises its stats frequently, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  it gives disclaimers, but this is the largest and most significant revision since 2009. After the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=154.0s)]
*  great recession. And so the biggest downgrade came in the field, not surprisingly, of professional [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=160.96s)]
*  and business services with 350,000 jobs lost over the last year. We see that in all the stats of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=168.16s)]
*  different tech companies and businesses, finance companies doing layoffs, other fields that revise [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  their numbers, leisure, hospitality, manufacturing, retail, makes sense, and a little bit in [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=182.4s)]
*  transportation. Here's a couple of charts for you before we go and get some feedback. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=187.04s)]
*  Civilian unemployment rate seasonally adjusted. As you can see, since the great financial crisis, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=191.76s)]
*  we went from 10% all the way down to well below four and that's where we sit today. USA Today chart [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=197.76s)]
*  here of gains and losses since 1980. Obviously that massive drop you see there of minus 9.3 [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=205.44s)]
*  million jobs was COVID with the big quick rebound of 7.3. So overall, the country's in great shape. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=212.24s)]
*  Sachs, your thoughts on the revision? You obviously made note of this when we went through the numbers. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=220.88s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, I predicted this would happen and I didn't know exactly how we would get the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=226.4s)]
*  correction, but now it's come out. By the way, it's not just this 818,000 jobs. If you look at [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  the last 12 months and out of all the restatements, it's been something like 1.2 million. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=240.88s)]
*  I can share the chart on that, but this is quite remarkable. About a year ago, I tweeted really [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=246.72s)]
*  fairly casually that there was a hot jobs report. This was around June of 2023 that I didn't know [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=254.48s)]
*  where they're finding all these jobs. I mean, all I see is layoffs. That was my reaction based on [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=263.6s)]
*  not just what I was seeing in tech and all of us, especially last year, we're seeing nothing but [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=268.8s)]
*  layoffs in tech. It was also feedback from real estate investors that I knew. I mean, all new [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=273.52000000000004s)]
*  real estate projects have basically stopped because the cost of borrowing was so high and there was a [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=280.16s)]
*  credit crunch. So new construction projects had stopped, refis were very hard to get. It's just [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  that everywhere I was looking in the economy and the feedback I was getting from people, things [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=290.32000000000005s)]
*  looked pretty dismal. And yet the media was continuously putting out stories about hot jobs [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=294.32s)]
*  reports. And we've been getting this now for roughly a year. And then what happens is that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=300.24s)]
*  there's a revision and the revisions have always gone in one direction. There are always a revision [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=306.32s)]
*  down. I mean, if the revisions were completely sort of neutral and arbitrary, you'd expect it [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=312.56s)]
*  to be like a coin flip. You might have 10 revisions and five would be up and five would be down, but [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=319.36s)]
*  they've all been down. So what I saw was a pattern of revisions down. And now we've seen the biggest [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=323.92s)]
*  one. So it's not altogether surprising to me. And in hindsight, when I tweeted that a year ago, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=332.0s)]
*  I got this hysterical reaction. I mean, it was one of these tweets that all of a sudden everyone's [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=339.44s)]
*  like, quote tweeting and telling me to stay in my lane. I'm a VC and I don't know the numbers. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=344.64s)]
*  And it was like I hit some sort of nerve. And, you know, whenever that happens, you're usually [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=349.6s)]
*  over the target in some way. Yeah, it's generating. It's triggering people is what you're saying. Yeah. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=355.12s)]
*  Yeah. So the question is like, why were they so triggered? And I think the reason is that on some [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=360.24s)]
*  level, people were intuiting that the numbers didn't really make sense. It didn't really match [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=364.8s)]
*  up with what we're seeing in the economy. And now a year later, we have the proof of that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=368.88s)]
*  So Chamath, let me go to you next, because you pointed out that these numbers seemed a little [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=373.20000000000005s)]
*  fugazi fugazi, but we have 162 million people record employed in the country. This number, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=378.4s)]
*  if it's 162, you take out 800 161. This is what the Fed was been trying to do to cool off inflation, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=385.67999999999995s)]
*  right? We needed to see a little bit less employment. And that's part of it. So I guess [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  the silver lining here is if we are revising these numbers down, that would give more of an indication [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  that we've slowed the economy, correct? Yeah, I mean, I think the economy is a lot slower than what [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=404.64s)]
*  people thought, which, to your point, the silver lining is that it probably now tips [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  the balance of action in September to a cut. And if it was 25 basis points, there's probably going [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=418.64s)]
*  to be a lot of folks lobbying the Fed to cut 50. And I think that they probably have enough [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=426.24s)]
*  numerical justification now to cut 50. I think the bigger problem, though, is if you don't have an [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=436.16s)]
*  accurate sense of where employment really is, and Sachs did mention this, you will also then have an [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  inaccurate sense of where GDP is. And I think the one to punch could be very problematic. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=452.64s)]
*  I think what we're learning more than anything else is we have a very sophisticated economy. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=460.24s)]
*  We have a very sophisticated capital market system. We have very sophisticated actors in those [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=464.8s)]
*  markets, all of us included, who can react to real time data and make the right decisions. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=470.32s)]
*  The problem is we have bad data. And the bad data, I think, is something that is fixable. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  But we need to make an effort to do it because it's insane that the largest and most sophisticated [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=483.44s)]
*  economy in the world is this unpredictable. And I think that's like the big question that I have, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=488.8s)]
*  which is how is it possible in 2024 that we haven't just made this a priority to fix this? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=495.36s)]
*  And with all of the systems that exist and all of the SAS tools that exist and everything that's [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=499.44s)]
*  used to hire and fire and pay people, we don't have an accurate sense of this number. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=504.56s)]
*  And it could easily, Chema. That's a real head scratcher to me. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=509.44s)]
*  This could easily be crowdsourced or we could pull data from a lot of different places. Obviously, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=513.76s)]
*  they pull some data from employment roles. But I remember you had a startup, I can't remember the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=518.08s)]
*  name of it, but you had crowdsourced people were going around and taking pictures of the price of [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=522.56s)]
*  tomatoes in different places and then putting it into a database and organizing, I think, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=528.24s)]
*  funds and other folks. Yeah. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=533.36s)]
*  Yeah. So what that company did was it was an agent that you would download on your phone and [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=534.8000000000001s)]
*  we would task you to go and collect certain kinds of information. And yeah, there was some [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=539.12s)]
*  socioeconomic data that was collected. A lot of it now is with three letter agencies and the like. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=544.0s)]
*  So without getting into details, that company is doing quite well, but it's just moved in a [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=551.9200000000001s)]
*  different direction. If you just created some kind of like a DARPA challenge, like equivalent to this, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=556.08s)]
*  give it to Stripe, give it to Gusto, give it to a handful of these smart companies to give a [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=562.4s)]
*  guesstimate and see who accurately predicts this number over the course of a year or two. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=569.36s)]
*  That's more reliable and frankly, more useful to the market than what the BLS is doing. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=575.4399999999999s)]
*  My first job out of college, by the way, was not in tech, but it was in finance. I was a derivatives [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=580.24s)]
*  trader. And what was so incredible is I remember sitting at my desk in front of my terminal on the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=585.6s)]
*  trading floor when non-farm payrolls would hit and people would just go crazy. There would just [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=591.04s)]
*  be literally tens or hundreds of billions of dollars that would start flying back and forth [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=596.8s)]
*  based on what that number was. And now to think about that much velocity [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=602.48s)]
*  in a totally random way, because those numbers aren't reliable, it seems just crazy. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=608.24s)]
*  Okay, Freebird, here's a chart for you to comment on. Maybe we open the aperture here. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=612.8s)]
*  Total employment and unemployment here in the United States, as you can see, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=617.36s)]
*  you know, since the 80s, population has grown and the number of people employed has continued [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=621.84s)]
*  to grow, labor participation, it kind of peaked in the 90s in the Clinton era, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=627.6800000000001s)]
*  and it's come down a bit since then. But overall, what do you think of the health of the economy [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=631.92s)]
*  and employment? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=638.48s)]
*  I mean, I think the Fed target is 4%, which is kind of where we're at. I think we're at 4.2 or [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=640.8000000000001s)]
*  4.3 now. And so the Fed tries to balance inflation, unemployment and rates. That's kind of the three [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=646.16s)]
*  things that they're looking at. So they make adjustments to rates. Obviously, if you take rates [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=654.3199999999999s)]
*  too low, too fast, you have an increase in inflation. So their target and inflation is 2%. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=663.28s)]
*  Their target and unemployment is 4%. So if you take rates too high, you can certainly reduce [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=667.76s)]
*  inflation, but then the economy can contract or slow down and job cuts start to come through. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=672.56s)]
*  So now, with inflation kind of supposedly approaching 2% and unemployment over 4%, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=679.6s)]
*  the market, if you look at the trading markets, they are now estimating a 100% chance of a [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=688.16s)]
*  3.25% rate cut by the end of 2024 and a 70% chance of a one-point rate cut by the end of 2024. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=695.6800000000001s)]
*  So the question is, are they going to do 3.25% cuts by the end of the year, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=706.96s)]
*  or are they going to do a 50 basis point cut and then a 25 or a 50 and a 50? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=711.0400000000001s)]
*  The next couple of weeks will determine which direction. And then obviously, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=715.76s)]
*  Chairman Powell has his big speech happening on Friday. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=719.76s)]
*  Friedberg, what does the betting market say specifically for September? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=723.6800000000001s)]
*  50 or 75% chance of a quarter point cut, 20% chance of a 50 basis point cut, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=729.2s)]
*  and then 6% chance of no cut, which is kind of strange because the trading markets, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=737.6800000000001s)]
*  this is obviously a prediction market, but the trading markets are showing effectively [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=743.6800000000001s)]
*  a 100% chance of a three-quarter point cut by the end of 2024. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=747.28s)]
*  And, Sax, here's the dramatic Fed. We always talked about them kind of getting on this a [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=752.48s)]
*  little bit late, but you can see here, man, what a ramp up in 2022 where we were basically at a [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=758.48s)]
*  quarter point and they just added a quarter point and 50 BIPs all the way up to 5.33. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=766.48s)]
*  Where we've been flat, inflation, obviously, we have the two-handle now. So now we start the [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=772.0s)]
*  process of going down. And I think people generally believe 25 BIPs at a time will be [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=776.64s)]
*  their pattern coming down. You think that seems wise? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=783.12s)]
*  Well, I think the Fed isn't sure that inflation is a solved problem. I mean, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=786.16s)]
*  I think that Powell is a little bit reticent to start the rate cutting cycle because he doesn't [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=789.1999999999999s)]
*  know for sure if inflation could tick back up. This first cut is, in a way, the most important [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=793.76s)]
*  one because it signals a regime change that we're beginning the rate cut cycle. And what he doesn't [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=799.1999999999999s)]
*  want to do is cut any amount and then be proven wrong and we get a bad inflation report. And then [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=805.04s)]
*  all of a sudden he has to raise it again. So he doesn't want to be caught in that position. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=810.56s)]
*  But I do think that the economy is obviously showing significant weakness. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=814.88s)]
*  Inflation is not completely solved, but it's down to 2.9 percent, at least it has a two-handle on [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=819.36s)]
*  it now. And so, yeah, I think the market is pricing in these rate cuts for a reason. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=823.8399999999999s)]
*  So either mission accomplished or we'll see if we have a soft landing, hard landing, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=830.0s)]
*  or something in between. Most people feel like it's going to be soft with a little bit of bumps. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=834.96s)]
*  It seems to me. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=839.44s)]
*  I mean, now that we know that the jobs picture was inflated by 1.2 million jobs over the last, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=841.68s)]
*  call it roughly a year or 14 months, I think we know that this is not like a perfectly soft landing. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=847.84s)]
*  I think that the economy is a little bit shaky and is being propped up by massive amounts of [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=854.32s)]
*  government spending like we talked about on a previous episode. We're running unsustainably [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=860.96s)]
*  high levels of deficit and debt. We're running what? $2 trillion a year deficits right now. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=865.2800000000001s)]
*  And what are we getting for that? We're not getting a super robust economy. We're getting [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=870.48s)]
*  an economy that's narrowly staying out of recession. So it's a little bit of a scary [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=873.9200000000001s)]
*  picture, I think that the economy is so shaky and we're spending so much money to prop it up. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=880.08s)]
*  We'll just have to see what happens. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=886.32s)]
*  Yeah. And it doesn't seem like either of the incoming administrations really cares about [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=887.76s)]
*  spending. It seems like we're going to be in still big money spending mode, independent of who wins. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=893.84s)]
*  We'll see how long that can last as a country. And then we talked a little bit about the Supreme [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=899.52s)]
*  Court decision last year around affirmative action. And [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=906.4799999999999s)]
*  it turns out now MIT has released their data. It's getting a lot of buzz online. Here's a chart. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=913.52s)]
*  Basically what you can take from this chart, and this is people self-identifying at MIT, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=919.36s)]
*  and the buzz is that Asian Americans have gone from 41% to 47%. And those gains came [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=924.3199999999999s)]
*  on a percentage basis from a decline in the number of Black and Latino students coming in. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=933.04s)]
*  Here's the chart, as you can see. So people are wondering about, I guess, the fairness of this. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=941.04s)]
*  And I guess you could have either one or two positions, Chamath. Asian students were being [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=949.28s)]
*  penalized for a long time. Or now, I guess you could believe that Latin and Black students are [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=954.8000000000001s)]
*  being impacted negatively about this. So I'm not sure what your take is, but it's obviously moving [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=961.12s)]
*  to more of a meritocracy according to the people at MIT. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=965.68s)]
*  It's not even clear how they were making decisions before nor now. But I tweeted about this yesterday. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=970.16s)]
*  I think the thing that matters more than anything else is to make sure that the people that they are [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=979.68s)]
*  letting in are in love and obsessed with the things that MIT is supposed to be great at. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=987.12s)]
*  So if you are a great creative thinker, designer, architect, you should be at RISD. I'm just [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=994.5600000000001s)]
*  giving an example. If you are a great musician, you should be at Juilliard. You should not be [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1003.28s)]
*  going to MIT because you think it's a checkmark. You should be going there because you think that [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1010.4s)]
*  there are professors in organic chemistry, in physics, in these disciplines that are really [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1015.04s)]
*  important who are experts in their fields that you can learn from and become an expert yourself. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1022.64s)]
*  And I think the problem with all of this other stuff is once you make it a credential, there are [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1028.8799999999999s)]
*  some folks that are only going to MIT because they could get in and because it's a great [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1033.84s)]
*  credential in their minds. And they shouldn't go there either. So I think the thing is you have to [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1040.8s)]
*  get back to what matters, which is there are all of these industries that have not progressed that [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1047.28s)]
*  much. And in order for those industries to advance, you need really talented young people who can [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1052.96s)]
*  learn and apprentice and then take over. And I think MIT is one of these rare places that focuses [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1058.32s)]
*  on this part of the physical world that hasn't had as much progress. And so I just want to make sure [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1064.0s)]
*  that the people that go there actually want to be there for that reason. Gender, race, all that other [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1072.9599999999998s)]
*  stuff shouldn't matter. And that is what the Supreme Court decision did. You cannot take race [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1077.52s)]
*  into account. Harvard had some weird thing, Friedberg, where personality was one of the vectors. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1084.56s)]
*  And sorry, Harvard, I would say that no offense to everybody at Harvard, but like, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1092.4s)]
*  Harvard is more of a pure credential. Like MIT, I buy more that you go there for certain kinds [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1096.32s)]
*  of specializations. Caltech, you go there for certain specializations. If you're really into [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1101.36s)]
*  wine, you go to UC Davis. My point is these schools exist for reasons other than just as a [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1106.72s)]
*  collector coin that you put in your pocket. I'm not sure Harvard is really known for anything [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1113.52s)]
*  other than for being quote unquote elite. But even that's questionable now. But in the technical areas, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1119.36s)]
*  I really do think that MIT was an important place where people would go to train. And I just want [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1128.4799999999998s)]
*  to make sure whoever they're letting in actually cares about the thing they're studying. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1133.6s)]
*  Friedberg, what's your take on this? Moving back to a meritocracy and a colorblind application process, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1136.6399999999999s)]
*  not being able to use race in admissions? I don't think that someone's genetics should determine [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1144.0s)]
*  whether or not they go to a school. And I think that their socioeconomic background, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1157.36s)]
*  experience set, values, successes, failures are the things that they could have affected or that [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1165.2s)]
*  I think probably better define whether we want to take a moral stance on giving other people [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1175.44s)]
*  opportunity. So I think that that's a kind of good and reasonable place for us to end up. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1181.04s)]
*  Sax, any thoughts for you from you on this? Well, I mean, I support the idea of colorblind [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1187.52s)]
*  meritocracy. I mean, I agree with Trimoth and Friedberg that the traits that you're born with [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1192.72s)]
*  are not skills or qualifications. They're just the accents to your birth. And what we should [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1198.48s)]
*  be trying to create is a society where those things don't matter and everyone has the same [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1203.68s)]
*  ability and opportunities for advancement based on how hard they work and their skills and [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1209.68s)]
*  this concept of merit. And I think that's when court decision gets us closer to that. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1215.52s)]
*  Remember that the reason why that Supreme Court decision happened or what the plaintiffs were [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1220.56s)]
*  arguing is that the previous regime on college campuses was unfairly discriminating against [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1225.4399999999998s)]
*  Asian Americans. Because whenever you try to engineer the classes to a certain proportion [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1231.12s)]
*  of the population, somebody has to win and somebody has to lose. And the students who [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1237.36s)]
*  are losing were Asian Americans. And in many cases, these Asian Americans were [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1241.6s)]
*  first generation immigrants or they were coming from disadvantaged backgrounds. And yet their [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1248.88s)]
*  population was engineered to a smaller number than merit would otherwise suggest. And now you're [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1253.68s)]
*  seeing it in this new class at MIT, the percentage of Asian Americans has increased somewhat. So I [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1258.5600000000002s)]
*  think it's good. I mean, we're reducing a form of discrimination. That discrimination may have [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1266.16s)]
*  originally started for good reasons to try and create a remedy against a different kind of [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1272.3999999999999s)]
*  historical discrimination. Nonetheless, it discriminated against talented Asian students. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1278.8799999999999s)]
*  And I think now that that's been fixed. What do you guys think about [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1284.24s)]
*  creating a leg up for people that came from a disadvantaged socioeconomic background? So put [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1289.76s)]
*  race aside. But an individual that grew up in a difficult circumstance, that didn't have the [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1298.16s)]
*  privilege of going to a good school or having a good education, worked hard, tried, but didn't [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1305.3600000000001s)]
*  end up with the best test scores or didn't end up with the best GPA because of the conditions they [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1310.96s)]
*  were born into. Do you think it's appropriate to give those individuals a leg up in the application [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1315.52s)]
*  process, putting race aside, but just call it socioeconomic disadvantages? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1320.48s)]
*  To some degree, I do. I mean, look, if you have a student who gets a 1450 on the SAT, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1325.6000000000001s)]
*  but they've got tutors and classes and they're growing up in an environment. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1332.0800000000002s)]
*  They went to school in Atherton. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1336.16s)]
*  Right. They're getting the best teachers, the best schools, the best environment. And then you take [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1337.68s)]
*  a kid who grew up in, I don't know, like a dangerous part of the inner city where their [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1340.64s)]
*  shooting is happening. Or a rural district with no education. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1345.5200000000002s)]
*  Appalachia. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1348.16s)]
*  Appalachia. Both are kind of equivalently disadvantaged or differently, but both [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1348.96s)]
*  disadvantaged. Yep. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1352.72s)]
*  Right. They don't have access to the best schools, best or best funded schools, best teachers. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1353.6000000000001s)]
*  And let's say that person gets a 1400 on their SAT, which one is better? I mean, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1359.76s)]
*  certainly if they got a 1450 and you're comparing two equal scores, it's really clear that the [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1364.32s)]
*  disadvantaged student probably has more raw talent. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1368.8s)]
*  Totally. I 100% agree. And I feel like we've used race as a heuristic for that conditional [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1373.76s)]
*  background. And that's what makes it hard because race is not necessarily, it's certainly, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1380.48s)]
*  there's a correlation, but it's not necessarily indicative of the socioeconomic disadvantage [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1385.84s)]
*  that someone may have faced and had to overcome in order to perform and succeed at the level that [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1391.92s)]
*  they could have given their conditions. And so I certainly think that the incorporation of one's [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1396.48s)]
*  socioeconomic background should be a critical part of the application process. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1403.68s)]
*  And certainly in the same in the job setting, ultimately, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1408.08s)]
*  I think what would be much more valuable than all of this is for companies to hire from a whole [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1411.6s)]
*  bunch of different schools than they do today. And to break the back of this elitist culture we have [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1418.24s)]
*  around certain schools. All of the things that you guys are talking about to me sound kind of [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1426.48s)]
*  crazy. And the reason is because you could go to Iowa State, or you could go to Harvard, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1433.6000000000001s)]
*  and you could make a claim and I would buy it that in some random social science, maybe there's an [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1442.96s)]
*  advantage in the people that you meet. But there's not necessarily an advantage for studying physics [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1449.44s)]
*  at any of these two schools. It's not like one's teaching you that gravity goes up and the other [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1454.96s)]
*  teaches you that gravity goes down. So I think the bigger problem is that we don't value enough [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1458.72s)]
*  these fundamentally important skills that we need for humanity to evolve. And then number two, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1468.16s)]
*  we have fallen into this trap of saying that these schools, these highly credentialed schools that [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1473.6000000000001s)]
*  cost 60 and 70 and $80,000 a year, graduate the best kids. And I don't think that that's true. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1478.64s)]
*  I've so the thing that we could all do because we're all hirers, we hire 1000s of people, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1485.52s)]
*  is we should be going to all kinds of different schools. Today, I just gave an offer to a guy that [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1492.48s)]
*  went to Virginia Tech. And this kid seems awesome. kick ass. And when we put out job postings for [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1496.56s)]
*  8090, we veer towards these schools that are like hardcore technical places, where none of all of [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1505.6s)]
*  this random credential nonsense gets in the way. And so they're hungrier. As a result, they're more [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1514.1599999999999s)]
*  earnest, and you can cut through the BS. The other thing I would say is that it's even more capable [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1519.36s)]
*  now of getting through the filter of these credentials and knowing the quality of a person. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1526.08s)]
*  You can look at GitHub repos. If you're a developer, you can look at all of these things [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1530.56s)]
*  that allow you to understand. So I don't know, I disagree with your guys's thing of like, let's go [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1534.24s)]
*  figure out all these other things. How about we stop hiring and valuing, I think, randomly [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1539.28s)]
*  non specific degrees, just because they come from a good school. Well, I think that would be true. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1545.36s)]
*  Because we do still have a college application process, Jamal. So there are still going to be [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1550.8s)]
*  a set of criteria used to determine whether or not our kids end up getting into a specific school. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1555.52s)]
*  If we and they all kind of say, Hey, it makes sense. If your son or daughter were to go and [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1560.96s)]
*  study computer science at North Carolina State, the biggest thing that that you could do is be [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1566.56s)]
*  okay with it. Another example of a school that does a great job of recruiting from non traditional [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1571.6s)]
*  places, I would not be okay with it. No, no, this is my point. I think it's a decision. I'm saying [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1576.96s)]
*  that I'm not saying that you are, but I'm saying that if you make it a big deal that North Carolina [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1582.08s)]
*  State is somehow worse than some other credentialed school, because our social cohort says that those [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1587.44s)]
*  other schools are better. We're part of the problem. Well, in my work cohort, North Carolina [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1593.68s)]
*  State's a great school. We hire a ton of people from there. So that's a great school, actually. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1597.68s)]
*  To be honest, I think schools like that are better. I mean, I think probably Virginia Tech [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1602.72s)]
*  is better than Harvard. And the reason is because they're less infected with the whole woke DEI [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1606.72s)]
*  ideology that now pervades these like top schools. So the students are more likely to learn something. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1612.64s)]
*  Well, you should stop saying top. They're not top schools. They're not top schools anymore. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1618.0800000000002s)]
*  They're not the smartest kids. They're not the hardest working kids. So we should stop saying [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1622.88s)]
*  top schools. These Ivy League schools are not the top schools. I agree with that. Yeah, there might [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1626.4s)]
*  be the most notable schools historically, but they're not necessarily the ones that are. They're [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1630.5600000000002s)]
*  the biggest brands and they're not new brands. They're old brands. And we've seen that these [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1635.28s)]
*  old brands depreciate over time and people read way too much into them. I think the structural [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1640.24s)]
*  monopoly is that they then get and have the most capital, which they can then use to build [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1649.28s)]
*  facilities and support staff that can come and do core research. And so you then get all these [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1656.56s)]
*  research staff, particularly in technical fields, in science and medical fields and so on, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1661.4399999999998s)]
*  that want to come and be on campus. And that then creates the network effect of [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1667.6799999999998s)]
*  undergrads getting a better education because they're getting exposed to the best talent [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1671.6799999999998s)]
*  in the kind of research field. I don't necessarily think that benefits the undergrads. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1676.64s)]
*  I mean, first of all, these campuses... Well, tell us about your experience at Stanford. I [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1680.3200000000002s)]
*  think you're the only Ivy Leagueer here. Wait, Berkeley's Ivy League? You went to [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1684.4s)]
*  Berkeley. That's not Ivy League. Stanford technically is not in the Ivy League. The [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1688.24s)]
*  Ivy League is like an East Coast club, whereas Stanford was kind of the West Coast disruptor. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1691.44s)]
*  But did you get exposed to it? I mean, I know when I went to Berkeley, I worked at Lawrence [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1696.0s)]
*  Berkeley Labs. I got to be exposed to Nobel Laureates. It was actually [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1699.6000000000001s)]
*  like, I think particularly in my field, I majored in astrophysics and physics. That was [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1703.36s)]
*  a great school to get exposure and you actually had that opportunity. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1710.32s)]
*  I think that's part of the challenge. Schools with really great graduate programs and research [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1714.0s)]
*  that goes on on campus actually can give a better educational experience to the undergrads. It's [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1718.56s)]
*  almost like you're getting these internships and these fellowships and these TAs and professors. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1724.24s)]
*  Well, that's a different thing. I actually think what America needs is what I benefited from at [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1732.0s)]
*  the University of Waterloo, which is an active and vibrant co-op program. I really disagree with you. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1737.36s)]
*  I don't think that there is an incredibly better way to teach thermodynamics. I think that's a bit [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1744.24s)]
*  of a joke. I think that that's a lie we tell ourselves. I'm talking about applied work, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1749.84s)]
*  Tomas. I'm talking about you go up to Lawrence Berkeley Lab and you work in an actual lab [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1755.2s)]
*  that does really interesting research. Okay, so my point is if we both agree that these [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1759.04s)]
*  fundamental sciences- Definitely. Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm pointing out. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1762.48s)]
*  Then the universities in America that have these co-op programs I think are incredible institutions. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1766.0s)]
*  Again, they're not the typical ones. There are places like Drexel and other places, but now you [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1770.8s)]
*  allow these kids to be in the trenches with people building things. I just think that that's an [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1776.08s)]
*  incredible gift for them, but it's also an incredible opportunity for these organizations [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1781.6s)]
*  to understand the quality of the person beyond some- [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1787.68s)]
*  Credential. Well, I do think in a digital era, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1790.0800000000002s)]
*  core education has commoditized. I think most people can get most of the way there without [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1792.72s)]
*  necessarily paying $60,000 to $80,000 a year and then being partnered in some way with that on-the-ground [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1798.48s)]
*  internship or integrated program where you get actual hands-on experience. I don't know. The [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1805.1200000000001s)]
*  university model maybe does not make sense for most fields. J. Cal, what do you think? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1810.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's very interesting. The co-op- Where did you go to school, Jack? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1816.08s)]
*  I went to Fordham University at night. I got in three weeks before- [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1818.72s)]
*  Did you get an undergrad degree from Fordham? Yeah, Fordham. I was going to either- I had [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1824.32s)]
*  taken the New York- What was your degree in? What did you go to? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1829.52s)]
*  Psychology. I was going to go into the NYPD. I was about to get accepted at 18 years old, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1832.48s)]
*  17 years old, 18 years old. And then I decided the last minute to go to Fordham at night. I had to [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1840.72s)]
*  work in order to pay for it. So it took me four and a half years, but I did almost a full credit [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1845.12s)]
*  load at night. And then I was going to go into John Jay for criminal justice and get my forensic [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1849.84s)]
*  degree and then join the FBI. So I was in the process of applying to the FBI and then the [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1857.4399999999998s)]
*  internet happened. And I started a magazine about the internet and it went in a totally different [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1861.84s)]
*  direction. But the co-op stuff, I remember when we went to Waterloo, we did a speaking gig there [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1865.04s)]
*  years ago, Chamath. And I was very taken with the students there and like their like drive. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1870.72s)]
*  And so I think that's the key piece. And what I did in venture capital, because I needed to have [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1877.92s)]
*  a team of about eight people screening all the companies we get and the applications. So I just [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1883.28s)]
*  made my own training program and I hire a lot of people in Canada to do it. And basically they do [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1888.56s)]
*  five meetings a day. They write up coverage. I made an entire framework and I'm doing professional [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1895.2s)]
*  development because I found a lot of the top people from these brand name schools were entitled. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1899.76s)]
*  They didn't want to do 25, 35 meetings a week with founders. And I just found these other students [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1906.16s)]
*  from Waterloo and other colleges like that. And I've trained them in my framework for these are the [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1912.08s)]
*  13 qualities we look for in investing in a startup. And these are the 25 red flags. And I've now got [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1917.92s)]
*  seven people we did 110 120 meetings one week recently. And so it's just much better to train [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1923.84s)]
*  them ourselves and make your own training program, I believe. And so it's even like Malcolm, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1930.24s)]
*  didn't Malcolm Gladwell write something which is roughly the equivalent of like, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1935.36s)]
*  you're better off getting the top 10 student at a non IV versus like the 50th student at an IV or [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1939.6799999999998s)]
*  something. I don't know, there was like something like maybe maybe it was like a chapter. And what [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1947.28s)]
*  was his reason because of motivation? Yeah, it's like these kids are excellent. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1951.68s)]
*  When they're when they're achieving and they're excelling in things that are [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1957.2s)]
*  not subjective. He want to go get those kids. Yeah, you know, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1962.64s)]
*  they've performed. Yeah, I mean, I think one of the one of the problems with the whole DEI [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1966.72s)]
*  policy, whether you want to do it based on race or socioeconomics or whatever it is that you're [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1973.3600000000001s)]
*  doing is it keeps happening at every layer of the stack. And at some point, you just need to say, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1978.88s)]
*  Look, we've made up for whatever came before. And now it just has to be about that person's [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1984.88s)]
*  performance. We need to stop putting our thumb in the scale and just hire the best person. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1990.0s)]
*  My view is you could probably do that after undergrad, like there's no need to keep [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1994.0800000000002s)]
*  artificially adjusting the weights of how you hire people after undergrad. But yet you have [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=1998.72s)]
*  all these like programs that keep trying to make the decision based on something other than merit. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2006.08s)]
*  And I think that that's the part that needs to stop. I mean, we have Coleman Hughes on and, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2012.1599999999999s)]
*  you know, I think he had a very good perspective on it, which is like maybe starting with earlier [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2016.48s)]
*  education is where you could probably solve some of these problems a little bit more effectively. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2021.1999999999998s)]
*  I will say, I feel like my experience in the workplace is that one's college or university [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2025.1999999999998s)]
*  is completely decoupled from one's performance or ability to succeed in the workplace in an [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2032.08s)]
*  meritocratic workplace. And when I say meritocratic, I mean, excluding nepotistic workplace settings [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2037.1999999999998s)]
*  and excluding demographically biased workplaces. And if you exclude those two, it honestly does [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2043.4399999999998s)]
*  not matter what school someone went to. They could be brilliant, they could be hardworking, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2049.52s)]
*  they could be passionate, they could be a leader, the school doesn't matter. And in fact, perhaps [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2053.36s)]
*  the corollary is true, which is the people that went to the schools that determine success [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2058.72s)]
*  generally have a very hard time succeeding in the workplace, because anytime they face failure, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2063.2s)]
*  it is a challenging circumstance for them that they are unable to overcome. And that's particularly [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2068.3999999999996s)]
*  true in entrepreneurship. That's been my experience. Perhaps in the broader workplace setting, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2073.2s)]
*  they could work well, where they're told all the time, if you do this, then you get that, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2077.2799999999997s)]
*  they do this, they get that, they feel good, they succeed in that model. But in the real world, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2081.4399999999996s)]
*  that's not the model. And I think that that's a really important fact that's colored my point [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2086.0s)]
*  of view on how the higher education system actually does perform with respect to improving the [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2091.84s)]
*  quality of our workforce in the US. Separate that, I will say that in technical fields, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2096.72s)]
*  the research environment on certain college campuses can be incredibly, to Chamoff's point, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2101.6s)]
*  opportunistic for getting exposure to hands-on work that you might not otherwise get in technical [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2108.56s)]
*  field. So a lot of this comes down to motivation. You know, at a certain point, a person has to be [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2114.56s)]
*  motivated to put in a lot of hours and become excellent at whatever their chosen profession is. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2119.44s)]
*  I think I talked about it previously, when we started talking about macroeconomics here, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2125.2s)]
*  I took a macroeconomics course at MIT on their website, or on YouTube, rather, right, there's [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2128.4s)]
*  incredible that this stuff is all out there. And anybody can take any of these courses for free. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2134.0s)]
*  That's what I mean by like the basic, the base education has been commoditized. You know, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2138.0s)]
*  it's the hands-on experience that one gets that makes a huge difference. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2142.48s)]
*  MIT 1401 principles in microeconomics, supply and demand. I mean, it was like incredible. And, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2145.68s)]
*  you know, this is stuff I just didn't ever get exposed to. And I was able to do it for free. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2152.4s)]
*  I listened to the course actually twice, and I took notes on it. I really got a lot out of it. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2156.4s)]
*  All right, listen, more stuff on the docket. Anybody else have final thoughts here? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2161.28s)]
*  Before we go into the election stuff and taxes. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2165.68s)]
*  Let's all commit to hiring as many people as possible from non-traditional schools. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2168.8s)]
*  Absolutely. I mean, that's what I do already. I mean, it's it's working. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2172.88s)]
*  All right, decision 2024. Get ready for a bit of chaos here, folks. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2176.32s)]
*  The DNC is underway as we tape. We tape on Thursdays, as you know, I think Kamala [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2182.4s)]
*  will give her accepted speech tonight. DNC pulled out all of their all stars, Michelle Obama, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2188.2400000000002s)]
*  Barack, Hillary, Bill Clinton, Oprah and Tim Walsh spoke last night. Most people felt he [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2194.24s)]
*  had a pretty strong showing. Our guy, Nate Silver, friend of the pod has the election as essentially [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2200.4799999999996s)]
*  neck and neck. We're in coin toss territory here. I think it's going to be come down to the debates. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2208.72s)]
*  I'm interested here. My besties think here is the Silver Bulletin, his new publication. He's not at [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2214.24s)]
*  538 anymore. Just Kamala at 47, Trump at almost 45. And this all will come down to the swing states, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2220.16s)]
*  I think, as we all know, he's got a really great interactive chart over there. He's got Harris with [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2229.04s)]
*  clear leads in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and Virginia. I think those are about 68 [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2234.56s)]
*  electoral college votes. Trump with clear leads in Georgia and Florida. My Lord, Florida is 29 or 30 [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2240.3199999999997s)]
*  electoral college votes. That's a lot. The toss up states Nevada with the tipping and no tax there, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2246.16s)]
*  but that's only six. North Carolina has been flip flopping back and forth from Harris to Trump. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2254.08s)]
*  Those two are worth 24. So we swung from many paths to victory, basically a certain victory for Trump [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2261.8399999999997s)]
*  with versus Biden to now a toss up. This is an interesting chart here, Sax, I want to get your [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2268.3199999999997s)]
*  take on which is the polling averages. I think you said last week or the week before that we [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2275.44s)]
*  would see the Harris bump reverse. And that's exactly what's happened. The month over month [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2280.32s)]
*  change is dramatic, as you see in this table. But the week over week change. So in the month change, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2285.12s)]
*  you have Democrats running the table in all the swing states. Then you look at the weekly change, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2292.32s)]
*  the opposite in the last week, the Republicans have not caught up, but made significant gains [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2297.68s)]
*  all between a half a percentage point and a point with the exception of North Carolina, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2304.32s)]
*  which as I stated earlier is a toss up. Your thoughts on the election right now, Sax, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2309.1200000000003s)]
*  before we get into the issues just on the numbers here. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2316.6400000000003s)]
*  Sax Well, the election is going to be on the [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2319.1200000000003s)]
*  nail biter and it's going to really come down to a few thousand votes or a few tens of thousands [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2322.2400000000002s)]
*  of votes in swing states. I think we've known that now for a while, I would say since Biden [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2327.04s)]
*  abdicated and they did the hot swap. I think the most interesting poll numbers over the past week [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2333.04s)]
*  is if you look at polymarket that it has swung back to Trump being in the lead over the past [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2340.64s)]
*  week as opposed to Harris last week, I think Harris was favored to win by quite a bit. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2346.56s)]
*  And you have to ask the question, well, how does this happen during her own Democratic convention, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2351.92s)]
*  which is supposed to be nothing but a four day infomercial for the Democrat candidate. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2357.04s)]
*  Yes, it's a coronation. So she should be getting nothing but a bump and instead it seems to be [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2361.7599999999998s)]
*  the opposite. And I think the reason is, is because the more substance her campaign puts out, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2367.6s)]
*  the more policies it reveals the worse she does. First, they had her give that economic speech last [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2373.8399999999997s)]
*  Friday on price gouging and price controls. And we spent a lot of time last week talking about [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2381.52s)]
*  why price controls would be a disastrous economic policy. Subsequent to that, there were stories [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2388.08s)]
*  that came out about her campaign supporting these huge tax hikes that were in the original Biden [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2394.24s)]
*  Harris budget, including a 25% unrealized gains tax, which we can talk more about. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2401.04s)]
*  Just to boil it down, I think the more the public learns, the more we learn about what she would do [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2407.2799999999997s)]
*  as president, the worse she does. And they've now got to run out the clock for another, I don't know [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2413.04s)]
*  what 70, 80 days in terms of running a campaign that's substance free, that's just completely on [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2418.48s)]
*  vibes. That's about joy without answering any questions, without doing any press interviews. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2424.08s)]
*  And I think we predicted some time ago that that just was not going to be sustainable, that at some [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2429.6s)]
*  point, they're gonna have to tell us what they think. And as they do that, the more they do that, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2433.44s)]
*  I think the more her polls will correct. What do you think, Tomok, you trust these [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2438.08s)]
*  betting markets? Because there's so much at stake at this election, right? I mean, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2442.48s)]
*  people are pouring money into both campaigns. It's really contentious. People see it as [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2446.08s)]
*  existential on both sides. And then you have, you know, these prediction markets that, you know, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2452.0s)]
*  have low tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars being bet. Could these not be, you know, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2457.52s)]
*  influenced you trust them? Because we are seeing this is the first time these prediction markets [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2465.6s)]
*  have become a major discussion point, because they're businesses, obviously. But people are [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2471.52s)]
*  really getting into them. And I wonder if they could be manipulated? Or if you think you trust [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2477.36s)]
*  them? I guess is the way I'm asking you because we've had this discussion a bit offline. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2483.68s)]
*  I mean, I think these are really good businesses, but they are some combination of [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2488.88s)]
*  entertainment and gambling. I don't think that these things are as useful [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2495.04s)]
*  directional indicators as they are just really interesting businesses that allow people to bet [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2499.6s)]
*  and wager on all kinds of random things. So I would not look to these sites for that necessarily. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2505.6s)]
*  Okay. I think that people like Nate Silver do a pretty reasonable job. In his specific case, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2513.92s)]
*  I think he does a very good job of threading together and doing this meta analysis of polls. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2520.56s)]
*  But I think we've learned that the that this polling is pretty brittle and not super reliable. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2527.2799999999997s)]
*  So the the betting markets are exactly that they're just like, it's like sports betting, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2533.2s)]
*  but just wasn't a betting market. We talked about this two weeks ago. Shapiro was like 80% [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2538.16s)]
*  or something. So yeah, it's fairly obvious. Freeburg that maybe these betting markets are [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2542.16s)]
*  a little bit entertainment, but maybe directionally corrected because they also did start to predict [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2548.08s)]
*  the hot swap, you know, so what do you think freeburg about these betting markets? Well, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2551.44s)]
*  I think you and we keep everyone keeps trying to reduce this down to some deterministic binary [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2555.2s)]
*  system, which is like it works or it doesn't. And the truth is, that the conditions of the world are [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2560.08s)]
*  changing all the time. The news is changing all the time, people are taking action all the time, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2565.68s)]
*  there's a shift in current events all the time. As a result, the forecast is changing all the time. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2571.6s)]
*  And so what a betting market or a poll does is provide a probabilistic forecast of the future. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2578.88s)]
*  There is a probability of something happening. It is not trying to say I as a poll, or I as a market [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2588.0s)]
*  am right 100% of the time, or not. It is saying here's the estimated distribution of outcomes in [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2594.56s)]
*  the future. So there is a 20% chance or an 80% chance of Shapiro, 20% chance of him not being [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2601.28s)]
*  the case. Turns out that that 20% is where Harris ended up going based on some meeting she had in [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2607.6s)]
*  some room with some group of people that we aren't privy to, and that the market in that case was not [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2614.24s)]
*  privy to. What Nate Silver does, and I think people need to understand this a little bit. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2618.88s)]
*  When you gather polling data, that poll has some predictive power based on how the pollsters [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2625.04s)]
*  conduct their poll, who they call, how they screen candidates for the poll, etc, etc. So [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2631.7599999999998s)]
*  different polling companies, it turns out, are better or worse at making that directional [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2637.44s)]
*  probability bet than others. And what Nate's models do is they account for the historical [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2642.96s)]
*  performance of different pollsters and weight them differently to create a basically a multipoll [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2649.92s)]
*  prediction. And so that's what his system is set up to do. And remember, he similarly doesn't give [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2656.4s)]
*  you one outcome. He gives you a distribution of outcomes. I think his simulation model has [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2662.08s)]
*  probably 1000 or 10,000 simulations that come out of it. And those simulations, he says, look, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2667.04s)]
*  there's a 29% chance of this happening 70%. He's not trying to say here's what's going to happen. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2672.4s)]
*  He's trying to give everyone a point of view on the distribution of things happening in the future, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2676.72s)]
*  just like weather forecasting is not perfectly predictable. It's very predictable for tomorrow, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2680.88s)]
*  it's less predictable for three days from now. And it's very unpredictable 12 days from now. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2685.6s)]
*  And that's how these polls also work out. And that's also how these massive mega models [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2689.84s)]
*  of polls and it's also how prediction markets work. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2694.0s)]
*  And freeburg, people have a lot of emotion in these models when it comes to politics. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2696.0s)]
*  Whereas if you were looking at gambling, or the odds of winning a poker hand, we all would be like, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2701.28s)]
*  Oh, you have a 30% chance of winning, or a 10% or an 8% you're gonna hit two outers. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2706.4s)]
*  There's emotions both way, J Cal. So basically, when I read those polls, or I read the summary [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2710.96s)]
*  of the polls, I have a bias based on my interest in the outcome that says that thing is BS, that [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2716.96s)]
*  thing is right. Oh, look at this. And everyone points to this stuff for confirmation bias of [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2723.28s)]
*  their opinion. Yeah. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2727.44s)]
*  And to denounce the other side. And so it all gets caught up as kind of a media angle when [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2728.7200000000003s)]
*  people use polling data. And also fundamentally, when people kind of get involved in polls and [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2733.76s)]
*  create polls, there's also the risk of bias. And part of what Nate Silver and others try and do [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2740.2400000000002s)]
*  is figure out does that bias come out in the polling performance historically? And that's [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2745.1200000000003s)]
*  how they kind of wait, whether or not this poll is going to be a better or worse indicator than [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2750.4s)]
*  other polls of the distribution of things that might happen in the future. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2754.56s)]
*  And Zach, if people were to lose, you know, a poker hand, that they, you know, were 60% to win, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2757.44s)]
*  or two thirds to win, you know, they would be like, Okay, that makes sense. When Hillary Clinton [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2764.48s)]
*  lost to Trump the first time people lost their minds. And he was pretty clear, right? He was, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2770.32s)]
*  I think, 65 35. And people are like, Wait, you said it's 65%. Yeah. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2774.96s)]
*  Your thoughts on just the accuracy of polls generally, and then what you heard here in terms [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2780.4s)]
*  of the betting markets, how do you look at these two things that are taking up a lot of space right [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2784.1600000000003s)]
*  now? Well, I would consider prediction markets to be an additional tool that we should consider [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2789.84s)]
*  side by side with polls. And they both have their pluses and minuses. The advantage of polls is [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2795.52s)]
*  that you're actually talking to real people as opposed to betters. However, they're very [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2802.4s)]
*  dependent on sampling and getting the sampling correct. I mean, most of these polls talk to [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2808.32s)]
*  maybe 1000 respondents. These are people who are willing to pick up the phone from a unknown number. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2814.2400000000002s)]
*  That right there is probably a huge source of bias because I don't do that. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2818.96s)]
*  And then based on that sample, they're going to predict how millions and millions of people [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2822.8s)]
*  are going to vote. Well, everything depends on the composition of that sample, which 1000 voters do [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2826.4s)]
*  you talk to? Do you weight them based on likelihood of voting or demographic characteristics, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2832.2400000000002s)]
*  and so on? So the polls can be notoriously inaccurate. We've seen that many times. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2837.6s)]
*  And that's why there's a margin of error. Sometimes the margin of error is even wrong. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2843.52s)]
*  So in any event, it's a tool, but it's a tool that almost by definition is going to be wrong [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2848.72s)]
*  because of sampling problems. You look at prediction markets, and it's a totally different [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2853.36s)]
*  type of voting mechanism where betters are willing to put their money where their mouth is. And [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2857.8399999999997s)]
*  they've got real skin in the game, and they're able to make a prediction based on their willingness [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2863.12s)]
*  to lose money. Now, there can be problems with that, too. Number one, the betting market can [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2868.7999999999997s)]
*  be very thin. Sometimes there's just not a lot of money that's trading hands. So I think with a lot [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2872.56s)]
*  of those VP picks, you can move the VP market by putting just a very small amount of money because [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2877.12s)]
*  the market wasn't very liquid. So you have to kind of look at how deep and liquid the [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2882.56s)]
*  prediction market is. And then I'd say, second, the issue with prediction markets is they, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2886.48s)]
*  and this could be an advantage, is they move a lot based on small things because people are [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2891.68s)]
*  just constantly updating their forecast. I would argue that maybe that's an advantage, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2897.3599999999997s)]
*  is that you could see the trend more easily in a prediction market. So for example- [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2902.0s)]
*  Yeah, I have some numbers here, too, if you want to hear them. $653 million in political bets are [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2909.04s)]
*  currently being placed across the top 10 betting markets and all of the markets on polymarket, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2914.56s)]
*  which includes things outside of politics, are 320 million. So they are the big fish in this, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2919.68s)]
*  I think. They're the leader, but it's still a very thin amount of money to your point, sex. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2925.52s)]
*  Yeah, I would mostly use the betting markets as a measure of how sentiment is shifting. So for [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2930.56s)]
*  example, on election night, the betting market is going to convert to 100% in favor of one [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2937.52s)]
*  candidate or another, whereas the actual votes are not going to convert to 100%. You could have [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2943.68s)]
*  an election in say, Pennsylvania, where one candidate gets 50.1% of the vote, the other [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2949.68s)]
*  candidate gets 49.9%. The betting market is going to converge to 100-0% because it's predicting who's [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2954.72s)]
*  going to win. It's a binary yes or no as opposed to where the actual vote tolls come out. The polling [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2960.48s)]
*  is trying to approximate where the vote tolls are going to come out with a huge margin of error. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2967.04s)]
*  So the polls are never going to give you as pristine, decisive an answer as the prediction [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2971.68s)]
*  markets, but the prediction markets can also be wrong as we've seen. They're only as good as the [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2977.76s)]
*  people making the bets. Chamath, where do you put the third category here, which would be the odds [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2982.48s)]
*  makers in Vegas? Because they're looking at everything. What do you think about the odds [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2987.6000000000004s)]
*  makers in Vegas? Would you give them any credence? I don't even know why any of this matters. Why are [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2991.28s)]
*  we talking about this? Well, I mean, because people are looking at the tea leaves. There are [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=2996.96s)]
*  reasons it matters. These markets do have an impact on the voting public because [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3001.5200000000004s)]
*  the media covers them. Donors cover them. Voter turnout is impacted by the polls. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3008.2400000000002s)]
*  And then there's these various psychological phenomenon like the underdog impacts or [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3013.6800000000003s)]
*  bandwagon. So you could have, if people perceive at one point Trump is the underdog, maybe more [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3023.28s)]
*  people turn out and then people who, if Trump was winning versus Biden so much, they might become [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3029.6000000000004s)]
*  complacent and you get some sort of surprise there. So they do have actual impact on the voting [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3035.76s)]
*  public. I suspect though that a lot of that is really at the edges. I read an article recently [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3040.1600000000003s)]
*  that just talked about the enormity of the investment that both the Democrats and the [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3048.8s)]
*  Republicans are making to get to these critical areas in these five critical states. And if you [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3053.0400000000004s)]
*  live in one of these zip codes that really matter, I think that there is just no room for anything but [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3060.4s)]
*  what each side is saying. I don't think you're looking at a betting market or a poll or any [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3068.56s)]
*  of this stuff. And I think the reason why these places have become so critical is that they are [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3074.64s)]
*  very balanced. They are people that have a good way of making sense of the world and they change [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3080.48s)]
*  their minds a lot, right? Otherwise, they're people that underwrite and re-underwrite their [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3088.56s)]
*  decisions. And to me, that's actually a really wonderful thing to know that there are these, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3094.64s)]
*  call it million people in these zip codes in five states that are actually quite thoughtful. And [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3100.56s)]
*  I'm actually okay that in the end, that those folks will decide. I would be much more worried [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3107.52s)]
*  if it was hyperpartisan and set up in a way where none of these lies, whoever tells them, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3112.48s)]
*  are uncovered. The way that it's set up today, all of the crazy ideas get run to the ground, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3120.32s)]
*  all of the lies get uncovered. And I think that that's a really healthy place and I think it's [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3128.64s)]
*  a much better place. So I'm generally like, really glad that things look like, quote unquote, a [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3135.28s)]
*  question mark, because I think it creates much more pressure for the candidates to be precise. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3141.44s)]
*  And I think that that's very important. So I'd love to talk about some of these crazy policy [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3147.68s)]
*  things as well. Yeah, we're going to talk about that. Sax, I wanted to get your take on this. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3151.52s)]
*  Trump's VP pick, JD Vance, is now the least popular VP pick in modern history. People said the same [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3155.28s)]
*  thing also about walls, that that was a terrible pick. Here's your chart on JD and here's the [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3160.96s)]
*  historical chart. John Edwards, man, I remember him. He was plus two in net rating, Tim Walz plus [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3166.88s)]
*  five, Mike Pence plus five, Kamala when she was VP plus three, but JD Vance is absolutely, he's below [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3173.36s)]
*  Sarah Palin, which I guess takes effort. What's your take on the VP picks and the impact they're [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3181.2000000000003s)]
*  having here? Because it's a major topic of discussion. I think what history shows the VP [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3186.96s)]
*  pick doesn't matter that much. People vote for what's happening at the top of the ticket. And [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3192.2400000000002s)]
*  I would argue the reason why JD has the polling he does is because there's a couple of reasons. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3196.4s)]
*  Number one is just media bias. And there was an interesting report showing that the media's [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3201.52s)]
*  coverage of the Harris campaign was 84% positive, whereas the coverage of the Trump campaign was 89% [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3206.56s)]
*  negative. That actually seems to understate the bias that I see out there. But look, this is the [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3211.6800000000003s)]
*  number one reason why JD has a negative rating is because the media is defining him. I'd say, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3215.28s)]
*  furthermore, JD is out there talking about ideas, and I give him credit for that. But because he is [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3220.0s)]
*  an idea man, and he's also a writer, and he's said interesting things in the past, and also sometimes [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3227.68s)]
*  occasionally a sarcastic thing or two in the past, the media has been able to take those things out [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3233.6s)]
*  of context and harp on them relentlessly. On the other hand, you take someone like Tim Walz, and [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3237.92s)]
*  he's out there, he's not really talking about ideas. I mean, every time he goes up there and [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3245.2s)]
*  speaks, it's like a pep talk. I mean, if I wanted to hire a guy to give the halftime speech to my [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3248.72s)]
*  team, he'd be the guy. If I wanted him out there puffing up a team talking about how we got to all [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3255.2799999999997s)]
*  give 110%, he's the guy for that. But he's not really talking about ideas. He's not going on [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3260.9599999999996s)]
*  the Sunday shows. You look at JD, I mean, I've watched a couple of his campaign stops. I mean, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3266.16s)]
*  the guy is really sharp. And when he goes on the Sunday show, they are pitching nothing but [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3271.12s)]
*  fastballs at him, and he's hitting it out of the park every time. And Harris and Waltz are just not [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3276.8s)]
*  doing that. They're not even appearing on those shows. I don't think they could survive 20 minutes [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3283.1200000000003s)]
*  of harsh questioning the way that the media pitches at JD every time he goes on a campaign stop and [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3288.0s)]
*  takes questions or he goes on a Sunday show. I love the JD pick, you know, venture capitalist [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3294.5600000000004s)]
*  business guy, well written, well spoken. You're picking up on something that I think is really [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3299.6800000000003s)]
*  important that I think has been under reported. It really is a tale of two different tickets. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3304.48s)]
*  The Republican ticket, whether you like them or not, are very financially astute actors. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3311.44s)]
*  And if you look at the Democratic ticket, they are under invested to not invested at all in anything [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3320.72s)]
*  that would normally resemble the United States economy. And I find that a very odd distinction, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3328.16s)]
*  meaning the way that I would think people would want to see their candidates is folks who have [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3336.3999999999996s)]
*  a very sophisticated understanding of the parts that they're going to govern. And in this case, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3344.64s)]
*  if you're going to sit atop the economy, one would hope that you're invested in the economy [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3350.7999999999997s)]
*  in some way so that you know how it works. And it's a little surprising to me that nobody's [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3354.4s)]
*  really questions how under invested the Democratic ticket is. And it's almost as if the Republican [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3358.88s)]
*  ticket for their financial sophistication is looked down upon to unpack what you're saying here. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3365.76s)]
*  There was a report. Tim Walz has no financial holdings. He has no stocks, no bonds, no mutual [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3371.76s)]
*  funds, no real estate, nothing, no cryptocurrency. This is what you're referring to. Yeah, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3378.64s)]
*  Yachema. Yeah, the level of like literally owning nothing. And I guess free bird to your I'll let [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3383.2s)]
*  you take it from there. So I think it's actually a step a little bit deeper than that. Kamala Harris [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3389.6s)]
*  and Tim Walz have only ever worked for government. Trump and Vance have worked in private industry. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3399.2s)]
*  It's not just their perspective being colored by the lack of participation in the private economy, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3410.32s)]
*  but the lack of employment in the private economy. They've never worked for a private business. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3417.76s)]
*  They've never been employees of a private business. They've never built a private business. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3423.44s)]
*  I'm not trying to be disparaging, but I do think I'm just trying to underline the point here, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3427.28s)]
*  Chamath, which is the voters choice is do you want candidates that are not typically government [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3431.6800000000003s)]
*  operatives? Or do you want candidates that have spent their whole career as government operatives? [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3438.56s)]
*  And that is effectively what the voters are going to be voting for. And they're going to make a [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3443.7599999999998s)]
*  decision. They may want to have someone that's going to lead the biggest government in history [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3447.2799999999997s)]
*  because they've spent their whole careers in government. Or they're going to say, you know [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3452.4s)]
*  what, the biggest government in history needs to be significantly altered. And we want to bring [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3455.7599999999998s)]
*  someone in from the outside that's worked in private industry. And that is the voters choice. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3459.84s)]
*  That's one way to view the voters choice here. That's an interesting framing. And another framing [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3463.92s)]
*  might be free bird. I love that. Hey, it's an interesting framing. Here's another framing. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3467.92s)]
*  I don't, you're a young person. I can't own a home. They're too expensive. I don't have any equity. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3473.36s)]
*  I'm getting ground down. I own a, I owe a bunch of student loans. Tim walls feels more like the [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3480.16s)]
*  experience I'm having as a millennial where I can't afford a home where I don't have equity, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3486.56s)]
*  where I'm constantly trying to pay off my bills. And the finance, what we'll say is like, Hey, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3491.76s)]
*  this guy's not very financially astute. He doesn't even own his own home. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3496.72s)]
*  He's never, it's because he's never, maybe it's because he's never had a private sector job. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3499.4399999999996s)]
*  Well, he's been a teacher, right? So maybe people say, you know what I feel, I identify more with [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3506.0s)]
*  Tim walls. And I think that's actually what might be happening here. Public school teacher, right? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3510.72s)]
*  Yeah. But I, yeah, right. Which is a noble thing to be. And I think there's probably a large [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3514.3999999999996s)]
*  percentage of the country who feels like they're not part of the equity economy. They don't own a [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3519.3599999999997s)]
*  home. They don't own equities and they have been shut out from this. And all these rich people like [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3524.88s)]
*  Trump and JD Vans and venture capitalists are running the table on them. And I think that might [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3530.08s)]
*  be why we're seeing, even if the four of us disagree with it, we might be seeing someone like [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3535.12s)]
*  Tim walls actually, it might be a feature to their, to their, and, and I think that there's [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3540.32s)]
*  a perception of experience in government that is deemed to make a government [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3546.32s)]
*  leader more appropriately suited to be a government leader. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3553.28s)]
*  A career politician. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3555.92s)]
*  Yeah. Well, not even a politician, just career experience. So they're being employed by [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3557.52s)]
*  or working within the government, within a government, local state or federal. And [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3563.0400000000004s)]
*  remember, Kabul has started her career at the DA's office in Alameda County before moving over to [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3566.88s)]
*  San Francisco DA's office. And then she was DA of San Francisco and then attorney general and [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3571.52s)]
*  so on and so forth. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3576.96s)]
*  Sax, what do you think of this framing? You have two candidates who are career civil servants who [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3577.92s)]
*  have dedicated their life to that, but who in one case has doesn't own his home, doesn't own any [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3583.36s)]
*  equities. In the other case, Kamala does have a bunch of equity and some private wealth versus [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3588.56s)]
*  the capitalists. It looks like this actually is an interesting framing, socialism versus capitalism. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3594.16s)]
*  What's your thought on that frame? [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3598.96s)]
*  Well, I think just because someone has served in government doesn't mean that they truly even [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3600.2400000000002s)]
*  understand what the problems are or that they're even the master of government. I mean, you saw [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3604.8s)]
*  this over the past week. We talked about the 818,000 jobs that didn't exist. They asked Gina [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3608.88s)]
*  Raimondo, the secretary of commerce about this, and she just said that's a Trump lie. And they [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3614.4s)]
*  said, no, actually, it's the Bureau of Labor Statistics report that like is under US secretary [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3618.0800000000004s)]
*  of commerce. She said, I'm not familiar with that. So you have people running the government who [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3623.6000000000004s)]
*  don't even know what their own departments are doing. Now, I think it's just a function of the [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3627.52s)]
*  fact that government is so big and out of control that no one even understands what it does. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3631.36s)]
*  I think it's more important to have someone who at least has some experience in the private sector [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3635.52s)]
*  who truly understands how jobs are created, how wealth is created, what causes inflation. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3640.32s)]
*  We've talked about this before. What causes inflation is the printing of too much money. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3646.4s)]
*  It's government spending too much. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3650.48s)]
*  Yeah, shocking. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3652.4s)]
*  It is not corporate greed because corporate greed is a constant. It's not price gouging. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3654.08s)]
*  How the free market incentivizes the creation of improved productivity, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3658.7999999999997s)]
*  which over time translates into improved prosperity for the society within which [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3664.24s)]
*  that is taking place. That is so critical. And we saw that happen even in China in the last 30 years [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3670.16s)]
*  when the government allowed entrepreneurship to flourish in certain parts of the country. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3676.56s)]
*  As a result, there were significant productivity gains and they brought a billion people out of [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3681.36s)]
*  poverty. They created a middle class. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3685.92s)]
*  They created a middle class. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3688.32s)]
*  Never had a middle class. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3689.52s)]
*  I think it's important to not color this as because you worked in government, you can't [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3690.7200000000003s)]
*  be invested or you can't own a home or you can't actually have built a nest egg, right? Because [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3695.92s)]
*  that's also not true. There's some extreme examples of people who've been essentially, [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3700.1600000000003s)]
*  yeah, career civil servants essentially, and have built multi-hundred million dollar portfolios. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3705.6800000000003s)]
*  Clintons. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3710.0s)]
*  We can question specifically in the case of all house representatives whether they're getting [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3711.36s)]
*  access to a kind of information that other people don't get access to. But taking that off the table, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3717.44s)]
*  I think that there are people in all kinds of jobs who are able to save and invest and then [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3723.28s)]
*  acquire things that they believe will give them security for themselves and their children in the [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3732.8s)]
*  future. And I don't think that it is because of a kind of job that you do. I think it's a kind of [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3736.8s)]
*  mindset that you have. And I think it's very important to make sure that whoever we pick, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3742.72s)]
*  we understand the mindset. I really believe that there are a couple of things that are really [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3750.64s)]
*  critical to thinking about the future and wanting to make the future better. I think one obvious one [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3757.8399999999997s)]
*  is when you have kids. When you have kids, you're making sacrifices every day. You're forgoing [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3764.08s)]
*  things today because whether it's saving for college, saving for school, saving for a class, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3769.44s)]
*  saving for a sports thing that you want your kids to go to, music, whatever it is, you're always [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3774.08s)]
*  finding ways of thinking about what is better in the future for that other person, not me. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3779.12s)]
*  And the second is I think being an investor actually makes you care about the future in a [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3786.08s)]
*  really productive way because you're forgoing often cases when we all invest. We're forgoing short [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3792.56s)]
*  term gains on the hope that we can help shape a much longer term outcome in the future that makes [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3799.04s)]
*  all of that worthwhile. And so I like it when I can see people that have those things at play [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3805.52s)]
*  and that they even in whatever small way they can are manifesting that. And I always have a question [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3812.72s)]
*  mark like how is it possible that at no point you have tried to be invested in your own and [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3819.36s)]
*  your children's future that way? It's just a question mark for me. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3825.36s)]
*  Yeah, 58% of Americans own equities and that includes like retirement accounts. So it's not [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3828.7200000000003s)]
*  like they're actively day trading. And so that does actually Sachs paint an interesting picture [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3833.76s)]
*  where maybe the Democratic Party now, which they've referred to themselves Bernie and Elizabeth Warren [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3840.1600000000003s)]
*  as a socialist, as socialist Democrats. Maybe this is like part of their feature is to appeal to that [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3844.6400000000003s)]
*  large swath of people who don't own their homes, who don't have kids. And to Jay G's point about [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3850.4s)]
*  cat ladies and to who don't own homes, don't have kids and don't have equities. What are your [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3857.04s)]
*  thoughts on that Sachs? Is that maybe how these parties are starting to shape up in the modern [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3862.56s)]
*  era? Yeah, actually, I think that's right. I mean, I think that Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3867.6800000000003s)]
*  are now the thought leaders and really the beating heart of the Democrat Party. I think what's [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3873.28s)]
*  happened is the Republican Party has moved to right wing populism and the Democrats in response [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3877.44s)]
*  to that have concluded that they need to basically move to left wing populism in order to compete [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3882.2400000000002s)]
*  with that. So both parties are becoming fairly populist. Now, what is what does left wing [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3887.68s)]
*  populism mean? It basically means soak the rich, right? It's a strong element of class warfare to [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3893.36s)]
*  it. We're going to make the rich pay for everything and the rich are the problem. It's this fundamental [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3898.4s)]
*  and fairness to the economy that's causing all these problems. And I think you've heard that over [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3902.88s)]
*  and over again at the DNC. I mean, just the clips that I've seen, this has been a recurring theme [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3907.52s)]
*  is the hatred towards billionaires and rich people. And tax the rich is a recurring theme. And that's [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3912.7200000000003s)]
*  actually a great jump off point here because the big news in our circles this week on social media [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3919.6s)]
*  was and some of the group chats is that Harris has reportedly backed some of Biden's really out [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3925.84s)]
*  there tax plans, which include a proposed 25% wealth tax on people with over a hundred million [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3933.04s)]
*  dollars in assets. Important to note that this would be very hard to pass because getting these [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3939.44s)]
*  tax increases, you'd have to get through Congress, et cetera. But let's just talk about what the [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3944.1600000000003s)]
*  proposal is because it's out there. In Biden's 2025 tax plan, which the campaign has said to [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3948.08s)]
*  semi for, which is a niche publication, like a newsletter company that and I'll just give the [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3954.88s)]
*  quote in a little notice portion of its Friday analysis of Harris's new economic plans, the [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3961.44s)]
*  committee for a responsible federal budget wrote that her campaign said it endorsed the suite of [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3966.56s)]
*  revenue options included in President Joe's recent budget. And that's the FRB report said, [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3972.88s)]
*  quote, the campaign has communicated to us that vice president Harris continues to support all [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3979.28s)]
*  of the revenue raising provisions in the president's 2025 budget. So there is continuity [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3984.8s)]
*  confirmed between Harris and Biden's plans. I'll just explain as simply as I can what this [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3990.7200000000003s)]
*  extreme plan says, and then I'll get to. Your take on it. Biden's proposed 2025 tax plan includes [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=3998.4s)]
*  the following 25% unrealized cap gain tax on those with over 100 million assets, 28% corporate tax [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4004.8s)]
*  rate. Right now it's 21. Trump had proposed a 15% rate and quadrupling the stock buyback tax to 4%. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4012.0s)]
*  That's when a company buys their own shares as opposed to putting it to work in the market. The [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4019.2s)]
*  stock buyback tax was created as Biden's inflation reduction act of 2022. It's just 1% if you want to [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4024.72s)]
*  buy back your shares like Apple and some other companies do. But let's unpack the 25% unrealized [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4030.4s)]
*  cap gains because that seems to be the most, let's say, I don't want to say triggering, but the one [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4036.32s)]
*  that's triggered the most number of people. There's 5,000 people who fit into that category. What do [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4043.76s)]
*  you think, Chamath, of this proposal? Fair, unfair, crazy, social, anti-American? [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4048.32s)]
*  It's less about fair or unfair, but I think that we are in the part of the cycle where enough people [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4056.0800000000004s)]
*  don't feel the positive aspects of capitalism that they want to push back against it. I just put a [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4064.72s)]
*  little image in here, Nick, if you want to just throw it up in the chat. But when you look from 1913 [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4071.04s)]
*  on to today, the reality is we've had many different forms of political philosophy that have [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4078.64s)]
*  governed the country. And what you can see is that tax rates have varied wildly at the federal level. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4085.2s)]
*  And I think it's because that at certain times, there was the political will to go to extremes. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4092.7999999999997s)]
*  And this may be a moment where we are going to explore the extremes that we had in the 40s and [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4102.48s)]
*  the 50s. And I think the reality is that if that does happen, you're going to see people behave in [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4110.639999999999s)]
*  ways that weren't possible in the 40s and 50s. In the 40s and 50s, everybody was more geopolitically [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4117.84s)]
*  constrained. I don't think that that's the case anymore. And the way that people start companies, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4123.4400000000005s)]
*  where they start companies, the flexibility of citizenships have changed really dramatically. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4128.24s)]
*  So if it's the will of the people that they want to explore these mechanisms, I think other people [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4134.56s)]
*  will react in kind and the die will be cast. So I don't have much of an opinion. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4140.24s)]
*  You're referring to removing your I think you're implying people might be able to move [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4147.04s)]
*  to other places and create companies there. Is that what I'm reading? [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4152.16s)]
*  Let's put it this way. We have a small microcosm of this going on within the 50 states, which is, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4155.6s)]
*  if you said California was the United States, and Texas and Florida were, [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4161.6s)]
*  I'll make up two different countries, Malta and Dubai. Well, what happens when [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4168.96s)]
*  taxation goes beyond the pale? And what happens when budget deficits and spending go beyond the [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4175.36s)]
*  pale? And when the government plays too large of a hand in the economy, people leave with their [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4181.599999999999s)]
*  feet, companies leave. So we don't need to guess what's going to happen. Because if it can happen [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4187.36s)]
*  between California and Texas, it probably stands to reason it can happen between the United States [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4193.12s)]
*  and the UAE as an example. Yeah. You already have a bunch of hedge fund [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4198.96s)]
*  matters moving over there, right? I have people are starting to buy apartments. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4204.88s)]
*  There's golden visas in some great countries. Portugal has a golden visa. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4210.88s)]
*  The UAE has a golden visa. Italy has a golden visa. The UK had this great program, [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4215.2s)]
*  what was called non-DOMs for a long time. So the point is that all of these took advantage of [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4221.68s)]
*  countries that went to extremes, and they lost citizens as a result. And I suspect that if what [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4229.36s)]
*  the US voting population wants to do is explore that extreme, these policies will get enacted, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4236.32s)]
*  and then people will act in kind. The only thing that I would just, again, reinforce is, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4242.96s)]
*  unlike when taxes went to 90% in the 40s and 50s, people are much, much more mobile than they were [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4247.679999999999s)]
*  then. And that was during World War II and the post-war era. Freberg, your thoughts on this [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4254.32s)]
*  proposal specifically, which impacts a very small number of people, although maybe a high percentage [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4259.5199999999995s)]
*  here. Yeah. So just to give a little more detail to it, J. Cal, please. And you can actually see it, [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4264.88s)]
*  I think, Nick, if you want to pull up the page 8283 in the document. So the wealth tax is 25% [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4270.16s)]
*  of your unrealized capital gains if your net worth is above 100 million. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4278.799999999999s)]
*  And the first time this happens, you can split up the payments over nine years. You have nine years [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4283.2s)]
*  to kind of pay down the assets or sell the assets or borrow the money you need to make those tax [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4287.44s)]
*  payments. After that, you can actually make those payments over five years. Those payments are [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4292.4s)]
*  ultimately treated as pre-payments on taxes that what we do when you realize the capital gains. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4297.36s)]
*  Every year, you have to report to the IRS, separated by asset class, the cost basis and [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4302.639999999999s)]
*  the estimated value of every asset you have. You then have to determine your tax that you owe [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4308.16s)]
*  because of the difference from last year. You start out with tradable assets of stocks. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4313.599999999999s)]
*  Those are just valued at the end of your illiquid assets like private companies or real estate. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4318.32s)]
*  You don't have to get a valuation. If there is a financing event or some other sort of [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4325.76s)]
*  major revaluation, you have to use that value. And if there isn't, the number goes up every year [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4330.16s)]
*  by some nominal rate that will be set by the treasury. So the treasury is basically going to [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4336.64s)]
*  tell you what they think the value of your company has gone up on an annual basis. And that's the [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4340.72s)]
*  determination of valuation. You can file an appeal. So for all the entrepreneurs and startup people [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4346.64s)]
*  listening, there's a process that they're proposing that is basically the government saying, [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4351.280000000001s)]
*  if you didn't get a new financing round done, the price goes up. And if you disagree with the price [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4355.92s)]
*  going up, you go back and you appeal it. Let's pause there for a second, Freberg, [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4360.4800000000005s)]
*  because this is super important, I think, to the audience here. Somebody has a startup company, [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4364.32s)]
*  it becomes worth $10 billion. It has 100 million in revenue. It's doing well. It's losing money. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4368.96s)]
*  For our nine valuation comes in founder owns 25% co-founders on 25% each. They own two or three [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4374.48s)]
*  billion dollars in stock. Now you've got an illiquid founder who owns $3 billion in stock. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4380.719999999999s)]
*  Companies not going public. There's no secondary market. What would happen to that founder? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4387.36s)]
*  So they've addressed this and that's the final provision. And what they said [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4392.160000000001s)]
*  is that if a taxpayer is treated as what they're calling illiquid, meaning that their tradable [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4396.72s)]
*  assets, the stocks that they own or the cash that they have is less than 20% of their total wealth, [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4403.68s)]
*  then they may elect to include only the unrealized gain in their tradable assets [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4412.4800000000005s)]
*  to determine their tax liability. However, if you do this, you will actually have a deferral [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4418.64s)]
*  charge, which means you'll ultimately pay a higher tax on the capital gains on your illiquid asset [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4424.160000000001s)]
*  when you do have a realized capital gain on it. So they're trying to cover the fact that people [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4429.200000000001s)]
*  might have all their assets tied up in real estate or all their assets tied up in private company [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4433.92s)]
*  stock. And again, I feel like we're kind of shouting into an abyss here because this is [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4438.320000000001s)]
*  only going to affect such a small number of people, but they've really tried to write this in a way [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4442.4800000000005s)]
*  that ultimately covers the kind of pushback that you're highlighting. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4447.28s)]
*  I'll say one other piece of pushback that's been received and tested in the Supreme Court. A lot [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4450.4s)]
*  of people have said that the 16th Amendment prohibits this taxation. A ruling from the [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4455.92s)]
*  Supreme Court was published June of this year. And in that particular case, there was a repatriation [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4463.28s)]
*  tax for folks that left the country. It's the Moore versus United States tax case. And when [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4470.5599999999995s)]
*  people left the country, the government under the Tax and Jobs Act, which was passed under the Trump [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4476.64s)]
*  administration, the government had a right to go after people's assets and tax them on their [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4481.6s)]
*  unrealized gains, even after they give up their US citizenry. This was challenged to the Supreme [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4485.68s)]
*  Court. And there was a number of amicus briefs filed on this case that said the government does [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4490.56s)]
*  not have the authority and Congress doesn't have the authority to actually tax on unrealized capital [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4495.4400000000005s)]
*  gains. And at the end of the day, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. And they did not [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4501.04s)]
*  overturn on the position that the government actually did not overstep their authority to be [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4506.08s)]
*  able to tax unrealized capital gains. So there is some Supreme Court case precedents here that [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4511.84s)]
*  indicates that this will not get thrown out on an unconstitutional ground basis. So there is a lot [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4517.04s)]
*  of conversation that this might actually become a real case. I'll pause there. And I actually have [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4522.08s)]
*  a theory I want to talk about in a minute, but it's a little bit of an extension from this point. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4526.4s)]
*  Is this a seizure of assets in your mind? Is it constitutional in your mind? Two questions there. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4531.6s)]
*  It's certainly a confiscation. I mean, basically, this this tax is directed at [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4540.4800000000005s)]
*  centimillionaires and billionaires to basically take 25% of what they have. I mean, that's basically [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4545.200000000001s)]
*  what this is about. There's a good reason why realization is one of the core concepts of our [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4549.84s)]
*  tax code. What realization gives you two really important things. Number one, you have a sale [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4556.32s)]
*  price, right? Your realization means that you sell the asset. So we know exactly how much you made. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4561.5199999999995s)]
*  Number two, you have the liquidity to pay the tax bill because you've just sold the asset. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4567.12s)]
*  The problem with an unrealized gains tax is both those issues. Number one, [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4572.08s)]
*  we don't know what the asset's really worth. You know, it's easier to put a value on a publicly [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4576.639999999999s)]
*  traded asset, but a private asset, it's very hard to know exactly how much it's worth. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4582.08s)]
*  Evaluation's bouncing around all the time. What this bill would do is create, I guess, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4586.88s)]
*  a whole new process and bureaucracy to try and put a value on that. But it's going to be really [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4590.64s)]
*  complicated to comply with. All of us are going to need to hire a whole new legion of lawyers and [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4595.84s)]
*  accountants. So I mean, you're talking about a whole new essentially tax bureaucracy that's [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4601.28s)]
*  going to spring up around this concept. On the liquidity part, you're being taxed a huge amount [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4606.8s)]
*  without having the cash to pay the tax bill. And yes, they've tried to mitigate that by creating [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4613.68s)]
*  this installment plan, but you're still going to need to go out and sell large chunks of your [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4619.28s)]
*  company every time you get an up round in order to pay the tax bill. And that means that you're [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4623.76s)]
*  losing ownership of your company. All these assets are going to be dumped on the market. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4628.88s)]
*  And you're basically starving the market of capital, actually, right? Because all these [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4634.0s)]
*  people who are owners of their company are going to have to go out and sell a big chunk of them. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4638.4s)]
*  This is going to put so much cold water on the entrepreneurial market. It's going to make people [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4643.28s)]
*  just have less liquidity to invest in things. I think this is going to be disastrous. It's [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4648.08s)]
*  caused a lot of people to retire early because they just don't want to deal with all this. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4652.96s)]
*  Well, Freeberg, what's your theory? Okay, I've got a theory. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4656.88s)]
*  Oh, theory. Here we go. Good. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4659.76s)]
*  I was trying to figure out why we seem to be embracing socialist principles, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4661.04s)]
*  like why I keep seeing more of this stuff become mainstream and almost become normalized. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4668.16s)]
*  And I was looking at the total GDP of the United States is $25 trillion. The federal budget for [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4674.32s)]
*  next year is proposed to be $7.2 trillion. And state and local budgets combined is about $4 trillion. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4683.2s)]
*  So if you look at government spending, it's about half of GDP now, state, local and federal, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4690.24s)]
*  which roughly equates to about half of people in the United States are employed directly by [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4696.16s)]
*  government or indirectly because the government is the primary revenue source of their business. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4702.4800000000005s)]
*  And I think that that's why this set of policies, and I'm not talking about the tax on the cent of [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4709.360000000001s)]
*  millionaires as much as a simple disregard for the fact that the United States over time, [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4715.36s)]
*  the prosperity that we've realized has been driven by a free market economy, [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4724.0s)]
*  by enterprising individuals going out and saying there are people that are asking for things. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4728.4s)]
*  I'm going to figure out a way to build those things and make it for them and sell it to them. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4733.12s)]
*  People will pay for it. They will work hard to do it. And the incentive structure in a free market [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4736.719999999999s)]
*  has enabled productivity improvements and enabled ultimately prosperity. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4741.84s)]
*  But we've reached a tipping point. And the tipping point is when half or more of the population [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4745.76s)]
*  begins to be employed by the government, at which point that concept is lost because now it is the [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4750.96s)]
*  government that is the employer, not one's own individual liberties and ability to go out and be [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4756.96s)]
*  enterprising. And so I think that the budget of government tipping to 50% of GDP is the reason [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4761.4400000000005s)]
*  why these policies become mainstream. That's my theory. And so it's a relationship of [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4768.4s)]
*  government spending as a percent of total GDP, which translates into employment. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4773.36s)]
*  Very reasonable. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4777.839999999999s)]
*  Scary, but reasonable. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4779.679999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, who says something similar back when Mitt Romney ran for president, [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4781.2s)]
*  he was caught on tape saying something to the effect that 47% of Americans were [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4785.28s)]
*  net government recipients. And if that number ever got to 51%, then basically the free market [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4792.72s)]
*  system would be finished because it'd be more takers than makers. And he was forced to apologize [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4799.6s)]
*  for that. But there is a fundamental logic to it. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4806.320000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't use the term taker, Sax, because there are hardworking people that work for the government. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4809.04s)]
*  And so it's not necessarily about just taking a free check or there's certainly an aspect of that [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4815.2s)]
*  to some degree, but it is about the government becoming the primary supporter of individuals in [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4820.4s)]
*  this country through employment or through subsidies or through checks or through what have you. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4827.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's fair. I think that's totally fair. I'm not disparaging the efforts of legitimate [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4832.96s)]
*  government workers because you do need a government. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4838.799999999999s)]
*  Or private company workers that just happen to have the government as their only customer. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4841.44s)]
*  Right. But the point is that when you become a government employee, you have a vested interest [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4846.0s)]
*  in government. You should have a vested interest in the private sector as well, because that's [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4851.76s)]
*  what generates the tax revenue to fund the government. But as a practical matter, [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4854.88s)]
*  government workers vote massively in a block for the Democrat party. And in many ways, [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4859.76s)]
*  the Democrat party is the party of government workers. You look in California, for example, [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4864.64s)]
*  the various government workers unions are the most powerful players in California politics. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4869.6s)]
*  What's the political affiliation of like, has there ever been surveys done of employees at [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4874.88s)]
*  the federal level and what their political affiliations are? [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4879.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Vastly, vastly more Democrat. I mean, look, the Democrats are the party of government. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4882.64s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4887.76s)]
*  I'm surprised by that because I would think that within the ranks of the military. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4889.4400000000005s)]
*  You look at the enlisted military, there's a lot of Republicans in there, a lot of military [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4893.52s)]
*  families, especially Republican. But you look at just government workers, vastly more Democrat. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4898.56s)]
*  I think there's other things happening as well. I mean, look, American capitalism requires a robust [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4905.68s)]
*  middle class. And in many ways, I think globalization has hollowed out the middle class. There used to be [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4912.0s)]
*  a large middle class in this country of blue collar workers who worked with their hands. They [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4918.4800000000005s)]
*  were not knowledge workers. And they worked in factories and they did kind of blue collar work. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4923.52s)]
*  And they could still make a middle class living. And I think that over the last 20 to 30 years, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4928.08s)]
*  as a result of globalization, millions and millions of those jobs went away and millions [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4934.4s)]
*  of factories shut down. So the middle class of America, that's not, you know, again, that's not [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4938.72s)]
*  knowledge workers, were really pressured by basically throwing open American markets to [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4944.4s)]
*  foreign goods. Now, you could argue that that lowered prices and that created consumer surplus [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4948.88s)]
*  and the benefits of trade. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4954.5599999999995s)]
*  Do you support the Trump tariffs as a solution there, Sachs? Because those are fundamentally [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4956.0s)]
*  going to be inflationary, which is going to make the cost go up for everyone. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4959.92s)]
*  Well, I don't know. But I'm just pointing out that there was a real price in terms of having this [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4963.12s)]
*  free trade that led to huge trade deficits, which is this vast American middle class of people who [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4969.36s)]
*  worked with their hands got put out of work. And I think that removes a huge incentive for people to [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4975.36s)]
*  be invested in, to have a vested interest in the free market system. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4982.24s)]
*  Sachs, let me ask you one more question. Do you think that the Biden administration's bills, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4986.8s)]
*  the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act, both of which were meant to revitalize that middle [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4992.48s)]
*  class kind of industrial economy through government funding of developing new facilities in the U.S. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=4999.12s)]
*  to onshore manufacturing, is that not a good, reasonable solution to that problem? [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5005.28s)]
*  Well, those are two very different bills. I mean, the Inflation Reduction Act, just the name itself [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5010.48s)]
*  should tell you that it doesn't do it. I was joking. It should have been the [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5014.719999999999s)]
*  Inflation Maximization Act, the INA. Yeah, look, who benefited from that? [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5018.08s)]
*  Our friends who are energy investors, who you know who I'm talking about. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5022.0s)]
*  Stray bullets everywhere. No, I'm not going to say his name. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5029.04s)]
*  Take it easy over there. Take it easy. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5032.4s)]
*  So he's taking a strike. But his nickname is Deep State. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5034.32s)]
*  But he's an energy investor. He said that this bill was the biggest bonanza that they've ever seen. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5038.24s)]
*  These guys were running around like, you know, it was like the Beverly Hillbillies where they [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5045.5199999999995s)]
*  struck a gusher and they're running around with cans trying to collect the oil. That's what he [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5050.719999999999s)]
*  basically said this was. But it was a bunch of energy investors at Stanford. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5055.04s)]
*  The manna was coming down from heaven and they're just going to collect as much of it. That was a [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5060.4s)]
*  huge boondoggle and payoff for these green energy investors. That's who it went to. It did not [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5064.4s)]
*  benefit the middle class at all. What about the Chips Act? [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5069.04s)]
*  The Chips Act is more complicated because it does create incentives for manufacturing in America. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5071.599999999999s)]
*  And moreover, there is a national security element to it because we need these advanced [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5078.5599999999995s)]
*  chips. We can't be totally dependent on chip makers who are in foreign places within 100 miles of the [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5083.12s)]
*  Chinese mainland. That one's a little more complicated. Meanwhile, Intel is imploding. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5090.4s)]
*  Just to finish the thought, the issue with the Chips Act is that there's a lot of good reasons [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5098.0s)]
*  to believe that even if we incentivize this, we're still hopelessly behind. And the chip fabs that [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5102.799999999999s)]
*  we're building are just, they're still years behind what they have in Taiwan, for example. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5109.2s)]
*  So it's not clear it's going to work is my point. But I think the motivations make a lot more sense. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5113.2s)]
*  All right, everybody. This has been another amazing episode of the All In Podcast. Socialism [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5118.48s)]
*  is garbage and it turns into communism. No, I'm exacerbated. I mean, if Kamala doesn't get out [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5125.44s)]
*  there and start doing some interviews and explaining herself, I'm out. I mean, I'm out. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5133.2s)]
*  Wow. Making news. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5137.84s)]
*  Making news. I'm so frustrated right now. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5141.2s)]
*  I'm just frustrated. I'm literally going to smash this laptop with my tractor. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5144.32s)]
*  Right when JCal was about to become a centimillionaire, she shut the door. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5150.08s)]
*  I mean, it may have already happened. Anyway. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5154.799999999999s)]
*  Oh my God, that's so funny. Uber rallied. What's the price now? [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5160.08s)]
*  $80. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5164.719999999999s)]
*  Uber over $60, you're going to get a much different answer. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5165.28s)]
*  We need someone to generate a meme. JCal at $40 a share. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5168.0s)]
*  It's $70. It's very different. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5173.12s)]
*  $80 a share Republican. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5175.6s)]
*  No, I mean, we need to get Kamala on this program here. Face the music. Let's go. You want to run [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5178.32s)]
*  for president? Come on, All In and let's talk about it. If she's not going to answer basic [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5183.68s)]
*  questions, it's disqualifying for me. Who's trying to get her? Is anyone trying to? [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5187.28s)]
*  She wants on it. I mean, she wants on it. But I mean, we'd love to have her on. We'd love to [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5191.12s)]
*  have JD on. We'd love to have Waltz on. Let's go. Let's have some real conversations about this. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5195.04s)]
*  By the way, can I just make one final point on that whole unrealized gains tax? [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5199.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's lunacy. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5202.48s)]
*  Best case scenario, what the CBO estimated is that would raise about $400 billion a year for [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5202.88s)]
*  all these tax hikes. That's only 20% of the deficit we're running right now. We don't get [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5209.12s)]
*  anywhere close to closing the deficit with all these tax hikes. What that means is you have to [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5215.04s)]
*  cut spending. Moreover, she's got a bunch of new programs to increase that deficit. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5219.92s)]
*  And we know that that $400 billion number is an optimistic scenario. Because like Jamath was [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5224.16s)]
*  saying, the rich people are going to flee, they're going to try and move their wealth into [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5229.28s)]
*  structures or places where it's hard to tax. I think it's actually more than that. I think [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5233.76s)]
*  what will happen is funds, governments, etc. for the right entrepreneurs with the right assets [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5238.4s)]
*  will help you pay the exit tax so that you can just leave the United States. And that's going [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5243.92s)]
*  to be an investment class that's going to emerge in my opinion, which is these organizations that [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5249.36s)]
*  will pool capital, sovereign wealth funds specifically. And when an entrepreneur shows up [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5253.92s)]
*  and they have $50, $100, $1 billion tax bill to expatriate from the United States, they will pay [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5258.4800000000005s)]
*  it for you. And the reason is they'll bring the jobs and they'll bring the know-how and they'll [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5266.56s)]
*  bring the future capital investment into that country. It's a very easy investment to underwrite, [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5271.04s)]
*  actually. So I would just pay a lot of close attention to the fact that capital flows [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5276.88s)]
*  are very fungible in 2024, and they'll only become more fungible over time. Buenos Aires. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5283.84s)]
*  Anyways, beautiful, beautiful. This happened in, by the way, this happened in France. I mean, [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5288.16s)]
*  they literally did this. They tried it. A lot of French citizens all of a sudden became citizens. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5293.360000000001s)]
*  That's what always happens with wealth tax. I think it's important though, you have to now go [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5298.0s)]
*  to the logic. If this is what people want, I think it's important for people to see the impact of it [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5302.4800000000005s)]
*  and then for them to have to change their mind or stay with what they're doing because it's working. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5307.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's not going to work. You're right, J. Cal. In France and Norway, this was tried. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5311.44s)]
*  Every time wealth taxes get tried, what happens is the wealth flees and you never raise as much [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5315.759999999999s)]
*  as you think you're going to. And then what happens is in order to raise that money, they have to [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5321.2s)]
*  apply it to more people. Elizabeth Warren already wants to apply it to Americans with a net worth of [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5325.12s)]
*  50 million, not 100 million. So this whole idea that, well, this won't affect me because I'm not [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5329.44s)]
*  one of those rich people. The IRS was created and when they created the income tax, it was originally [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5333.919999999999s)]
*  only supposed to apply to less than the top 1%. Okay, I got to go. Love you guys. So everybody, [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpGiFqL8_E&t=5338.72s)]
