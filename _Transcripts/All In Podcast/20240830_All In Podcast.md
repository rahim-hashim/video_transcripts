*  And he's not happy about it, but the hair looks great. He still got a little sea salt [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=30.64s)]
*  From the yachting. I think I'm gonna try to keep my hair long. Let's see what happens [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=36.0s)]
*  Did you bring any of the sea salt back with you from the Mediterranean put it in a little bottle to spray or no? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=40.72s)]
*  No, but I do have some oil. Oh, okay. Great. And have you showered in the last week or is it still you got the Mediterranean? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=46.16s)]

*  I mean, it's like creeping all the way up [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=69.16s)]
*  Your neck looks like a prisoner [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=71.72s)]
*  And it said we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=82.12s)]
*  I walked here, but I had it totally unbuttoned and I thought this is completely inappropriate for Menlo Park in August [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  So I buttoned two buttons back in business mode. He's in business casual mode. He went from casual [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=96.52000000000001s)]

*  you know david, uh very quickly [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=166.7s)]
*  because he you know, uh has a you know, so strong learning curve as he plays these things kind of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=169.73999999999998s)]
*  Got the instinct of what the game we were playing with paypal was and it's part of the reason why [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=174.94s)]
*  I think you know each of the execs have had [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=180.62s)]
*  You know kind of key contributions to making [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=183.5s)]
*  um [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=186.62s)]
*  you know kind of paypal successful and david's was this kind of like [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=188.06s)]
*  Um maniacal focused on the kind of the the cycle of how the product worked on ebay [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=192.38s)]
*  um, and like [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=199.58s)]
*  Like there was just a whole bunch of stuff. I learned from him. It's part of how I track [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=201.66s)]
*  you know kind of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=205.26000000000002s)]
*  You know people I respect is what do I learn from them? And that was one of the things that I would say I learned from [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=207.34s)]
*  Uh david at paypal. That's nice david [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=213.18s)]
*  Tell us your first memory [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=216.3s)]
*  Of meeting reid hopman, which you remember where you were do you remember the conversation? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=218.54000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think when we met through peter, you know when reid [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=223.58s)]
*  I think reid was on the board of his infinity back then and then joined full time [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=226.70000000000002s)]
*  What were you like? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=231.02s)]
*  28 [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=232.52s)]
*  27 29. No, I mean, let's see. Um, this would have been 2000 [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=233.72s)]
*  I guess it would have been 27 when I first joined paypal 27 28. I guess something like that. Yeah [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=239.66000000000003s)]
*  99 so whatever that was. Yeah [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=246.14000000000001s)]
*  In any event, I mean i'll just to return the compliment, you know paypal had all these existential issues [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=248.38000000000002s)]
*  Where you had these larger entities trying to kill us visa mastercard [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=254.22s)]
*  ebay [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=259.02000000000004s)]
*  Who else? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=259.98s)]
*  Oh the less goes on city bank. Yeah [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=261.42s)]
*  and uh reid was was kind of our emissary who kept all these dogs at bay and managed to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=264.22s)]
*  I guess be friends with them. I guess to some degree even though they wanted to kill us [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=271.1s)]
*  And re was kind of in charge of making sure that these existential issues didn't blow up on us [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=275.34s)]
*  And they didn't so we got pretty lucky there. It's it's the will rogers line [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=279.74s)]
*  It's politics is the art of saying nice doggie while you hunt for a stick. Tell us like a moment reid [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=284.06s)]
*  that is [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=290.53999999999996s)]
*  Incredibly memorable to you from that paypal era [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=292.3s)]
*  You know some existential moment or one of more difficult or funny moments late night moments [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=295.65999999999997s)]
*  That would be indicative of that era and whatever was in the water that drew all that talent to one place [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=301.41999999999996s)]
*  Well part of it is that I mean this is you know, among the things I was learning from from peter [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=308.62s)]
*  Was that peter and max? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=314.94s)]
*  recruited just a [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=317.97999999999996s)]
*  Tremendous focus on on uh [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=320.84s)]
*  Like intense learning curves. So [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=324.29999999999995s)]
*  You know it was one of the things that peter later is like, okay [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=326.7s)]
*  I guess you have to interview for being on sports teams and so forth because this teamwork thing does matter [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=328.54s)]
*  but like high performers and it was kind of like a [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=333.82s)]
*  Like and that was part of the reason why there was such intense [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=337.34000000000003s)]
*  You know kind of innovation and capability [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=341.5s)]
*  You know probably the most stunning memory I had at at paypal is we you know, we're all young [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=344.86s)]
*  We're all first time or we're kind of doing a startup that matters [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=351.02000000000004s)]
*  You know kind of making this stuff happen [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=355.1s)]
*  And we do this merger with x.com and and you know like pre the merger closing [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=357.98s)]
*  Um, you know elon is is saying oh, I got this ceo bill harris. He's the best ever [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=364.78s)]
*  That's part of the reason why you should give so much percentage of the company to x.com and the merger [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=369.18s)]
*  You know da da da da and then after um the merger [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=373.09999999999997s)]
*  Literally the first meeting I had with elon is bill harris a complete disaster. We need to fire him right away [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=378.3s)]
*  Right like before we get to the first board meeting we need him fired and i'm like, uh elon you need to talk to peter about this [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=382.94s)]
*  Well, I mean this is decisive that's for sure [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=392.46000000000004s)]
*  Uh, all right. Well, let's get into we want you know, we're gonna go a little bit mullet here [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=397.02000000000004s)]
*  Friedberg we're gonna start with business and uh, then maybe we'll have a we had a fun meeting about that topic at a place [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=400.62s)]
*  In palo alto that no longer exists called antonio's nut house [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=406.78000000000003s)]
*  Yes, exactly. Yes the legendary antonio's nut house and when bill eventually did meet his demise [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=410.86s)]
*  um at paypal [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=417.90000000000003s)]
*  It was called the nut house coup [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=420.22s)]
*  He got whacked at the nut house [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=422.7s)]
*  We're on pool tables in the back. We're in the booths in the front [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=424.7s)]
*  Well, he wasn't whacked. He was whacked at a board meeting not at the nut house, but [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=428.22s)]
*  Certain plans were formulated at the back of antonio's nut house [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=433.74s)]
*  It's antonio's nut house is um [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=437.34s)]
*  Yeah, the most unhygienic bar in the bay area and then that's that's a pretty low benchmark. Let's just leave it at that [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=441.41999999999996s)]
*  We will start with some business here talk a little ai and then since two of our panelists have a passion [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=449.26s)]
*  We'll do the party political parties at the end [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=455.73999999999995s)]
*  everybody knows re was a co-founder of inflection ai and as a general partner at greylock and uh, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=458.53999999999996s)]
*  One of the founding investors also in open ai. There's a good story there. I'm sure [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=465.82s)]
*  And we just got results read from invidia results were good. They beat across the board [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=471.18s)]
*  Stock was down after hours [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=478.06s)]
*  Analysts said probably profit-taking putting that aside. We've never seen a chart like this in the history of uh business [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=480.78000000000003s)]
*  I would say data center revenue 26.3 billion 87 percent of their revenue now you remember invidia started obviously with [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=489.26s)]
*  You know video games and and didn't have a major data center business that has exploded net income 16.6 [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=495.97999999999996s)]
*  billion gross margin 75 [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=503.82s)]
*  Percent and here's your chart [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=506.52s)]
*  On a total basis invidia's revenue scale up is basically unlike anything we've seen [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=509.82s)]
*  But if you look their q quarter over quarter revenue over the past couple years things are starting to cool off significantly after that giant boom [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=516.14s)]
*  re what's your take on [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=524.62s)]
*  invidia's just incredible run here is it sustainable [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=526.9399999999999s)]
*  Will they have competitors and do you think this build out this massive build out we're seeing from startups to sovereigns? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=531.0999999999999s)]
*  You know to microsoft which are on the board of google apple, etc. Is this sustainable and is this going to keep going? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=538.3s)]
*  Well, i'm gonna ask that question unsurprisingly by many public market investors over the year [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=545.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and I said basically told them and say hey look it's sustainable for two years, which for you guys means forever [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=549.9799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, eight full quarters [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=556.3s)]
*  Yes, exactly. So that that's infinity right in terms of time [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=559.0999999999999s)]
*  um, you know, uh [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=562.54s)]
*  invidia has a very sharp, you know kind of lead on the importance of the the chips for the training clusters [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=564.62s)]
*  Um, you know, they're they're effective on inference [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=572.2199999999999s)]
*  But I do think that as you kind of scale the demand there'll be a lot of inference chips coming in [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=575.5799999999999s)]
*  Um, you know, I think chamath you're invested in one of those [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=581.5s)]
*  And I think there's going to be a bunch of those kind of coming in and and and the bulk of the demand [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=586.3s)]
*  Will be on the inference side and then invidia will have this challenge of [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=592.62s)]
*  Do I try to keep my prices and my margin? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=596.6999999999999s)]
*  Or do I do what why we like competition do I have to respond to the competitive market and then that I think will [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=599.82s)]
*  Will play out, you know start playing out probably in a year two at the latest [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=605.82s)]
*  And then kind of go so I think it's not sustainable. The the pure heat is not sustainable [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=611.0200000000001s)]
*  um, but I think it's you know, invidia has got a very strong position and and um, you know, I definitely [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=617.34s)]
*  I would recommend people not be short on invidia [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=623.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=626.72s)]
*  Yeah, there's growth left competition is coming and this is probably not the type of stock you would want to short at this moment in time [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=628.32s)]
*  Freeberg, what are your thoughts on this build out as well as the software build out that's occurring? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=636.0s)]
*  And when do you think we're going to see some competition come into the space? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=641.6s)]
*  I don't know if there's competition in the build out. I think we talked about this in the past [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=645.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't know if you guys saw these quotes this week or recently on [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=648.8000000000001s)]
*  we don't think about [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=652.96s)]
*  This build out in terms of roi gavin baker in [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=654.56s)]
*  Conversation on invest like the best is that the name of the podcast? Yeah, I think reference some conversations [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=658.6999999999999s)]
*  He's been having with the leaders of these companies [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=664.8s)]
*  Regarding the build out is so important because ultimately if you create this [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=667.8399999999999s)]
*  quote digital god [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=672.3199999999999s)]
*  The you know return is how many trillions? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=674.4s)]
*  So it doesn't matter how many tens of billions you're spending each quarter right now [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=678.16s)]
*  You have to get there. You have to make sure you don't miss the boat [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=681.44s)]
*  I guess read a question for you. You're on the board of microsoft still right like yes indeed [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=684.24s)]
*  As microsoft or sachia publicly talked about how they rationalize [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=688.6400000000001s)]
*  the investing [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=693.0400000000001s)]
*  Principles associated with building out ai infrastructure in the cloud [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=694.5400000000001s)]
*  Is it roi based like hey in the next two years? We're going to make this much additional incremental operating profit or or two [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=699.0400000000001s)]
*  We got to get this thing working right right to be more precise [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=705.44s)]
*  Is the investment driven by roi or does everyone just say this is so strategic [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=707.9200000000001s)]
*  We just have to win it and we'll throw all the resources we have to at this [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=711.52s)]
*  well, so [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=716.08s)]
*  What well one board members speaking for microsoft is [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=717.36s)]
*  You know is forbidden so i'm not speaking for microsoft speaking for me [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=720.88s)]
*  Right, um to all cloud computing platform companies. Yeah. Yeah, what's your sense on how they're thinking? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=724.72s)]
*  Just one of the principles in the microsoft thing is the company speaks for itself board members. Don't don't don't speak for [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=730.1600000000001s)]
*  Um, but you know, I think satya is like the best public market ceo of our [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=735.76s)]
*  Uh generation. Um, I think he is stunning [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=741.04s)]
*  In kind of blending accommodation of strategic insight with also kind of being you know, kind of return on capital [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=745.92s)]
*  you know sensible risk taking etc, and so [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=752.3199999999999s)]
*  The actual thing between your guys questions in terms of because I can comment on how satya thinks with this stuff is [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=755.1999999999999s)]
*  He's both thinking about like it's a platform change [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=760.24s)]
*  And you have to be there for the platform change for productivity for cloud, etc [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=763.04s)]
*  and [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=767.76s)]
*  Okay, let's rationalize the capital to when are we expecting revenue? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=768.8s)]
*  How do we get revenue sooner to to have that as a good productive cycle? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=772.24s)]
*  how do we [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=776.72s)]
*  You know be not trying to you know, just [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=778.16s)]
*  Spend like drunken sailors, which is easy to do [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=781.76s)]
*  Right, but but to to be targeting, you know kind of business outcomes and it's part of the reason why [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=784.64s)]
*  You know, they're like like, you know, he's very focused on what are we doing with office? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=790.4s)]
*  What are we doing cloud? What are we doing with you know as opposed to like you you you rarely hear him talking about agi or [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=794.56s)]
*  never digital gods [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=802.56s)]
*  Because it's kind of the question of I am I am focused on this in a business sense [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=804.3199999999999s)]
*  and I think that's that's kind of the way he's doing it but there is obviously a [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=808.4s)]
*  You know kind of a it's hard to predict the future when it's novel and unknown in platforms [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=811.92s)]
*  And it's part of the reason why you have all the hyperscalers [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=816.8s)]
*  now, you know kind of fully engaged and intelligently engaged because if you say well [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=819.68s)]
*  If even it's just the new platform by which you know kind of software everything with with with a computer unit in it [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=824.64s)]
*  Whether it's a phone or a speaker or a computer or anything else anything with a with a with a with a with a kind of [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=832.3199999999999s)]
*  A cpu or a gpu gets more intelligent [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=839.3599999999999s)]
*  Like you can't miss out on that platform [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=842.88s)]
*  And so that's that's I think the the thing that's motivating everybody [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=845.92s)]
*  but it's obviously you know how to do that smart is one of the things that [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=849.04s)]
*  You know everybody is you know, I'd say obsessing about every week [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=853.68s)]
*  What do you think about the open source movement versus closed source? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=858.64s)]
*  You are one of the original donators to open ai you were originally on the board [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=862.08s)]
*  And there's a couple of ways to go with this question, but I just want to start with [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=867.36s)]
*  Forget about the corporate structure over there. We'll get to that in a second [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=870.96s)]
*  But I want to talk specifically about [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=873.84s)]
*  Open source med estate metas obviously far behind open ai far behind google [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=876.32s)]
*  Microsoft so they went open source when you're behind you go open source, I guess is the idea here [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=882.46s)]
*  But they're making some big progress [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=887.6s)]
*  Who do you think is going to win this ultimately an open source provider of llms or proprietary? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=889.84s)]
*  closed source like open ai is and it's confounding to say open ai is closed but [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=896.8000000000001s)]
*  Closed ai [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=903.04s)]
*  Yeah, um [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=905.52s)]
*  Look from the very founding open ai was never claiming it was going to be open source was claiming it was going to be [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=906.64s)]
*  one safety open access [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=911.52s)]
*  And not differential or controlling access [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=914.0s)]
*  For that and I think that's they stayed true to that principle, which is I think what the genesis of the word open is there [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=917.2s)]
*  and [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=923.6800000000001s)]
*  Um, look, I think the key thing is there's going to be winners all over the place [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=924.4s)]
*  I think there's going to be winners in the open source side [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=927.76s)]
*  Um, and you know, I don't I don't know if llama is going to win from its open source thing as much as it's just [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=930.32s)]
*  Trying saying hey, we're training these models. So we're gonna, you know, uh put them out there because our closed system closed loop [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=935.2800000000001s)]
*  You know doesn't require selling for tokens and so forth, but there's also you know, mr [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=940.96s)]
*  All and other folks who are doing competent models [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=945.52s)]
*  and then I think that the [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=948.8000000000001s)]
*  Uh, but you know, there'll be wins in different ways. So it's not like I think like for example [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=950.88s)]
*  You know, I think there's going to be a bunch of different startups they're going to win whether it's coding agents or [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=956.56s)]
*  You know kind of very specific applications within medical or other kinds of things and I think they will [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=961.52s)]
*  You know generate big companies and I think large companies like, you know [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=967.52s)]
*  The hyperscalers are going to are going to succeed as well now in the pure model competition [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=971.2s)]
*  the question is when do we start seeing a a [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=976.48s)]
*  asymptote to scale [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=980.56s)]
*  and [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=982.4s)]
*  And my guess is and you know kind of the gbt landmarks is each order of magnitude [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=983.68s)]
*  My guess is the soonest will be gpd6 [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=988.64s)]
*  And it might not even it may even be after that and that's part of what the [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=992.64s)]
*  The bet that open ai and entropic and the hyperscalers are all making is that that that return to scale and then [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=996.0799999999999s)]
*  That has a lot of downstream effects because even if you say we can train smaller models [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1002.9599999999999s)]
*  To do effective things part of what's going to be really instrumental for training those smaller models is the larger models [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1008.16s)]
*  So like even if there's a bunch of smaller models that are specifically capturing other kinds of market opportunities [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1013.92s)]
*  Which is part of what i've been doing and investing in ai since you know, 2014 2015 [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1019.28s)]
*  You know, there's a there's a there's going to be a [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1025.9199999999998s)]
*  A set of those things that are all a whole bunch of startup opportunities [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1029.12s)]
*  So I think that's that the the a versus b is is is a good dramatic framing [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1031.9199999999998s)]
*  But it's really on which specific opportunities because there's going to be wins and opportunities across them [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1037.52s)]
*  Uh, do you think sorry just real quick? Do you think there's one? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1043.04s)]
*  um [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1046.56s)]
*  Llm or one foundational model [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1047.6s)]
*  read that effectively does everything like a meta model that starts to take most of the market or does [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1050.48s)]
*  different [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1057.12s)]
*  versions of smaller models or small agents that kind of network together [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1058.48s)]
*  End up being the best solution for specific applications and verticals [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1063.6s)]
*  Like how does this evolve over time like everyone's got this concept that there's a god model that does everything and wins [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1067.8400000000001s)]
*  And whoever gets the god model wins everything [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1073.04s)]
*  but the reality of software and [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1075.3600000000001s)]
*  Principles of biology would indicate that you'll see like smaller network things that are better at doing things than any one big thing [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1078.96s)]
*  And i'm curious to hear your point of view on the philosophy of that [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1085.76s)]
*  Yeah, I think the mistake that people make is they think precisely it's like the one model's rule of them all it's like saran's ring [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1088.24s)]
*  and actually in fact [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1095.44s)]
*  um [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1097.44s)]
*  Already today like for example one of the things that happens with all the model providers at microsoft and open eye [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1098.64s)]
*  Which i've seen is i'll sometimes sub in like gpd 3.5 as it was before [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1104.64s)]
*  To see what the answers are because there's a cost of compute even as you [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1109.3600000000001s)]
*  Learn and bring the cost of the computer the larger models down the larger models are always going to be a lot more expensive [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1112.96s)]
*  And by the way, they're going to be more expensive [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1117.92s)]
*  Kind of probably loosely under order of magnitude, right? So it's like well, it's 10x larger [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1120.64s)]
*  It's 10x more expensive. Totally and and so when you're trying to say hey i'm trying to make business models work [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1125.12s)]
*  Like language translation, right if I just want to do language translation. I don't need a massive model [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1130.8799999999999s)]
*  I just need a model that's really good at language translation [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1134.8799999999999s)]
*  Exactly. And so what I think you're going to see is is is networks of models and like kind of traffic control and escalation [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1137.52s)]
*  All the rest and agents are not going to be one model [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1145.04s)]
*  They're going to be blends of models and that's one of the reasons why you say well [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1147.4399999999998s)]
*  There's actually in fact a lot of a lot of room for startups because it's not like we say well [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1150.96s)]
*  We take gpd 7 and we just serve it for everything [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1154.64s)]
*  It's like well, it's gonna be super expensive and there's a whole bunch of [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1157.92s)]
*  Things about like serving it more cheaply and like for example [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1161.04s)]
*  One of the the really great technical papers that i love for microsoft is you know, all you need is textbooks [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1163.6000000000001s)]
*  It's like you can you can train very specific models on kind of like high quality data [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1168.72s)]
*  Along with by the way the larger model helping train it that all of a sudden you have a functional smaller model [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1175.68s)]
*  And you know that the question will be a blends of these things [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1180.96s)]
*  So I think the the the the multi model a model approach [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1183.6000000000001s)]
*  Is I think going to be you know quickly universal? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1188.32s)]
*  What is your take on ip in this new era? We uh see open ai and you're not on the open ai board anymore, right? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1191.44s)]
*  You're so you're independent of that even though you made a big donation at some point [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1197.6000000000001s)]
*  Donation and investment I led the the first commercial series first commercial round so you're an investor in it and you donated to it [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1202.4s)]
*  Actually, let's start there [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1209.44s)]
*  What's up with that? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1211.76s)]
*  corporate structure [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1213.02s)]
*  How do we make sense of that? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1215.04s)]
*  Something's a non-profit you donated to it and then you invested in it and everybody's making money and selling in secondary at 100 billion [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1217.44s)]
*  How does that work in the world? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1224.3999999999999s)]
*  so [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1227.36s)]
*  um, so it's it's a five one c three is the governor thing that's what started and you know when [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1228.1599999999999s)]
*  You know kind of elon and sam were starting this and said look we need, you know philanthropic support and [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1234.3999999999999s)]
*  We're trying to make sure that there's like open access to ai which is going to be an instrumental technology [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1240.0s)]
*  And we've got some great technologists who want to come do this [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1244.8799999999999s)]
*  We started as a as a you know kind of as a 501 c3 for doing it that that that persists [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1247.6s)]
*  As far as I know till today [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1254.24s)]
*  Then you know one of sam altman's, you know pieces of genius was that he kind of said look we're going to need scale capital [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1256.72s)]
*  And i'm trying to go out to raise and the commercial round was 600 million [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1264.08s)]
*  I'm trying to raise 600 million philanthropy and it's not working [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1268.3999999999999s)]
*  Right, so so I have this idea which is the 501 c3 which is doing this kind of research mission of you know [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1271.6799999999998s)]
*  AGI for humanity is also producing commercial benefits and we can create initially an lp which has a [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1277.52s)]
*  a kind of a a a revenue right on the commercial things that investors can invest in and you know [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1285.12s)]
*  You know read it'd be really helpful if you led this [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1293.3600000000001s)]
*  Because you know and I was like, well, but you don't have a good market plan. You don't have a product plan, you know business plan [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1296.48s)]
*  It's like yeah. Yeah, but you know, like we we need to show that we're actually serious with the business [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1303.5200000000002s)]
*  I said, all right fine. I will I will lead it from my foundation [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1308.0s)]
*  You know because even though none of these things we like to see as investors were there but I was like look, okay [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1312.0800000000002s)]
*  I'll lead it as an investment. I'll manage it as an investment, but i'll do as an investment for my foundation [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1317.6000000000001s)]
*  in order to do this and [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1323.2s)]
*  um, and what you know, you know kind of that was kind of as we were beginning to get in the you know, like kind of [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1325.3600000000001s)]
*  We we hadn't seen anything they were still doing dota and and robot hands and much of this [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1331.68s)]
*  So it was like we're betting on the scale thesis of generating something magical. And so we hadn't seen gpd3 yet [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1336.72s)]
*  And of course once that started coming then it was like well, we need a bunch more capital. Let's do a strategic [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1343.3600000000001s)]
*  you know, um [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1348.4s)]
*  You know connection and let's talk to all the hyperscalers and let's work out a deal by which one of them invests in us and [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1350.08s)]
*  And and then you know the the microsoft open ai deal came together with you know converting the lp into a subsidiary [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1356.0s)]
*  of the non-profit [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1363.76s)]
*  You know kind of saying look, um, there's all kinds of benefits that both open ai and microsoft can get from a business deal [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1365.28s)]
*  Um, and so that's that's that that's what's led to you know, the structure [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1371.04s)]
*  um, you know that I was familiar with before I left the board do you [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1376.0s)]
*  What did you think of elon's? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1379.84s)]
*  First lawsuit and then he dropped it and then he refiled where where do you think he's coming from? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1382.24s)]
*  Well, um [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1389.52s)]
*  What what is the uh, you know, i'm not very charitable about those lawsuits, um, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1392.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, I would like to be because you know, elon's one of the entrepreneurial heroes of our time and generation [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1398.3999999999999s)]
*  But I think it's the I think it's you know, frankly, I think probably most charitable thing to say is sour grapes [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1404.88s)]
*  um [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1410.3200000000002s)]
*  Because you know, for example, I know sam offered him as much of the investment round as he wanted [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1411.28s)]
*  Right, like he could have done the whole thing. He could have let it [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1416.88s)]
*  You know, it was kind of like hey look, we still love you. We still is and he was like no [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1420.0s)]
*  It's not a company that I control it's going to fail. So i'm not interested in investing and I was like, okay, right? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1424.0800000000002s)]
*  and so now you're getting these lawsuits that are like, you know, um, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1429.92s)]
*  Like I was misled and it was like you were offered everything at every opportunity [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1433.76s)]
*  other than converting open ai into a company that you you completely owned and so [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1438.64s)]
*  um [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1443.3600000000001s)]
*  You know, I think it's without without basis without merit [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1444.64s)]
*  But why do you think he would have dropped it and then refiled? Where do you think that comes from? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1447.76s)]
*  Is was is there new information? Do you think or I think it was a jurisdiction? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1452.0s)]
*  Oh that makes sense I got the fact that read I mean elon put in the first what 44 million dollars and he doesn't have [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1457.6000000000001s)]
*  any shares [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1462.72s)]
*  Yeah, I assume you're by the way put in 10 million at the same time and I don't have any shares from those 10 million [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1464.4s)]
*  But do you think that he kind of got screwed because he doesn't have any shares [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1470.24s)]
*  I mean at the time he put in the 44 million. It was never going to be a for-profit now [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1472.8s)]
*  It's a for-profit a lot of people are profiting, you know, assuming the paper mark ends up being realized [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1477.68s)]
*  So he doesn't own anything [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1484.48s)]
*  I mean if you were the seed investor and put up 44 million in something and then everyone's making money and you don't [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1486.64s)]
*  Have any shares forget about the legal technicalities wouldn't you have a feeling of being screwed? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1491.92s)]
*  Well, look I can understand the emotion of that but like it's not like elon short of money, right? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1497.68s)]
*  And so if you go look i'd like to have shares like I did [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1502.72s)]
*  Invest in the other thing. I didn't get any shares for the 10 million that I put in by the way [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1506.16s)]
*  It's not just legal technicalities. It's actually really important that you're not doing private enrichment off philanthropic donations. And so [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1510.56s)]
*  You know, it's it's but isn't that what's happened? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1517.68s)]
*  um [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1521.1200000000001s)]
*  No from a viewpoint of [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1522.72s)]
*  They're held separate, right? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1525.6000000000001s)]
*  um, and so [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1527.6000000000001s)]
*  you know and the 501 c3 continues to to control the [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1529.6000000000001s)]
*  um [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1534.48s)]
*  you know kind of control the kind of the [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1535.52s)]
*  The the mission and destiny and so forth and so the question about its mission is still [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1537.6000000000001s)]
*  Is still guiding things and you're essentially investing in that mission and you recorded you recruited people, you know on that mission and so [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1542.24s)]
*  um, you know, I think that the you know, um [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1549.5200000000002s)]
*  You know, I think like I said sour grapes [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1553.1200000000001s)]
*  Uh, okay. So let's get into some political stuff [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1556.24s)]
*  First I want to get the ip question then I want to talk about lena con [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1560.24s)]
*  So how do you think about ip in this, you know briefly in this new world? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1564.4s)]
*  Open ai and new york times can't come to terms new york times caught them red-handed cookie jar according to [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1568.88s)]
*  Their lawsuit having indexed a ton of their content [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1575.0400000000002s)]
*  It's pretty crystal clear that their content's behind a paywall and that's how they make money [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1577.8400000000001s)]
*  I also subscribe to chat gpt. I give them 20 bucks a month [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1582.0s)]
*  Maybe 30 bucks a month for every employee in my firm [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1585.2800000000002s)]
*  And I get new york times content from there all the time [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1588.16s)]
*  I will ask it. What is the wire cut? I think is the best choice in chat gpt [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1591.68s)]
*  I get that and then I get the answer and I don't need my new york times subscription. I don't visit the new york times anymore [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1595.2s)]
*  um [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1601.0400000000002s)]
*  Feels pretty clear cut to me. But how do you think about ip should [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1602.24s)]
*  Uh an llm be able to ingest whatever they please or should they be required to get permission in advance and pay a royalty? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1606.72s)]
*  to content creators read hawkman [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1614.32s)]
*  Well as a content creator too look I think [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1618.48s)]
*  I think that it tends to be a little bit of a [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1622.48s)]
*  Look, we do want content creators to benefit economically from the work. That's part of the reason why we have copyright [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1626.48s)]
*  It's part of the reason why we have payrolls, you know other kinds of things that I think are [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1631.84s)]
*  Are very important and I think it's it's a complicated thing that needs to be sorted out now that being said [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1636.08s)]
*  I think we also want to say that we can train these models like, you know [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1640.64s)]
*  Like training is like reading and like reading things is you know [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1644.8799999999999s)]
*  Like when something's available to be read and you've engaged in the right economic thing for reading it. I think that's a [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1649.04s)]
*  Kind of a reasonable fair use thing. Now, maybe we update the terms of service [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1654.8799999999999s)]
*  Maybe we update, you know copyright law and other things to say, okay that now changes, you know [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1658.08s)]
*  I think we don't want to forbid changes in the future [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1662.8s)]
*  you know [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1665.9199999999998s)]
*  This is like one of the problems we get with it blocks innovation when we do that it blocks innovation and you know kind of hollywood [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1667.12s)]
*  It blocks innovation in music it blocks innovation. So you want to allow some new? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1673.1999999999998s)]
*  Change, you know changing landscape and I think this is a changing landscape that arguably is reading so I think that [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1678.48s)]
*  Like both of those things are true in terms of what do we what do we want to sort through? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1684.24s)]
*  I think that one of the reasons why this is kind of like, you know over like when I give advice to [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1689.52s)]
*  You know various news organizations and so I say look don't try to hold out for money on the training side of things [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1694.8s)]
*  Because you know, we're going to create synthetic data [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1701.28s)]
*  We're going to do all kinds of other things that are going to mean that no one's particular data is really going to matter [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1703.6s)]
*  What you should be is on freshness on brand on other things and we should work out [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1709.6s)]
*  Ongoing sustaining economic arrangements like that. That would be my two cents, you know suggestion for it [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1714.4599999999998s)]
*  And I do think we want to design an ecosystem that includes that and you know [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1720.2399999999998s)]
*  When I was involved in those conversations at open AI they they agreed with that [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1723.9199999999998s)]
*  Microsoft certainly agrees with that in terms of you know [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1728.4599999999998s)]
*  How do we make sure that economics are fairly apportioned and so forth for you know what we're doing for? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1730.56s)]
*  You know this phase of you know and ongoing but like, you know, there's a current tech new technological wave [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1736.48s)]
*  That's coming and how do you do that? So, you know, that's a messy answer, but unfortunately, it's a messy subject [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1742.56s)]
*  It's pretty messy subject. Yeah before we move to politics. I just wanted to [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1747.6s)]
*  Actually ask you about inflection. So is it still running? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1751.52s)]
*  Yeah [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1755.92s)]
*  and so what basically happened there was like some [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1756.96s)]
*  Transfer payment from microsoft and a couple of the people like and then it seems like whatever that deal was [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1759.76s)]
*  A little bit seems to have been copied by google when they did this character ai thing [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1765.5200000000002s)]
*  So just trying to get a sense from you are these deals? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1769.5200000000002s)]
*  to structurally avoid fdc scrutiny in terms of the building blocks of it or [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1772.3200000000002s)]
*  How how did you think about it? And what is the what is the pattern and the trend on these things? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1776.88s)]
*  Well, the thing I think that's happened was you know, very early days you had things like, you know [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1783.3600000000001s)]
*  We're doing an agent and if pi had launched before chat gbt, it'd probably be in a different circumstance [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1788.16s)]
*  But like chat gbt got the oh my god. Hi. Hi is the inflection a product the inflection agent. Yeah, and so [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1793.52s)]
*  so by the time that pi [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1800.16s)]
*  We got the the the trend right and the and the interest of the market, right? But we got the timing, you know [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1802.16s)]
*  Too late happens with startups. So it's like, okay [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1808.72s)]
*  We need to pivot we need to pivot from a b2c model to a b2b and we have a unique model [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1810.8799999999999s)]
*  But let's sell that to other people who already have audiences because we're not going to be able to easily grow our audience [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1815.68s)]
*  And then you know, once we had that as a conversation there were employees like well [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1820.64s)]
*  We want to do the direct agent thing and that's what we want to do and maybe we'll go somewhere in order to do that [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1823.6000000000001s)]
*  And we're like, okay [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1828.16s)]
*  How do we fund this and how do we make that work and how do we make it work for investors? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1828.88s)]
*  And we said hey, there's a deal structure that could work which is [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1832.16s)]
*  You know with a you know, kind of outside party [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1835.2s)]
*  You can get paid enough in a non-exclusive ip license and an ability to selectively hire folks [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1837.92s)]
*  And then you can dividend some of that out to investors so investors, you know get back a you know [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1844.64s)]
*  kind of a 1x [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1849.28s)]
*  and then kind of a [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1850.88s)]
*  Ongoing position so, you know as investors, it's great to have a kind of optionality on its b2b business [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1852.56s)]
*  In order to play that out and this is a structure that works for everybody in this pivot to b2b and that's essentially the [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1858.88s)]
*  The the structure that we did. I see great pivot chamoth into lena con [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1865.52s)]
*  I think one of the things that is quite paradoxical [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1871.2s)]
*  Paradoxical about your relationship with david sachs as you both agree on something in politics, which is lena con [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1874.32s)]
*  and her concepts around future competition [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1881.4399999999998s)]
*  and maybe how she's [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1884.8799999999999s)]
*  Running this issue for the united states is leading [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1886.6399999999999s)]
*  to [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1890.72s)]
*  Basically a freeze on the market. We're seeing weird deal structures [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1891.76s)]
*  like some of the ones we're talking about here that could have just been acquisitions [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1895.2s)]
*  and [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1899.4399999999998s)]
*  I'm curious your thoughts on [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1900.8s)]
*  What she you know, this sort of breakup of google [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1903.36s)]
*  Now we're seeing that emerge at the same time that they're facing the biggest existential crisis of their career, which is [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1906.6399999999999s)]
*  Language models competing with them and I mean I would say half of my google searches have already moved [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1914.0s)]
*  To you know, uh, you know chat gpt like services [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1919.84s)]
*  So what's your take on lena con's approach to mna and what impact if it's continued and sustained? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1923.44s)]
*  Will that have on capital allocation because I I don't know what happened to the single and double mna [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1931.2s)]
*  Market, but it seems to be completely gone everything from adobe and figma [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1936.72s)]
*  To other mergers that could be happening are essentially frozen. So what's your take? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1942.3200000000002s)]
*  So it was funny because I kind of made an off the cuff, you know [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1948.5600000000002s)]
*  Kind of remark about lena con would turn an all news cycle. I saw you on cnn where they were like are you telling? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1951.8400000000001s)]
*  Kamala and biden what they have to do and I'm like no because I don't believe in that kind of corruption of [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1958.08s)]
*  Politics the only way she's to learn about it is either she asked me or she watches this television show [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1964.56s)]
*  um and um and so [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1969.68s)]
*  So she's done a good job on the price cartels [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1972.8s)]
*  She did a good job on the anti-competes both of which I think are very good for you know competitive markets [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1974.8799999999999s)]
*  the problem is I think she has a misunderstanding of these uh large tech companies and [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1979.6s)]
*  Um, for example on the mna thing [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1985.0400000000002s)]
*  You know her theory is you got to prevent the aggregation of power [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1987.6000000000001s)]
*  So you got to you know fight every acquisition? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1990.5600000000002s)]
*  Of note and the problem of course is that actually quells venture capital investment because it's like, okay [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1993.0400000000002s)]
*  Um part of the returns is if i'm going to invest in something [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=1999.3600000000001s)]
*  That might be competing with you know [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2003.68s)]
*  One or more of the large tech companies [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2006.8000000000002s)]
*  I need to have acquisition [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2009.2s)]
*  Exits as part of being able to fund enough capital to really make that acquisition [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2011.2s)]
*  You know that that that investment possibly because if it doesn't work [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2016.32s)]
*  I want to be able to at least return recover my capital by an investment [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2018.8799999999999s)]
*  So the right way to look at it is is there competition? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2022.8s)]
*  Amongst the top tech companies because you know if one of them is like squashing all the other ones [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2026.24s)]
*  That's a problem if we're if we're five large tech companies heading to three then i'm much more sympathetic to our point of view [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2030.8s)]
*  But we're actually five heading to ten, right or five to seven heading to 12 [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2037.2s)]
*  Because like invidia is now in the mix and and others I think is coming in the mix is you know now over 500 billion [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2041.68s)]
*  Yeah, yes [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2047.2800000000002s)]
*  And so you you have this ability and so the thing is is they're competing [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2048.32s)]
*  On the acquisitions just like they're competing in the market in the marketplace [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2052.32s)]
*  And if you're trying to quell the whole thing because your theory is [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2055.6800000000003s)]
*  Like like they should just you know [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2059.76s)]
*  The startup should just be able to grow up to compete [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2061.36s)]
*  That actually means that those will never get the capital that they need in order to do that [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2063.6800000000003s)]
*  Which means you're actually having the opposite of your intent, right? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2067.52s)]
*  What you're doing is you're actually making there to be less competition [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2071.6s)]
*  Because you know capitalists can't say if i'm going to put 100 million 500 million a billion dollars into this company [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2075.6s)]
*  I at least have a chance of getting my capital back or I can possibly create a competitor [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2082.1600000000003s)]
*  And that's that's the reason I was speaking out against it as an expert [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2086.7200000000003s)]
*  um [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2090.32s)]
*  It was like richerstein's that's right. I saw you I think it was a jay taper tapper who uh, you [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2091.2799999999997s)]
*  You kind of grilled you on I thought you did an exceptional job of just saying listen. I made a donation [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2096.72s)]
*  This is how I feel about it [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2100.96s)]
*  But obviously he's going to do what she wants to do and and that's just how politics works [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2101.9199999999996s)]
*  So, uh, I thought that was actually pretty well done and I actually appreciate you fighting for more mna because it would be great for the industry [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2106.8799999999997s)]
*  It's actually you want to throw up a political topic here. You want me to just just to stick on lena con for a second [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2114.7999999999997s)]
*  So I I agree that her approach has been uh overly broad and has had a chilling effect on [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2120.72s)]
*  Mna and so jay cal like you said we've lost those base hit [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2127.8399999999997s)]
*  Acquisitions that I think are important to the venture capital market that help new startups get funded [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2132.14s)]
*  I mean if the returns on risk capital go down, there's going to be less of it though [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2136.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so I agree with read on that the area where i'm not sure we agree is [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2143.8399999999997s)]
*  And where I do agree with lena con is I do think the big tech companies have too much power [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2147.84s)]
*  I do think that they are monopolies or have monopolies and I do think they need to be [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2152.32s)]
*  Controlled. I just think that you know, I wouldn't prevent them from doing any mna whatsoever [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2157.9s)]
*  I'm curious if read like agrees with that that the big tech companies have too much power or agrees with lena con on that [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2162.56s)]
*  And I guess specifically do you think any big tech companies should be broken up? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2169.84s)]
*  If so, which ones I mean I I would actually entertain that idea of [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2173.28s)]
*  Of deconglomerating or breaking up some of these big tech companies. Do you do you think do you agree that big tech is too much power or not? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2178.48s)]
*  Um [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2185.76s)]
*  I think it's tbd [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2186.88s)]
*  Um, but the reason i'd say look take the opposite point of view would say no [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2189.6800000000003s)]
*  uh the thesis for no [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2193.92s)]
*  is [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2196.4s)]
*  that they are [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2197.36s)]
*  Very strong american companies that get you know in the most cases over half the revenue from overseas [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2198.96s)]
*  They create [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2206.32s)]
*  technology platforms that beneficially differentiate the u.s [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2207.84s)]
*  Versus you know many other [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2212.8s)]
*  Countries in kind of global circumstances like the internet and other kinds of things [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2215.28s)]
*  Um, I think that they are competing ferociously with each other. I mean, uh [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2219.2000000000003s)]
*  You know jason just mentioned that you know [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2223.84s)]
*  It's kind of like look we've already got like chat gbt competing with google search and other kinds of things [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2226.24s)]
*  And I think it's competitive pressure, right? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2231.12s)]
*  This is I think what capitalism's about is competitive pressure that essentially creates the thing and that's the reason why like if it's [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2233.36s)]
*  if if we were shrinking like it was google uralis or I actually frankly think that the [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2239.6s)]
*  Everyone likes to talk about you know, google [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2245.68s)]
*  You're like I think the the prime candidate is likely to be and i'm speaking as an individual and as a venture capitalist here [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2247.8399999999997s)]
*  Is apple with the app store, right? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2254.08s)]
*  Okay, so wait so so that brings up an interesting point one of the things we've talked about in this pod [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2256.64s)]
*  Is that we shouldn't shut down m&a but the the fdc should [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2260.16s)]
*  Limit anti-competitive tactics by these big tech companies [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2265.2s)]
*  apple [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2270.24s)]
*  Really good example because they drive everything through the app store. You're not allowed to do side loading [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2271.2s)]
*  They want to take [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2276.48s)]
*  What is a 30 piece of any sales? You're not even allowed to have a link inside an application to drive [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2277.92s)]
*  Except in europe to the website. Yeah, you're up now you can [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2284.56s)]
*  Would you at least want to crack down on those anti-competitive tactics? Yeah, no for sure and look [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2288.88s)]
*  Especially when you know, we all know it's nonsense [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2294.64s)]
*  It's like look you could just give the consumers the option to to to allow side loading [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2297.2000000000003s)]
*  You could just say it's technically very simple to do [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2302.48s)]
*  And you can say look, uh, we we don't want you to sideload because we view it to be safety and security [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2305.92s)]
*  But we're giving you the option [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2312.48s)]
*  Right fine give people the option [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2314.88s)]
*  Right reid were you surprised that then? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2318.0s)]
*  The first target where there was like some successful anti-trust pushback was against google versus apple and then second. Do you think that? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2320.88s)]
*  There's a chance like a meaningful chance that [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2329.28s)]
*  The government tries to break google up or do you think it looks something maybe more similar to what happened to microsoft? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2332.0s)]
*  so I think [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2339.6s)]
*  in mandating breakups, you know like I think is a [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2341.44s)]
*  Look, I think we should operate through competitive networks and competitive ecosystems [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2346.48s)]
*  I think it's part of what smart about capitalism and I think mandating breakups is only when essentially capitalism is failing [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2349.6800000000003s)]
*  On specific things you want to do the the least [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2356.32s)]
*  The least you can [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2359.2799999999997s)]
*  To get back to competitive networks in terms of how you're operating [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2360.88s)]
*  And so, you know you say hey look i ios has this kind of monopoly [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2364.7999999999997s)]
*  You say there's no side loading you have to use app store. You have to use the payment mechanism [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2368.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, etc. Etc. It's like well that quells a ton of start of innovation [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2372.16s)]
*  We all know this as investors because we look at anyone who's prospectively doing a business like this and say no chance [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2376.08s)]
*  It's you know, you're not going to succeed [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2381.92s)]
*  And so so then you say well, what's the least thing that we can do? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2384.72s)]
*  Right and you know a classic antitrust like well, let's break off the app store from apple as well [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2388.48s)]
*  Right unclear that that would really fully work. You know, that's like socialism mandating how the thing should work [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2394.32s)]
*  Let's try to get it so that we allow competition [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2400.1600000000003s)]
*  To determine these things and like for example saying hey like you have to allow [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2403.44s)]
*  Consumers the option of side loading you have to allow consumers the option of installing an alternative app store [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2408.0s)]
*  Right like that kind of stuff. I think you know, what's the minimal stuff? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2413.84s)]
*  I think that's the kind of intervention we want to have because I think there's all kinds of benefits that come from [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2416.8s)]
*  why do you think that the [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2422.16s)]
*  Case against apple has made less progress in the case against google [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2424.16s)]
*  Uh, I think it's kind of it's less politically easy, right? Like it's kind of like everybody loves their ios phone [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2428.2400000000002s)]
*  And you know, there's there's there's less of a blue and red [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2435.12s)]
*  You know kind of combo tackle [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2439.92s)]
*  Where you know the the loopy people are like [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2442.56s)]
*  Hate big companies and all that's less offensive. Basically. Yes. Yes more stylish. They're they're prettier [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2446.2400000000002s)]
*  I kind of like your approach though with the app store if you were to think of least harm to the ecosystem [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2452.8s)]
*  Epic games has their own app store for games [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2459.12s)]
*  They charge 88 percent they give I'm sorry. They give developers 88 percent. They only take 12 [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2461.84s)]
*  And forcing apple to allow [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2467.6s)]
*  You know a startup to do an app store would solve the entire problem [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2470.0s)]
*  And it seems like that's where it's going to go and all five of us would invest instantly in an app store. That would say [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2474.0s)]
*  zero percent [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2479.68s)]
*  Take rate and all advertising based. What a great idea. That would be [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2481.28s)]
*  Yeah, great. I have a question [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2485.44s)]
*  a few weeks ago [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2488.08s)]
*  You said something to the effect very publicly that you had had a one hour or multi-hour lunch with biden [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2489.84s)]
*  And he just seemed like super on his game and then he was kind of dumped [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2495.68s)]
*  Was that just a moment in time where he was [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2502.4s)]
*  Really great with you [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2505.84s)]
*  Or how do you reconcile that with? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2507.6s)]
*  Pelosi and all of these other folks and what happened to biden? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2509.84s)]
*  Well, like most of us, um, I was pretty dismayed by the debate performance [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2514.32s)]
*  Um because when I talked to him like detailed thoughtful analysis with no notes on gaza questions about ai [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2520.66s)]
*  You know and what kinds of things you know, what did I think about what the progress you know? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2528.74s)]
*  The thing they were doing with the volunteer commitments the executive order and you know [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2532.58s)]
*  What kinds of things should happen in the future and all that kind of stuff being on the game a little slower, right? [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2536.58s)]
*  Then then you know a a 50 year old would be but but you know like cogent and totally worth it [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2541.54s)]
*  And then [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2548.1s)]
*  You kind of uh looked at the debate. Oh my gosh. This is this is this is a disaster [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2549.1400000000003s)]
*  um [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2554.9s)]
*  and so [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2556.1s)]
*  Um, it was like look is the debate a one-off thing as a did you were you ill? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2557.38s)]
*  You know like trying to reconcile the two and you know spent a little bit of time trying to figure that out [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2562.1s)]
*  Uh to to what was going on because it was it was the first time i'd seen something like that [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2566.98s)]
*  and you know, um, you know, I don't [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2573.06s)]
*  You know, i'm not enough of a dc insider to know exactly what the set of conclusions were other than I you know, I plotted [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2576.1s)]
*  You know biden for having the kind of integrity to go look i'm maybe i'm ill maybe i'm old maybe i'm slower [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2583.54s)]
*  But you know the it's about the country more than it's about me because i'm you know, not [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2588.3399999999997s)]
*  Um, you know, it's it's it's important to be about the country not about yourself [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2593.8599999999997s)]
*  I'll i'll step aside and ultimately his decision. There's nothing that anyone could force pelosi couldn't force it anyone else [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2597.8599999999997s)]
*  It's ultimately his decision he came to that decision so [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2603.3799999999997s)]
*  um, you know, I applaud that do you think that they should have run an open primary after that and [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2606.3399999999997s)]
*  Would kamala have won an open primary? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2612.5s)]
*  Well, it's hard to know [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2615.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, I think they were definitely leaning towards an open primary and then all the people who would be the most natural contenders [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2616.9s)]
*  all endorsed kamala, so [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2621.7799999999997s)]
*  And by the way, you say well kind of democratic process was like well [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2624.42s)]
*  There was a democratic process that picked the biden harris ticket which turned into the harris waltz ticket [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2627.14s)]
*  And so that's not anti-democratic [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2631.62s)]
*  But I think if you look at the sequence of events, it was kind of like well, you know [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2633.94s)]
*  We're we're going to sort out, you know what what we're going to do and then you know, all of the key folks, you know [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2637.78s)]
*  Shapiro and and whitmer and everyone else all endorsed kamala. I was like, okay, let's just let's get back to you know [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2643.94s)]
*  Kind of the the choice of two candidates and so I you know [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2650.5s)]
*  Do you feel the voters felt reed do you think the voters felt left out? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2654.82s)]
*  The democratic voters [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2658.5s)]
*  Well, I mean from post fact seems not right with the level of kind of energy and all the rest it seems that that that um [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2661.54s)]
*  That the [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2670.74s)]
*  That you know like the with the pure polling and kind of level energy and kind of what's going on [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2673.3s)]
*  They're happy with what they got. Yeah, they're happy with what they got. I would have liked to have that speed run [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2678.34s)]
*  Do you think it sets a bad precedent? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2682.1s)]
*  That they're not going to be able to do that [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2684.74s)]
*  That there were these back room conversations obviously [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2687.22s)]
*  the staff of whitmer more [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2692.5s)]
*  Shapiro their office speaks with democratic party leadership speak with big donors [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2695.4399999999996s)]
*  And there was effectively a coalescing that took place over a period of time that said [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2700.18s)]
*  We should all stand behind and endorse one person instead of infighting and creating a split in the party [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2704.5s)]
*  And does that not set a bad precedent that there is a small group of people in either party [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2710.66s)]
*  That in a primary process effectively get to nominate their candidate get their candidate to become the nominee [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2716.2599999999998s)]
*  And therefore there's only two people for the country to choose from and as we have seen recently with rfk jr [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2722.58s)]
*  And the lawsuits against him in being on the ballot in different states [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2728.02s)]
*  It makes it very difficult maybe for the people to have their choice [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2732.1s)]
*  And is that a bad way for democracy to work and I just love your philosophical view on this [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2735.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm like, what's the best way for democracy in the united states to work? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2740.58s)]
*  So [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2744.26s)]
*  For the president for the president. Yes, we do live in a republic. All right, and there right there is various [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2745.38s)]
*  Like, you know some people have much more influence than others [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2751.38s)]
*  whether it's media platforms whether it's [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2754.82s)]
*  you know economics and ability to spend whether it's you know a history and a brand and [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2758.26s)]
*  and and other things and so, you know this melee and and and kind of [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2763.6200000000003s)]
*  You know whole integration set of things now ultimately, you know voters are going to decide in november, right? [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2768.7400000000002s)]
*  So, you know people do have a you know, and I think that that that's staying to our democratic process [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2774.7400000000002s)]
*  Is what's really key like, you know people go on the polls, you know [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2780.98s)]
*  I think we should want to live in a country where everyone does you know everyone who is who is legally allowed to vote does vote [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2784.6600000000003s)]
*  um, and I think that that's [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2790.82s)]
*  You know ultimately a good thing now, you know, are there things that I would like to change? Sure [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2792.9s)]
*  I'd like to change i'd like to have ranked choice voting, you know, i'd like to have open primaries [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2797.14s)]
*  There's a set of things like like actually my principal frustration in all of this stuff is you know [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2802.1s)]
*  What's what's one of the fundamental things that the two parties agree on that? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2806.9s)]
*  That that that shouldn't be is that there should be only two parties, right? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2810.66s)]
*  And I think that's uh, I think that's something that you you need to fix and you can't fix it [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2815.7s)]
*  Unfortunately, I think with independent candidates because because the whole system is really set up [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2820.56s)]
*  Uh for you know, kind of two parties and independent candidates are almost always spoilers one way or the other [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2825.22s)]
*  I mean like on the rfk stuff. I understand there was a bunch of [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2830.8999999999996s)]
*  Democrats who were trying to you know, uh prevent him from getting on the ballot [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2834.24s)]
*  I actually prefer him on the ballot because I actually think his his his anti-vax stance [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2837.54s)]
*  Well, you know really fit very well with with trump [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2842.2599999999998s)]
*  And so I think he was gonna take more from trump [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2845.62s)]
*  Do you want to address that reed because I think there was a rumor that you were funding [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2847.2999999999997s)]
*  Some of these lawsuits to keep him off the ballot or whatever like have you spent any money to [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2851.46s)]
*  Try to impact rfk one way or the other [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2856.26s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if we look at all the money that goes to all the different organizations if organization x kind of had [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2858.6600000000003s)]
*  some kind of ballot thing [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2865.6200000000003s)]
*  My my voice instruction was always like no no don't do that. That's anti-democratic [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2868.1000000000004s)]
*  But you know, you can't control everything just like you invest in the company and co sometimes the dumb ass [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2874.5s)]
*  That you can't do anything about because you give money you give money to to folks that then execute their own strategies [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2879.4599999999996s)]
*  So you can't control on the ground tactics, right? Yeah. Yeah, so there's this that happens that you're like no don't do that [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2886.1s)]
*  Right. Well, okay. That's a good. That's a good segue [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2892.8199999999997s)]
*  Let's talk about the five cases against trump. There are five lawsuits. Hold on. Jake. I don't want can we just stay on this talk for a second? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2896.18s)]
*  I think this is important. Yeah, okay. So in in michigan and wisconsin [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2903.62s)]
*  You had democratic groups they fought [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2908.1200000000003s)]
*  Rfk juniors bid to get on the ballot. Okay, they failed [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2911.32s)]
*  Now he wants to get off the ballot, but they won't take him off [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2915.0800000000004s)]
*  Now that they think that his presence hurts trump [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2918.6800000000003s)]
*  And at the same time michigan's trying to remove cornell west and wisconsin's trying to remove jill stein [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2922.2000000000003s)]
*  So i'm curious. Do you think there's any principle on display here besides? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2928.6000000000004s)]
*  naked partisan hackery, I mean basically [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2932.84s)]
*  the democrats fought [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2936.92s)]
*  Having third parties on the ballot when they thought it would hurt biden [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2938.92s)]
*  And now they want to keep them on the ballot when they think it's going to hurt trump [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2943.88s)]
*  Except for those third party candidates who they still think will hurt harris [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2948.2799999999997s)]
*  So what is there any principle here? Is this just partisan hackery? I I think it's [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2952.6s)]
*  You know, I I frankly, you know think that everyone who follows the legal process to get on the ballot should be on the ballot [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2957.8s)]
*  And you know, we should follow the legal process [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2963.32s)]
*  I'm very much of a legal process kind of person what i'm opposed to is like, you know calling raffensperger and [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2965.96s)]
*  Asking for 11 000 votes, right which is not legal, right? So so like yeah, sure [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2971.6400000000003s)]
*  Is that is that bad and and do I advocate against that? The answer is absolutely yes [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2977.6400000000003s)]
*  Um, but it's you know, follow the legal process if the state of colorado throws trump off the ballot [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2982.44s)]
*  For example, is that legal process if it's that overruled by the extreme court or can we just say [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2988.36s)]
*  Substantively that states shouldn't be removing candidates from the ballot. That's anti-democratic [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2993.4s)]
*  Uh, well, but you want them to remove rfk from the ballot [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=2999.56s)]
*  No, that's not what I said. I I okay. I'm just trying to figure out [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3003.56s)]
*  No, the the rule is that well first of all, I don't think that democratic groups should be [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3007.48s)]
*  suing [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3012.44s)]
*  rfk to keep them off the ballot and that's what he said is that [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3013.4s)]
*  Democratic groups were suing to keep them off the ballot and they were trying to exhaust his resources [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3016.6s)]
*  So he couldn't mount an effective campaign [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3021.08s)]
*  And some of those groups you funded right? So maybe you didn't know what they were doing [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3023.4s)]
*  But in any event, I consider that to be anti-democratic [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3026.92s)]
*  rfk is now trying to remove his name from the ballot. I think as a candidate you're allowed to do that [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3030.2000000000003s)]
*  And those same groups that once fought [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3034.76s)]
*  To keep him off the ballot or trying to keep his name on the ballot because now they perceive [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3038.04s)]
*  Yeah, because now they perceive the political calculation to be a little different [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3042.36s)]
*  So mike, so I don't see any of this as being democratic [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3046.2000000000003s)]
*  This to me is just partisan hackery, isn't it? So can't show that [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3049.1600000000003s)]
*  Look, yes fundamentally from a viewpoint of like look, for example my my direct actions and yes [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3053.4s)]
*  There was you fund a whole bunch of different groups and you have different groups doing different things [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3059.88s)]
*  But you funded them to do this thing that you were thinking of and things happen. It's just like companies [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3063.88s)]
*  You know my thing was actually in fact making people aware of of rfk's anti-vax [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3069.0s)]
*  You know statement his anti-science stuff because I thought that would be relevant in the polls in november [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3076.12s)]
*  That that was the the actual strategy that that I believe and I think that would [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3081.7999999999997s)]
*  Differentially, you know hit trump more and so therefore would be a spoiler [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3086.58s)]
*  Right as these independents are i've no problem with drawing attention to issues [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3091.88s)]
*  But I I do think fundamentally it's anti-democratic to sue third-party candidates to the point where they can't be on the ballot [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3096.04s)]
*  Okay, let me ask you directly cornell west [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3102.36s)]
*  Um, there's an effort right now to remove cornell west from the ballot in michigan [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3105.56s)]
*  Do you support that or would you oppose that? I mean is that democracy? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3110.84s)]
*  By default, I would oppose it. I don't know any of the details. Okay, fair enough read. I have a I have a question for you [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3115.0s)]
*  It's more of a statement actually, maybe I'd just love to get your reaction [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3122.7599999999998s)]
*  One of the most divisive issues that we have right now is people's position on october 7th [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3126.52s)]
*  Israel palestine [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3133.96s)]
*  There is a sense that there's a growing [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3136.92s)]
*  kind of like [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3140.1200000000003s)]
*  virulent strain of anti-semitism in america a lot of people point to the extreme left as where that's really gestating [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3141.38s)]
*  there was thoughts that josh apiro would have been an exceptional candidate, but one of the large reasons why he was [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3149.6400000000003s)]
*  not really meaningfully considered was [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3156.1200000000003s)]
*  His religion I just want you to comment on the broad issue and whether you see it in the democratic party [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3159.08s)]
*  Whether you see it in the republican party, whether you see it at all just give us a sense of where we stand culturally on this issue [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3164.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, so like I know josh apiro, I think he's great. Um, you know, i've had i've broken bread with him [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3172.04s)]
*  um, and you know, he was meaningfully considered, um, you know, I think that the [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3178.04s)]
*  Um, you know, I think we should be so lucky that he would you know run for presidency someday [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3183.64s)]
*  uh some year [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3189.8799999999997s)]
*  um, you know, I actually didn't know waltz at all and and and you know was initially kind of surprised because [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3191.24s)]
*  You know, I was like, oh, I thought it was probably going to be shapiro and I was like well, you know [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3198.9199999999996s)]
*  I think it was you know, probably a close call down to those two and and it looks like you know, you know in making decisions [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3202.68s)]
*  I think [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3209.0s)]
*  Uh, you know harris, you know made a good decision with waltz. So [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3209.88s)]
*  you know, I think it's a um, you know now on the on the antisemitism topic I do worry that [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3214.44s)]
*  You know broadly, um, we're seeing [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3220.92s)]
*  You know kind of more rise of antisemitism [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3224.12s)]
*  And that's extremely important to fight [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3228.28s)]
*  um, you know, because I think and I think there are people in in the you know, it's it's a weirdly like like [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3231.56s)]
*  There's some lefties are doing it and there's some righties are doing it's both a blue and a red issue in different different shape [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3238.92s)]
*  and I think it's very important that we [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3245.32s)]
*  you know, we stand against that uh as a country and so [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3247.64s)]
*  um, you know, i've been uh, you know kind of mostly just kind of say hey look we gotta we gotta be anti [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3251.96s)]
*  Anti-racism antisemitism and also anti-genocide and we gotta figure that out. What did you think of kamala's? [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3258.26s)]
*  Uh handling of that issue in her speech. She basically [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3264.36s)]
*  Seemed to I don't know say both sides it but she said hey you can [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3268.36s)]
*  Uh believe that the people of gaza should be treated more humanely and that uh, you know, israel has a right to defend herself [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3272.52s)]
*  What did you think of her handling? I think that's rational right? Like you should be anti-genocide [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3278.92s)]
*  both of palestinians and of jews [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3283.64s)]
*  Right and and like like it's obviously a very very thorny topic. Yes, right. So [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3286.84s)]
*  Um, so I think you know saying that i'm going to try to protect civilians on both sides anti-genocide. I think that's a human [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3292.8399999999997s)]
*  caring place to be [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3300.2799999999997s)]
*  Looking out for people reed. Do you think that? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3302.12s)]
*  Generally speaking marxist socialist principles are taking a firmer hold on the the democratic party [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3304.68s)]
*  And kind of those principles are starting to showcase not just in the cultural [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3312.3599999999997s)]
*  Phenomena that that chamath is referencing but also in some of the policy making that's going on [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3317.3799999999997s)]
*  and [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3322.52s)]
*  concept of equity [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3323.64s)]
*  Rooted in concepts of social justice ultimately rooted in marxist principles emerging from the industrial revolution [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3326.52s)]
*  What about price fix? So so as an example the price gouging, you know price caps on food proposal [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3333.3199999999997s)]
*  the [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3340.04s)]
*  Concept of a wealth tax not necessarily the unrealized capital gains tax, but separately a tax on wealth [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3340.9199999999996s)]
*  All of these concepts of the degradation of power structure through policy [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3346.2799999999997s)]
*  And in part some have argued [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3351.08s)]
*  That the anti-semitism arises from these principles in that the jews are considered a privileged and powerful [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3354.4399999999996s)]
*  uh cultural class [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3360.04s)]
*  Is that is that not being observed? [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3362.12s)]
*  Do you not do you not think that there's some tendencies that are emerging in the democratic party and may be influenced? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3364.2s)]
*  By a louder far left and that far left is becoming more loud and better represented in the party [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3369.24s)]
*  Look, I think we should speak out against both the far left and the far right [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3374.9199999999996s)]
*  I think it's important to do both. And so [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3380.2799999999997s)]
*  You know since you know, i'm i'm i'm playing the democrat here on this conversation [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3382.8399999999997s)]
*  i'll ask you guys to play the the the or especially sax play the republican and and speak out against the [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3388.52s)]
*  the far right too [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3395.3999999999996s)]
*  But the the the short answer is yes, there are amongst the extreme left. That's not everybody in the democratic party [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3397.48s)]
*  but yeah, the extreme left there is [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3403.48s)]
*  Some like you know misunderstandings about you know, why it's important to do [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3405.96s)]
*  Defend, you know kind of anti-genocide is like from the river to the sea. It's like yeah, that's a genocidal statement [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3411.08s)]
*  Don't use that one [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3416.04s)]
*  Right that you understand what language you're using [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3417.48s)]
*  And and to be like look the you know, we've had a great genocidal moment with you know, world war two and we're still trying to recover from it [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3420.6s)]
*  to you know questions around like like what I think is a [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3428.44s)]
*  A a a foolish wealth tax even though it's by the way narrowed to like 80 percent and then on like the the price gouging stuff [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3431.56s)]
*  Um, you know, one of the things is I started scratching at it, you know was interesting [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3439.64s)]
*  I think this week krogrou said yes, we did actually artificially raise prices to profit from the pandemic [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3443.48s)]
*  You know, and yeah, you should stop price gouging [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3450.28s)]
*  It's not quite the same thing as price capping and apparently there's laws that affect even in florida, right or in texas [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3452.36s)]
*  where some of you know, uh [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3459.2400000000002s)]
*  You guys are living so like it's kind of [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3461.24s)]
*  You know, it's like okay. I need to understand this issue in more depth, but I don't think it's as simplistic as the political headlines are having it [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3464.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, but the reason why comble harris proposed the price fixing proposal price gouging [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3471.64s)]
*  Whatever you want to call it was in response to inflation. In other words, we've had 20 percent [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3476.2799999999997s)]
*  Erosion and purchasing power over the last four years harris needs a response to that [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3481.3999999999996s)]
*  So she came forward this new economic proposal [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3485.56s)]
*  So it's in that context this came up this wasn't some proposal by the far left of the party [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3488.28s)]
*  Unless you consider combo harris to be far left. I actually do but okay fair enough, but my point is just this is her proposal [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3493.88s)]
*  And it's in response to inflation. I mean you don't [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3501.2400000000002s)]
*  You understand what causes inflation, right? It's like the government printing too much money. It's not [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3504.52s)]
*  It's not greedy corporations raising their prices too much. I mean do you agree with that? [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3509.1600000000003s)]
*  Look I agree that you have to have good monetary policy [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3513.24s)]
*  And so I think we we probably agree on that and I think some printing of money is part of the normal functioning economy [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3515.88s)]
*  but too much is [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3521.56s)]
*  Is bad [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3523.16s)]
*  And I don't think look I think price it look part of the reason why we just talked about antitrust stuff earlier [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3524.2799999999997s)]
*  you do have to look at places where [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3530.04s)]
*  there's a there's a possibility of kind of commanding stuff from your [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3532.12s)]
*  Your privileged position and like, you know the like I want to go look we all agree [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3536.7599999999998s)]
*  We all agree that monopolies have to be controlled no, no, no debate there [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3540.36s)]
*  But that's not what's caused the inflation right because we've had inflation of commodities not just monopoly products [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3543.8s)]
*  But commodities like just food staples eggs, you know chicken stuff like that [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3548.6000000000004s)]
*  Driven by fuel and labor and all the other inflationary, you know underpinnings of those markets [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3554.84s)]
*  And I think we tried to highlight that [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3561.4s)]
*  I don't know if you saw elizabeth warren's interview on cnbc where she got taken apart because she made some claims about [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3562.84s)]
*  Profiteering by kraft heines and the cnbc anchors pointed out you were actually incorrect [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3567.96s)]
*  kraft heines has seen a reduction in profit over this period of time and so like there were factual inaccuracies in these belief systems [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3572.76s)]
*  But you know for me it feels a lot like the government setting prices in free markets is one of those steps towards [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3580.1200000000003s)]
*  socialist principles that worry me the most [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3586.92s)]
*  Yeah, and look I generally speaking as I was saying earlier. I'm like [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3589.7200000000003s)]
*  Like make sure the network sets sorts it out versus, you know centralized control totally totally [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3594.04s)]
*  So so it's kind of like you have to look at is there a place where you're like going? [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3599.96s)]
*  Okay, that's the reason I like focused her words were price gouging [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3603.8s)]
*  And if you're focused on the kind of gouging side of it is like there might be a market inefficiency that you're essentially [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3607.32s)]
*  Correcting then that's I think the same kind of thing [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3613.14s)]
*  We were talking about with like the ftc and the apple app store and so forth [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3615.64s)]
*  If it's like the i'm just going to set a fixed price on eggs [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3619.88s)]
*  Right. That's a bad idea. And by the way, there's there's bad ideas like the wealth tax thing that I that I disagree with her [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3623.48s)]
*  Her economic thing also had housing which I think is a you know, a good [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3630.12s)]
*  You know kind of thing to kind of lower costs for americans and you know kind of make that kind of stable work [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3633.56s)]
*  Like I think she's she's been good on immigration [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3640.52s)]
*  I think that's the the langford cinema bill which was from you know, the the the republican side was something they were fully prepared to endorse [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3644.04s)]
*  And you know trump killed it because he wanted to campaign on it [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3652.6800000000003s)]
*  It's like look we care about the actual running in the country [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3655.1600000000003s)]
*  And so you look I think there's a bunch of good things [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3657.7200000000003s)]
*  But if you said do I defend price capping the answer is not as an independent principle by itself [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3660.52s)]
*  And by the way, are there people lefties like, you know a lot of what elizabeth warren says about capitalism [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3666.28s)]
*  I disagree with right. I mean I could disagree with you on the border. I think you know, kamala [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3671.4s)]
*  Harris used to be considered the borders are that's gotten scrubbed [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3676.04s)]
*  I don't think she's done a great job on that but whatever that I want to go back to issues that affect silicon valley [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3678.52s)]
*  25 unrealized gains tax [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3684.1s)]
*  It seems like most of silicon valley almost all of it is either disagrees with this or is up in arms about this [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3686.02s)]
*  I think jay cal you would you said that this is disqualified. It's a line in the sand. It's just qualifying for me for sure [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3691.8s)]
*  Yeah, so I mean do you agree that a large unrealized gains tax 25% would be a disaster for [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3696.92s)]
*  Silicon valley and the whole startup ecosystem or I mean, how do you come down on that? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3704.6s)]
*  Well, as I understand it on that taxes that's proposed is you have to have [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3709.08s)]
*  Um 80 percent of your net worth. That's right liquid. Yeah, if 80 percent or more is illiquid [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3714.68s)]
*  Then no, you get to defer the tax, but there's a penalty [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3721.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you get to defer the tax. Yeah, it's a penalty. That's right [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3725.72s)]
*  Look, I think it's definitely a quelling impact and it's definitely stupid and definitely shouldn't happen [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3727.96s)]
*  Okay, you know [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3732.84s)]
*  Why isn't it disqualified why isn't it disqualifying the way that jay cal says are we just supposed to hope [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3741.4s)]
*  That kamala harris doesn't do what she says. She's gonna do i'll tell you why I think that both the republicans and the democrats [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3747.0s)]
*  Have realized [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3754.52s)]
*  That there's actually very little difference on a lot of the major things [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3756.1200000000003s)]
*  That they actually talk about so what they're both [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3760.92s)]
*  Being forced to do is realize that because the centrality of a bunch of the things they say are the same [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3764.1200000000003s)]
*  They each have to go to their flanks to get the n plus one vote [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3770.0400000000004s)]
*  and so kamala goes to the left and spouts all this stuff that seems marxist or [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3774.0400000000004s)]
*  Socialist or communist because she has to get those people [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3780.6600000000003s)]
*  to vote for her [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3783.8s)]
*  Ultimately, I think what ends up happening is [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3785.8s)]
*  Most of the stuff in the middle has a decent chance of happening the stuff at the fringes [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3788.6000000000004s)]
*  I think they get put up sacks almost as like a sacrificial lamb a good example [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3793.0s)]
*  I think is like all of this stuff that's happening with the student loan reform [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3797.5600000000004s)]
*  A half a trillion dollar plan it gets shot down by the supreme court this new plan another hundred billion dollars [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3802.04s)]
*  Not even being heard yet by the supreme court. So I think they know this [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3808.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it's not like the biden administration is dumb. The trump administration is not them either [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3812.44s)]
*  I think what they're doing is 10 million people would be an example on the right and taking away a woman's right to choose [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3817.24s)]
*  Would be the other one [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3822.2s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, one of the things you keep bringing that up [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3823.88s)]
*  But trump has said that he would veto he would not support a national ban. I'm talking about him already doing it [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3826.36s)]
*  He already he already overturned movie. I'm talking about that. Yeah, and by the way, just returning issue to the states [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3831.88s)]
*  It's not outlawing abortion. And by the way at the same level in austin [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3836.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, but that's [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3843.24s)]
*  They've not a ballot initiative there just about everywhere there's been a ballot initiative the pro-choice forces have won [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3847.16s)]
*  And besides that's a state issue now jacob not federal [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3852.52s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's a state issue and trump succeeded in taking away a woman's right to choose in texas [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3855.24s)]
*  But one thing by the way, look in the spirit of the all-in podcast [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3859.3199999999997s)]
*  I wanted to be clear about like there's there's there's stuff on the on the dems [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3862.04s)]
*  And some of their economic policy for the far left people that you know kind of you know [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3866.52s)]
*  They're advocating for that i'm opposed to you know sax i'd love to hear from you [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3870.52s)]
*  What parts of trump's thing you're opposed to? [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3874.52s)]
*  Here we go. Well, I mean I have been consistent on this pod for years that I thought that the [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3877.16s)]
*  Let's call it the like extreme pro-life side was not good for the republican party and i've been opposed to it [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3884.44s)]
*  I don't think it's what jcal says. I think that [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3891.24s)]
*  Overturning roe v. Wade did not abolish abortion. It basically returned the issue to the states [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3894.2599999999998s)]
*  And if you look at the referenda that have happened, they've pretty much all gone the pro-choice direction [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3898.36s)]
*  So I think that the overturning of roe v. Wade has actually allowed the country to sort of sort out that issue [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3902.92s)]
*  Although it's not completely sorted out [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3908.92s)]
*  But look, I would not support a national abortion. I would not support refederalizing the issue [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3911.7200000000003s)]
*  I think there's a lot of issues about you know war and peace where I do not support the [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3917.88s)]
*  You could say the establishment neoconstrant within the party. I do not support all these interventions [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3924.28s)]
*  I do not support these forever wars and there is a big debate in the party about that [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3929.56s)]
*  Now one of the reasons why at the end of the day I support trump [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3934.44s)]
*  is I know this will strike some people as [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3937.7999999999997s)]
*  Counterintuitive, but I think he is the moderate within the republican party. He's a moderate on abortion [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3942.98s)]
*  I know jcal you're still bitter about that extreme court case [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3949.0s)]
*  However, he's been very very clear that he will not support national abortion ban moreover [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3951.88s)]
*  He took the abortion language out of the republican platform. I think he's the moderate on [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3957.08s)]
*  On issues of of war he's he was the first republican candidate to run opposing bushes forever wars [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3963.32s)]
*  So I give him credit on those things [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3970.68s)]
*  On style he may not come across as a moderate, but those are style points. I think on issues [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3973.0s)]
*  He is the moderate the the issue I have with kamala harris is I don't think she's a moderate, you know [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3978.52s)]
*  So like just to take this 25 percent [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3983.64s)]
*  unrealized gains tax first [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3986.2799999999997s)]
*  When this issue came up we were assured well [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3988.44s)]
*  She doesn't really believe that even though it was in the democratic platform and it was in the biden harris budget [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3990.52s)]
*  then [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3996.2799999999997s)]
*  People said well, maybe it's part of her platform, but it's not a priority for her [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=3997.24s)]
*  And we just had one of her like top economic advisors come out on I think it was cnbc [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4001.96s)]
*  Defending it and her campaign confirmed [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4007.62s)]
*  That she supports it. Okay. So now the argument has become well [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4010.92s)]
*  She supports it. It is really part of the platform. She would do it if she could but she's not going to be able to do it [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4015.08s)]
*  I just don't think that's a ringing endorsement of a of a candidate [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4020.68s)]
*  I don't think you want to support a candidate because they're not going to be able to do what they really want to do [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4023.88s)]
*  Do you think she's a moderate or do you think she's a socialist? [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4029.4s)]
*  You know, uh going to take the country very far left by the way [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4032.52s)]
*  Yeah, but what sax didn't address is trump's tariff policy, which is also inflationary almost equivalent to the price gouging [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4037.24s)]
*  You know food price caps. I think that they're both inflationary and they're both bad policy [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4044.68s)]
*  That's my personal point of view, but i thought it was going to go but yeah anyway, yeah [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4048.52s)]
*  Honestly, i'm not i'm not sure what I what I think of that proposal. Um, you know, I guess it depends on the details [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4053.64s)]
*  What do you agree? I'm not endorsing i'm not posting it but but but just just back to this point that should we support? [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4058.84s)]
*  Kamala harris, even though we oppose [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4064.6s)]
*  All the policies that her campaign says she supports [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4067.48s)]
*  Tax [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4070.04s)]
*  Because it seems like that's the argument now is that silicon valley is expected to support harris [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4071.2400000000002s)]
*  Even though she wants and her campaign is confirmed. She wants a 44 capital gains tax. She wants a 25% unrealized gains [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4076.2000000000003s)]
*  Tax, these are things that I think the vast majority silicon valley considers to be disastrous for the startup ecosystem [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4084.2000000000003s)]
*  Should we support her in spite of those things? [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4091.6400000000003s)]
*  well, and why [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4094.36s)]
*  Look the information did an actual data poll as opposed to us being talking heads saying [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4095.96s)]
*  We say that silicon valley does x or y and you know the information's poll showed that there was you know, much broader support [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4100.92s)]
*  For the democratic ticket and the republican ticket. Just is that the thing that ron conway just tweeted [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4108.28s)]
*  He might have I don't know if he just no no no no that's that's different [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4113.72s)]
*  That was different that's different. That's a subset. Yeah, that's that's a that's a different group. That's a group to counteract you and chamoff [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4116.68s)]
*  Uh throwing us fundraiser for trump. It was like I think where that came from [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4123.8s)]
*  So so but the information a news source that that that ran a poll [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4128.92s)]
*  You know did it objectively ran the whole thing to try to answer the question came out with more folks in favor of [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4133.48s)]
*  You know the biden harris ticket than I believe why do you think that is? [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4140.04s)]
*  I believe that that is well because because look taxes is an important issue [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4143.88s)]
*  And I think if you ask any any silicon valley business person they say look lower capital gains promote long-term investment [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4147.32s)]
*  Ask me that's what I would say too [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4153.08s)]
*  But you know you kind of go well what actually in fact you most need for business is stability [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4155.16s)]
*  Uh rule of law not grifter capitalism where it's like, you know, give me a ability to launch my own nft [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4160.28s)]
*  Uh, you know, etc, etc [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4166.84s)]
*  That's what they go. We want that and by the way, we can navigate a higher tax rate [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4169.32s)]
*  It'll be less fast on growth and everything else, but we can still invest create businesses, you know, etc, etc [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4174.52s)]
*  But we can't do it with you know, kind of a uh, corroding the rule of law [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4180.759999999999s)]
*  Right, like, you know, I think both [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4185.879999999999s)]
*  David both you and chamath spoke out against the january 6th stuff. I'm curious where you're on that now [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4188.759999999999s)]
*  It's still top of mind for me [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4193.48s)]
*  That's the reason why the kind of the rule of law thing is my red line not a tactile [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4195.4s)]
*  So let me ask you about that formally here. There are five cases against trump [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4199.5599999999995s)]
*  You have the insurrection case you have the new york taxes case you have the hush money case [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4203.799999999999s)]
*  You have the e jean carroll case, uh, and um, what am I missing there? Oh and the uh documents case [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4208.44s)]
*  You funded like peter teal funded the gawker case, uh, the e jean carroll case, uh, which trump lost [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4215.639999999999s)]
*  and uh [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4222.12s)]
*  Just to ask you why did you choose to fund that and do you believe trump sexually assaulted? [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4223.16s)]
*  e jean carroll [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4229.16s)]
*  Well, it's kind of not relevant whether or not I did or not what I funded was an ability to have [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4231.4s)]
*  You know kind of a woman who doesn't have power who's being threatened by a rich man with a lot of money and power [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4237.0s)]
*  To try to silence her to have her day in court where 12 everyday americans [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4242.759999999999s)]
*  Right can come to a judgment and their judgment was [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4247.5599999999995s)]
*  Uh that there was an assault and there was slander about the assault [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4251.08s)]
*  And they did it twice and so that was the reason I funded it and you know, I think that that's important [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4255.24s)]
*  We you know the laws apply more importantly to rich and powerful people [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4261.639999999999s)]
*  Than it does to poor people. Um, that's that's the important about the thing. I love about america is a rule of law system [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4266.360000000001s)]
*  And I think that's what's most important and that's what's really fundamental. That's my red line [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4273.320000000001s)]
*  Relative to the kind of lines in the sand that we're talking about [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4278.04s)]
*  um, and you know, that's uh, [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4281.0s)]
*  You know, that's the reason why in the various kind of lawsuits were that seem to be that that's what's being emphasized [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4284.2s)]
*  Then you know, i'm i'm i'm happy to support them. Well, you know, I don't see I don't see [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4290.280000000001s)]
*  I don't see how its rule of law when you have a district attorney alvin bragg who's elected on a promise to get trump [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4294.68s)]
*  He then takes what are at most? [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4302.360000000001s)]
*  Uh a a bookkeeping misdemeanor that's passed the statute of limitations that's expired and he turns into 34 felony charges [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4305.400000000001s)]
*  On a legal theory that was never explained to the jury [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4314.280000000001s)]
*  And then basically trump is convicted [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4318.12s)]
*  in [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4320.6s)]
*  a sham trial [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4321.400000000001s)]
*  By a hyperpartisan new york jury system so that democrats can then run [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4322.84s)]
*  What do you think of that on the branding on the branding that he's a quote convicted felon? [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4327.8s)]
*  So there are there are four other trials we got your first one. What do you think? [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4331.56s)]
*  Hold on. I don't think it's right. Give me feedback. I don't want to get reach feedback too, but means finish my point [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4335.96s)]
*  I don't think it's rule of law when trump is prosecuted on a documents charge that biden himself is guilty of he's got all these [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4341.16s)]
*  Documents in his garage for decades [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4347.3s)]
*  Which the the judge has thrown out and we've seen a bunch of these lawfare cases where trump has ultimately prevailed [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4350.120000000001s)]
*  The judge has thrown it out or he's won on appeal [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4358.120000000001s)]
*  So that seems to me like abuse of the legal system for a partisan political goal not rule of law [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4360.200000000001s)]
*  Okay, so read there's four other cases two of them trump's been convicted in two of them are outstanding [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4366.84s)]
*  What's your take on the four cases? You've heard sax estate? [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4371.4800000000005s)]
*  So what's the two that he's been convicted jay cal? [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4374.84s)]
*  What's the other one besides the alvin bragg case? [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4377.72s)]
*  alvin bragg was convicted, uh, and then the um [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4380.5199999999995s)]
*  trump organization [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4383.8s)]
*  With the cfo, uh committing tax fraud he was convicted in that one as well [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4385.5599999999995s)]
*  Or the trump organization was convicted and people say that's lawfare by la chicha james [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4389.88s)]
*  So guilty guilty guilty in those three of five. So what's your take on the four that we haven't discussed yet and heard your opinion on? [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4394.36s)]
*  so [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4401.5599999999995s)]
*  Look, I think it's you know [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4402.68s)]
*  It's definitely possible to have [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4404.84s)]
*  Some versions of lawfare, although I think most people use the term when it's the legal process and the law enforcement that they don't like [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4407.64s)]
*  um, you know, I think that in the [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4414.92s)]
*  Bragg case you had [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4417.240000000001s)]
*  You know, uh, you know indictment and 12 jurors. There's jurors. I think as I recall one of the jurors said he got [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4419.0s)]
*  Uh, that that juror got their principal news from truth truth social. It was a unanimous conviction [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4425.8s)]
*  Um, I think that you know, you know you have vice president [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4431.160000000001s)]
*  Pence, you know comes out and says, you know trump asked me to overturn the election illegally, right? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4436.040000000001s)]
*  That's your own vice president [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4443.0s)]
*  So I don't think that that kind of suggests that there's this just rampant political persecution that there's a lot of fire where there's all [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4444.68s)]
*  The smoke doesn't mean that every single thing [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4451.72s)]
*  Uh, you know kind of democrats are trying to put trump in jail for 700 years. These cases are still outstanding [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4454.52s)]
*  They want to put them in jail reed. Do you think trump should go to jail? [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4460.52s)]
*  Uh, I think if he broke laws that says he should go to jail [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4463.8s)]
*  I think the laws apply to powerful people as much as they apply to everyday people [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4467.320000000001s)]
*  Right, so I think why why why were these cases? [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4471.88s)]
*  Why did they wait for two years on these cases so they could bring them in an election year? [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4474.120000000001s)]
*  Actually, I don't think if you look at the like just look speaking factually [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4478.6s)]
*  Trump's lawyers are always trying to delay the stuff, right? [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4483.400000000001s)]
*  I think they were trying to follow every legal process and trump's lawyers keep asking for [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4485.64s)]
*  Campaign this year instead of being stuck in a courtroom look after [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4489.72s)]
*  This was last year in the year before asking for deferrals setting out trial things like all of the stuff was from his side [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4493.24s)]
*  Trying to delay it if it got delayed into this year. That's a bad judgment on his his part [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4500.12s)]
*  Jack smith just filed new charges new charges and all this stems from january 6 in the wake of january 6 [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4506.12s)]
*  Merrick arlen's just department did an analysis of whether trump could be prosecuted for [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4512.36s)]
*  Incitement whether he incited that mob [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4517.24s)]
*  And the legal memo came back and they said no, we don't have a case here does not meet the legal bar for incitement [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4519.8s)]
*  Then it was reported by the new york times that biden thought [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4524.68s)]
*  That maria garland was basically being a wimp and they needed to go after trump [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4528.52s)]
*  So the hyperpartisan da or prosecutor jack smith was hired and he came up with a novel legal theory [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4532.28s)]
*  That somehow trump had perpetrated a fraud the american people never been seen before and since then he's been prosecuting trump and seeking to put him [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4538.76s)]
*  In prison and and when the stream court just kicked the legs out from under his case with a recent decision [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4545.4s)]
*  He just refiled charges [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4550.839999999999s)]
*  I don't understand anyone can look at this and say yeah look what happened on january 6 wasn't great [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4552.759999999999s)]
*  But the doj looked at it. It wasn't criminal [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4556.5199999999995s)]
*  But yet they've been pursuing this guy seeking to put him away for the rest of his life seeking to interfere with this election [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4559.32s)]
*  Seeking to deprive the american people of a choice [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4566.12s)]
*  On a separate track. You've got democrats in states like colorado literally removing trump from the ballot [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4568.759999999999s)]
*  Okay, read your thoughts [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4575.16s)]
*  So look the first thing is [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4578.200000000001s)]
*  Um january 6th, I think is a red line. I think it's you did incite a riot whether or not the legal then why not prosecute him for it [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4580.68s)]
*  Let's let re finish [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4588.84s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I was fair enough. Go ahead. Sorry [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4590.52s)]
*  right [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4593.56s)]
*  Um, so I think it was the you know, there was an incitement of a riot [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4594.280000000001s)]
*  Um, I think that the rioters went in and you know killed police officers were looking to kill vice president pence [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4598.839999999999s)]
*  You know from the court testimony courts are the best proxy that we have for finding truth in the stuff [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4606.36s)]
*  It's one of the reasons why you know, by the way, and when for example the supreme court says no, that's great [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4611.24s)]
*  That's legal process. I just have to fact check that no police officers were killed [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4615.96s)]
*  Where are you getting that from? [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4620.839999999999s)]
*  I think there were there was the one died from his injuries and you know very soon after and then no [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4622.68s)]
*  There was one cop who had a seizure later. It wasn't part of the the riot [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4628.84s)]
*  No police officers were killed as a part of the riot. I just have to fact check that this is not true [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4633.320000000001s)]
*  Well, then there's the the one who committed suicide too, which is a question of you know, I don't know how you can attribute that [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4638.360000000001s)]
*  yeah, so [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4644.04s)]
*  Anyway, so you got the you know the the the storming of the capital [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4645.96s)]
*  You know, he says these people are [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4651.24s)]
*  American heroes, he's gonna pardon them. He's gonna hire them into his administration [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4654.36s)]
*  Right, and if that's not encouragement for other people doing similar things, you know, wait, I don't hire january 6 rioters [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4658.679999999999s)]
*  He's gonna hire them. Yeah, I've heard that [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4664.759999999999s)]
*  Well, we'll we'll get you the the the the trump speech. There's all kinds of wonderful things in trump speeches [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4667.5599999999995s)]
*  If you listen, let me let me just move to one thing. So read I think [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4673.4s)]
*  This has been an amazingly robust conversation and I think you as always [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4678.04s)]
*  As long as i've known you now for 20 years have been really intellectually honest [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4683.72s)]
*  I want to ask you a favor which is can you stay for 10 extra minutes and talk with us to bobby kennedy? [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4688.76s)]
*  And the reason I want you to do that is I think that there is a bunch of misinformation [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4694.6s)]
*  I asked you about these things. I think it's important to hear [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4698.92s)]
*  Maybe from bobby and just for him to know what you said because I do think it's important to hear from the horse's mouth [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4702.04s)]
*  Can you just give us like five ten minutes so that we can do that? [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4707.24s)]
*  Because I think it would be an important thing to do. So when is that? No, just right now just we're gonna [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4710.04s)]
*  We're rolling into an interview with rock. It wasn't designed this way at the last [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4715.48s)]
*  It's just the last minute rfk jr. Who's on vacation? [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4719.5599999999995s)]
*  Said that he would talk to us about what it was like to kind of withdraw and all this sort of stuff [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4722.92s)]
*  And so we booked it right after you [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4727.0s)]
*  But he's in the waiting room i'm fine to do it. I mean it's okay. It's totally your choice. Yeah [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4729.4s)]
*  It's one of the things I like about your your all-in podcast is [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4735.0s)]
*  You know kind of like let's let's try to speak truth. Okay, right. So hey, uh, bobby kennedy is here. Mr [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4739.16s)]

*  Reid hoffman who you may know of but I don't think you two have ever met [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4750.6s)]
*  We have not [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4754.84s)]
*  pleasure to meet you [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4755.8s)]
*  Likewise pleasure [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4757.8s)]
*  Mr. Kennedy you dropped out of the race. Uh, perhaps you could tell us and I was quite disappointed about it [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4760.04s)]
*  I really wanted to see a third party candidate get into double digits again [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4766.04s)]
*  I just want to commend you on the effort that you put into it [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4770.12s)]
*  Maybe you could tell the audience why you as a reported never trump or join the trump team and dropped out [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4773.72s)]
*  So jason, I you know, i'm not actually [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4779.88s)]

*  the um [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4841.08s)]

*  And I I pretty much had a shutout [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4847.400000000001s)]
*  in the mainstream media [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4851.4800000000005s)]
*  so the mainstream media [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4853.56s)]
*  abc nbc cbs cnn msnbc [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4855.9400000000005s)]

*  I had only two live interviews [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4865.400000000001s)]
*  um [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4868.12s)]
*  Ross pro during his 10 month campaign had 34 interviews [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4869.32s)]
*  and then [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4874.759999999999s)]
*  You know all of them were very very much aligned with the democratic national committee [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4875.639999999999s)]
*  And so when they did mention my name, which was pretty often it was accompanied by a lot of defamations and pejoratives and [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4881.88s)]
*  Miscaracterizations, etc [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4890.9s)]
*  I never really had a chance to reach those audiences the audiences that I was reaching I was dominating and [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4893.54s)]
*  I was beating all the candidates on independence, which is now the largest demographic [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4901.219999999999s)]
*  I was beating them among young people. So your audience was supporting me [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4906.9s)]
*  Um the audiences that were listening to long-form interviews. I was dominating [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4913.379999999999s)]
*  But in the older audiences, which is a critical baby boomers people who really should have been for me [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4919.32s)]
*  Because they are people who from my generation who remember [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4926.12s)]
*  The kennedy administration they were part of camelod [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4931.0s)]

*  And I should have had good inroads, but I was never able to communicate with them [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4943.08s)]
*  Because they watch they get their news from from the mainstream media [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4948.5199999999995s)]

*  I mean if I was getting my information from those networks, I wouldn't vote for myself [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=4960.44s)]

*  Where I would remain on the ballot where we would ally ourselves [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5069.400000000001s)]
*  on certain critical issues [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5075.0s)]
*  But we would be able to continue to criticize each other on the issues and that we did not align on [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5077.88s)]
*  And president trump was very happy with that arrangement [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5085.56s)]

*  Ending the war in ukraine [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5107.5s)]
*  Uh, the second issue was ending the censorship [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5110.22s)]
*  And the third issue what most important to me [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5114.7s)]
*  Was addressing the childhood chronic disease epidemic and the [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5118.06s)]
*  you know these connected issues about soil health and [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5123.900000000001s)]

*  um, he was very very much aligned on those issues and it gave us [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5147.58s)]
*  Essentially a beachhead [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5153.26s)]
*  In which to construct, you know this an alliance [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5156.14s)]
*  Bobby, let me ask you a question [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5160.38s)]
*  I just want to go back a little bit because I I just want to make sure I heard it properly when cali called you [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5161.5s)]
*  Was it to be the vp on the trump ticket and did you [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5168.06s)]
*  Was that asked and did you consider it and why did you say no to that but then said yes to this [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5173.66s)]
*  Well, I had no interest in being a vice president if you're vice president [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5179.58s)]
*  It's a you know, I grew up in politics and vice presidents were shot in washington [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5185.34s)]
*  You have no budget. You have no staff except what your budget actually all comes to the white house [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5191.179999999999s)]
*  So if the president if you do something that [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5197.82s)]
*  Offends the president he can literally, you know, he can take away your plane. He can take away your staff [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5200.860000000001s)]
*  and he can the only thing you really have is the naval observatory, which is the [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5208.38s)]
*  Official residence of the vice president and he can essentially put you under house arrest [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5213.660000000001s)]
*  And you know, I have very strong views on issues and I you know [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5218.9400000000005s)]

*  of course my father who was attorney general and [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5386.400000000001s)]
*  A sort of walk away from that party [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5388.96s)]
*  was uh [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5394.08s)]
*  You know, I guess it was very very difficult for me and I was actually the last person in my campaign [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5395.76s)]
*  To see that to understand the necessity of that that a democratic party was not going to allow me [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5402.96s)]
*  to uh to compete fairly that they you know [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5409.92s)]
*  They had rigged the system against us in ways that were really quite extraordinary [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5413.52s)]
*  They had just walked away from democracy. They were canceling primaries. They had [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5419.2s)]
*  They had chosen their candidate and it was going to be uh president biden and a and I was really a nuisance to them [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5425.2s)]
*  And so my voice was not allowed out there [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5432.32s)]
*  and uh [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5436.8s)]
*  And so that was difficult [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5438.88s)]
*  and then um [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5441.12s)]
*  Uh and then leaving, you know, I declared independence in october [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5443.36s)]
*  And and uh joining trump [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5447.62s)]
*  Uh president trump was yeah [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5450.9s)]
*  I burned a lot of bridges. I burned my boats. Let me put it that way [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5453.38s)]
*  Clearly clearly is definitely um a challenging thing to to go from [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5458.18s)]
*  Your family being the bedrock of the democratic party and trump being [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5462.98s)]
*  You know, uh obviously seen as an existential risk by the democratic party [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5467.62s)]
*  So what what should americans? [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5472.74s)]
*  Know about the state [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5475.139999999999s)]
*  Of politics and fairness in america based on what you've learned [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5477.54s)]
*  What which what do you want the american people to know about the process of selecting a president? [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5482.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, and you know, I do want to say that I feel [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5487.7s)]
*  Like I didn't really leave the democratic party that the democratic party left me and left the um and left [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5492.0199999999995s)]
*  the ruins of uh [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5499.459999999999s)]
*  the [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5502.5s)]
*  The infrastructure that I think my uncle and father had that had made them democrats [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5504.58s)]
*  If you went on a list of all of the priorities that robert kennedy that john kennedy had [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5510.98s)]
*  I would check every box [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5517.139999999999s)]
*  You know, they were anti-war they were anti-censorship [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5519.139999999999s)]
*  They were they were against the corporate control of of our country [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5523.219999999999s)]
*  The this this corrupt merger of state and corporate power [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5528.74s)]
*  That had now has emerged as a dominant governing model in our country [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5533.14s)]
*  The democratic party has changed demographically [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5538.900000000001s)]
*  When I I grew up in a democratic party that was the party of the working class in our country that was party of [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5542.820000000001s)]
*  um small businesses that was the party of the poor [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5550.26s)]
*  In the last election [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5556.26s)]
*  President biden got roughly half of the country voting forum [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5558.58s)]
*  but that half controlled 70 percent of of gdp [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5563.7s)]
*  And president trump got about half the country voting forum and that half represents about 30 percent of gdp [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5568.1s)]
*  So we've had this inversion [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5577.3s)]
*  Where the democratic party has become the party of wealth of elites? [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5580.820000000001s)]
*  Um [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5586.5s)]
*  And I would say very insular elites [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5587.78s)]
*  and the um and the republican party is now the party of the poor the working class and uh, it's been [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5590.9s)]
*  You know for me to watch that i've been on the front lines [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5598.34s)]
*  of watching it and um [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5602.66s)]
*  You know the the values that held the democratic party together are no longer there [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5605.86s)]
*  it's held together by uh a [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5611.62s)]
*  A sense of tribalism a sense of and a great great sense of what I would say orchestrated fear [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5614.5s)]
*  Of donald trump. It's the only value that really dominates any discussion [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5622.099999999999s)]
*  If I talk about censorship to a democrat [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5627.86s)]
*  They'll say yes, but donald trump is going to become a dictator [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5631.14s)]
*  If you talk about children's health, they'll say never mind that donald trump is the only thing we can worry about if you talk about [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5636.26s)]
*  You know about the history of the democratic party's opposition to war [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5643.78s)]
*  It'll say forget all that. The only thing we can focus on is donald trump and uh [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5648.98s)]
*  That's a very very [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5655.54s)]
*  dismaying and I would say [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5657.599999999999s)]
*  dangerous form of [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5660.26s)]
*  orchestrated tribalism [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5662.18s)]
*  and one of the other features of the democratic party is this [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5664.099999999999s)]
*  this need to control this mistrust of the [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5668.26s)]
*  Of the plebiscite mistrust of the demos, you know demos is a [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5672.02s)]
*  Greek word for people and the democratic party doesn't trust the people. That's why they have to get rid of elections [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5677.22s)]
*  That's why they had to get me off the ballot. I got [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5682.820000000001s)]
*  Um, I I did something everybody said all the pundits said could never be done [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5686.18s)]
*  So I got on the ballot and every say I got a million people that signed their signed signatures petitioning me on the ballot [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5691.14s)]
*  And the democratic party strategy rather than to use the three billion dollars it had [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5698.58s)]
*  amplify a message and inspire people and talk about a vision and and the virtues of its candidates [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5704.4s)]
*  Instead use that money to try to get me off the ballot to get cornell off the cornell. I'll ask get jillis sign [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5711.22s)]
*  to use the courts to use the [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5719.94s)]
*  enforcement agencies including the secret service the cia the fbi [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5722.5599999999995s)]
*  to try to rig the election and it's exactly and [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5727.14s)]
*  It ultimately comes down to this mistrust of the people [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5732.02s)]
*  Which we're seeing now all over we're seeing the kind of two big forces emerge one is a populist force [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5736.58s)]
*  And the other is a force of control of ironclad control. We saw europe has already fallen [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5743.9400000000005s)]
*  You know you saw the arrest of pavl durof last week, which was extraordinary [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5749.78s)]
*  You know the the arrest of a [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5756.58s)]

*  Because he was hosting [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5763.9400000000005s)]
*  political dissent [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5766.900000000001s)]
*  And and and you know, the european commission is already openly [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5769.06s)]
*  Censoring content so they did not need to arrest him. They can take off, you know, whatever they want [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5773.7s)]
*  but they went through the [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5780.5s)]
*  to the trouble of actually [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5782.5s)]
*  And probably with u.s. Encouragement, you know catching him when he happened to land for refueling stop in france [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5785.06s)]
*  france has this extraordinary tradition of free speech that you know began with the french revolution and then again in the [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5792.66s)]
*  1880s they passed all these incredible laws [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5799.12s)]
*  their commitment to free speech is as robust as that in the united states and yet [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5802.66s)]
*  Now, you know and then and then two weeks before that [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5808.26s)]
*  You had this crazy european commissioner teary [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5812.42s)]

*  Yeah, it's extraordinary. That is what's coming to this country and you can already and a democratic party [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5834.26s)]
*  Is that the party of control and it's the party of not trusting the people? [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5839.86s)]
*  Let's bobby. Let's talk about something then let's assume that this election [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5845.94s)]

*  Mean, I it's the three issues ending censorship and that's pretty easy to do [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5869.7s)]
*  You can do it with a series of executive orders ending the ukraine war which is [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5875.46s)]
*  Complex, but I think done very very quickly [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5880.66s)]
*  And uh, and then you know the food issue now [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=5884.82s)]

*  Freiburg when you hear this some people might say, uh, this sounds like a grand conspiracy theory [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6173.14s)]
*  But much of it rings true to I think many of us who are parents watching kids [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6178.66s)]
*  You know and watching the prevalence of obesity [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6183.7s)]
*  Watching pharmaceutical drugs to counter that and all the money that's made from it and then seeing when people eat clean [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6186.66s)]
*  And they're healthy [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6192.82s)]
*  Maybe there there's less there. So free bird when you hear bobby's [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6194.18s)]
*  Uh position here as a scientist who sold the company to monsanto climate.com and who's working on food today [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6198.820000000001s)]
*  What rings true about what bobby's saying and what do you disagree with if anything? [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6206.42s)]
*  Yeah, there there are aspects of industrialized food and processed foods that are bad for people and I I do agree should be [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6210.34s)]
*  It should be changed [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6218.18s)]
*  I don't I I know a lot of people that work at the usda a lot of people that work [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6220.42s)]
*  In other government organizations that don't make a lot of money [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6224.42s)]
*  Um, they may or may not have worked at other companies [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6227.9400000000005s)]
*  But I think that there's no economic incentive for them to do harm or wrong [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6231.06s)]
*  I think that the real and so I don't think that there's a constructive design on doing bad things by any individual [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6235.22s)]
*  I think that there is an unfortunate circumstance where people eat bad stuff [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6241.780000000001s)]
*  Stuff that tastes better [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6246.66s)]
*  They like it more it sells better and the economic incentive in capitalism is to make more of that stuff and sell more of it [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6248.42s)]
*  and as a result the stuff that people like that isn't good for them they buy more of and the companies make more money and [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6254.0199999999995s)]
*  So they continue to invest in selling more and more of that stuff and this goes in most processed foods. It's terrible [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6260.0199999999995s)]
*  It's not good. And so I do agree that much of this processed food industry is [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6264.98s)]
*  Um [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6269.78s)]
*  Very adverse to health [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6271.3s)]
*  But I don't think that there's a grand design by individuals that are malicious in their intent and trying to do it [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6272.42s)]
*  I think that there are people that are doing their job on hey, this is what the market wants [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6277.0599999999995s)]
*  Right, yeah in the government and private industry [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6281.54s)]
*  You don't think people in private industry are trying to make addicting foods? [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6284.42s)]
*  No, no, I think that yeah, the point is like if people buy more of it [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6287.46s)]
*  They're like let's sell more of it, you know [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6289.86s)]
*  Yeah, okay [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6291.46s)]
*  And I you know, and if that were illegal if it was illegal to say hey this sort of food product should not be made [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6291.94s)]
*  But look alcohol fits the bill too, right and we we keep making alcohol and sugar fits the bill the more sugar [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6297.46s)]
*  a coca-cola did a study years ago where they um, they kept increasing the amount of sugar in coca-cola until [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6303.219999999999s)]
*  they maximally [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6310.42s)]
*  Uh got sell through so uh, some kids liked 60 grams of sugar and 12 ounces of coke some kids like 30 [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6312.099999999999s)]
*  But the perfect level was at 42 grams [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6317.94s)]
*  And so that study was done by the scientists that worked at coca-cola and then they said [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6320.74s)]
*  That's the product it sells it'll sell the most and that's the incentive inside of that company [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6325.219999999999s)]
*  That's how that company operates now. You could ask yourself the question. Is that evil? Is that bad? [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6329.219999999999s)]
*  We now know that sugar in general is bad the executives at coca-cola at ab inbev at other places are trying to make alcohol free [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6333.38s)]
*  Sugar free alternatives. So there's a lot of push by these people unilever has tried to [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6339.7s)]
*  Make a big push towards good food nestle's tried to do the same [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6344.259999999999s)]
*  They've all made these stated commitments to improve the health of the food that they produce [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6347.0599999999995s)]
*  But it is quite difficult to be successful in doing that and returning money to shareholders the shareholders are like where's the money? [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6350.5s)]
*  So, you know, I think this is the key point you're making and chamath [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6356.820000000001s)]
*  I think your clean food effort and it took me a decade to unravel me eating [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6360.42s)]
*  Everything in sight and lose the 40 pounds but chamath when you hear [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6365.54s)]
*  You know sort of this uh back and forth between bobby and frieberg [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6370.1s)]
*  What's your take on it in terms of and also the european lifestyle that you live for 10 weeks of the year? [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6373.780000000001s)]
*  What's your take on what should happen here and how bobby can be successful? [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6380.0199999999995s)]
*  I think what bobby says rings true in the way that I live my life and I just see it demonstrated on my own body [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6383.86s)]
*  You're right. Jason, you know, my wife's italian. She runs an italian company [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6390.34s)]
*  We she works italian and american hours for 10 months out of the year [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6395.3s)]
*  And for those 10 weeks we go there and we flip schedule [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6400.42s)]
*  But when i'm there i'm consuming italian produce that is impact in plastic [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6403.22s)]
*  I go to a local fruit store. I go to the local fish vendor [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6407.94s)]
*  And my body changes and I know that because the people that see me when I get back [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6412.98s)]
*  They always comment. Oh, did you lose weight? Oh, do you look you look thinner or this or that? [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6419.139999999999s)]
*  And what's interesting is I actually do a body composition before I leave and after i've done this for seven years now [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6424.259999999999s)]
*  and [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6430.0199999999995s)]
*  I can tell you that my weight doesn't change that much but my body composition is completely different [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6430.9s)]
*  And I don't know what it is except the things that i'm putting in my body that's different [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6437.38s)]
*  And so I see it and i'm running an ab test every day [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6441.7s)]
*  You know what's the price of the price of the food chamath like is it more in italy? [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6445.38s)]
*  Like you pay more do you think well i've already commented on the the fish is outrageous [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6448.98s)]
*  Yeah, um, but but there are ways to eat at a materially lower price than there is here and [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6453.94s)]
*  The access to the ultra processed food is different there [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6460.42s)]
*  You can't get the stuff and when you [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6464.26s)]
*  And when you do find that stuff, it doesn't have the same [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6466.820000000001s)]
*  You know glycemic and metabolic load on your body. I'm curious what you think of, you know ozempic in this category of drugs [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6470.740000000001s)]
*  Breaking the cycle. I think you've been against them or [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6478.660000000001s)]
*  They certainly helped me with half of my weight loss. I know sacs had a good experience as well [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6482.660000000001s)]
*  And he's been public about it [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6486.820000000001s)]
*  What are your thoughts on that because it does seem when people take the take the glps which exist in your body [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6488.18s)]
*  That they i'm sure there's more research that needs to be done [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6493.9400000000005s)]
*  They do break this habit. I know anecdotally with me [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6497.22s)]
*  I don't crave the foods I craved previously and it did kind of rewire my brain in how I [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6499.86s)]
*  Look at food even when i'm off of it. So your thoughts on those and those potentially being a way to break the cycle [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6505.38s)]
*  Yeah, so and this goes to david's point that you know, this is we need to have cheap food [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6512.18s)]

*  The problem is the food isn't cheap. It it's cheap on the shelf on the shelf, but it imposes costs on the rest of us [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6525.62s)]

*  To pass this bill that will make medicare pay for it [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6658.02s)]
*  For every american is obese that could be 74 percent of people are now eligible [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6661.94s)]
*  I think it's 1500 dollars a week [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6667.54s)]
*  The cost of that will be three trillion a year [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6670.5s)]
*  If you took three trillion a year a tiny fraction of that you could buy organic food three meals a day for every human being [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6673.86s)]

*  and you know, I [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6686.9s)]
*  What I would say is the you know the food producers it's not a conspiracy. It's just [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6689.0599999999995s)]
*  people following perverse incentives [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6695.139999999999s)]
*  And there are conspiracies. I mean when I sued on montanto [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6697.78s)]
*  We got emails that showed that the head of the pesticide division jess roland for a decade [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6701.86s)]
*  At epa was secretly working for montanto the entire time [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6708.179999999999s)]

*  It's a high the cursing nature of roundup [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6717.06s)]
*  So there are those kind of instances throughout the federal government, but mainly it says perverse incentives [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6720.9800000000005s)]
*  almost all almost [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6726.820000000001s)]
*  close to 100 percent [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6728.58s)]
*  Of our of our foods agricultural subsidies go to processed food. I mean go to [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6730.740000000001s)]
*  Commodity agriculture, which is the feedstock for processed food [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6736.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh, and then if you look at mostly mostly for mostly for meat [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6741.06s)]
*  If the industry [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6745.3s)]
*  controls [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6747.36s)]
*  through lobbying and through you know, all these other mechanisms for corporate capture controls [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6748.74s)]
*  the expenditures in the food stamp program so 70 percent of the food stamp program goes for processed food 10 percent [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6754.9s)]
*  goes for sugar drinks like coca cola [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6763.06s)]
*  Which are just diabetes machines. So why are we poisoning poor kids in this country? [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6765.86s)]
*  For the school lunch program the same thing almost 80, I think 77 percent of food [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6772.02s)]
*  Food lunch program is terrible foods that are actually poisoning our children [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6777.860000000001s)]
*  And you know, don't we you know, don't we care enough about our kids to say? [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6782.5s)]
*  We need you know, we we want to care about them. We want to make sure that they're not sick [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6788.580000000001s)]
*  They are the most precious things in our country [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6794.18s)]
*  Shouldn't that be the focus and you know, whatever we're doing to make them so sick [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6797.14s)]
*  When I was a kid six percent of american kids had chronic disease today 60 percent [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6802.82s)]
*  Is that not an alarm? [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6808.74s)]
*  Is that not you know something that we should all be concerned about? [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6810.5s)]
*  I will I will agree on an important point. You know the the the food stamp program the snap program [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6814.0199999999995s)]
*  provides food stamps to support [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6821.62s)]
*  42 million americans 42 million people rely on food stamps it costs 120 billion dollars of federal money per year [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6824.58s)]
*  and as um [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6832.98s)]
*  As bobby said the number one product bought on the food stamp program is soda canned soda [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6834.42s)]
*  And there was an important debate a few years ago about whether or not [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6840.42s)]
*  canned soda [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6844.58s)]
*  By the way, bobby you and I probably agree on a lot of things [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6846.0199999999995s)]
*  It's definitely a lot of things we don't agree on but like these aspects I think are just no brainers [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6848.099999999999s)]
*  Uh, there was a debate a few years ago about whether or not canned soda should be allowed as a purchase on the food stamp program [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6853.379999999999s)]
*  Or whether it should be fresh fruits and vegetables and grains and other things [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6859.54s)]
*  And ultimately there was a food lobbying effort to made [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6863.379999999999s)]
*  That kept uh canned soda on the food stamp program that it is [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6867.139999999999s)]
*  Again 120 billion dollars of annual federal spend with the biggest line item going to canned soda to [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6870.82s)]
*  You know feed 42 million americans and and the the connection is completely direct [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6877.54s)]
*  High sugar high glycemic index diabetes and other chronic health conditions arise from that connection. So, um [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6882.179999999999s)]
*  Definitely aligned with you on the the misincentives and the disincentives in these programs that have been created and they only expand every year [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6890.42s)]
*  Bobby, can you comment on when people talk about? [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6897.78s)]
*  revamping the food supply [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6901.04s)]
*  one of the things that sometimes is not allowed to be said is that [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6902.82s)]
*  focusing on organic food and produce can [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6908.0199999999995s)]
*  Exclude certain communities and so there's like this dei filter that preferring that is almost racist in some way [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6911.86s)]
*  Like can you just comment on that whole vein of thinking and your thought on that? [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6917.7s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think feeding people poisonous food is racist and by the way the naacp gets huge amounts of money [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6922.74s)]
*  Every year from the food industry. It may be one of the biggest I think I think coca cola is the biggest [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6931.3s)]
*  Supporter of naacp. So a lot of the ngos that are supposed to be [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6937.94s)]
*  Concerned about the the disproportionate [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6943.54s)]

*  And you know a lot of times those are the voices you hear saying this is racist [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6952.9s)]
*  What's really racist is poor is poisoning [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6957.78s)]
*  Black americans because these are communities that are food deserts [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=6961.0599999999995s)]

*  I didn't know that much about but I think you've put it now on the political radar screen in a way that it's not going away [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7104.2s)]
*  So I think you ran a very [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7110.04s)]
*  noble and effective campaign [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7112.599999999999s)]
*  And I think like you said it was a campaign for the soul of the democratic party [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7115.639999999999s)]
*  You know, I think you [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7119.88s)]
*  Represented issues that in the days of your father and president john f kennedy. These would have been democratic party issues [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7121.7s)]
*  How did the democratic party respond? [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7129.72s)]
*  They effectively ran you out they did not give you the chance they [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7131.8s)]
*  Conducted lawfare to keep you off the ballot. They didn't let you debate [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7135.240000000001s)]
*  I heard your running mate say that you even tried to infiltrate your campaign [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7139.08s)]
*  And all the while this party was claiming to be the party of democracy find that incredibly [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7143.08s)]
*  hypocritical [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7148.34s)]
*  I think that if they had given you the opportunity to debate I think we now know what would have happened [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7151.16s)]
*  I mean we saw what happened when biden actually debated trump is there's a complete implosion [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7158.12s)]
*  Of biden's campaign we discovered that indeed the democratic party had been hiding his condition [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7163.5599999999995s)]
*  For a long time and when he was finally forced to debate didn't have a teleprompter or script [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7170.5199999999995s)]
*  It became extremely obvious [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7176.759999999999s)]
*  What happened then they basically? [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7178.679999999999s)]
*  Put in a new nominee who's never been [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7181.16s)]
*  Voted on kavan harris has never received one primary vote [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7184.28s)]
*  It was done through a process that was opaque. We still don't know how it went down [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7187.879999999999s)]
*  I have to disagree with read that um biden did it in a voluntary way biden went kicking and screaming [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7193.08s)]
*  I mean, he basically said publicly over and over again. I'm not leaving the race. I'm in this race [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7199.16s)]
*  He tweeted it. He said it [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7203.5599999999995s)]
*  He said only god almighty could get me out of the race and then it was reported that nancy [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7204.919999999999s)]
*  Pelosi went him and said we can do this the easy way or the hard way [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7208.679999999999s)]
*  You said god almighty [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7212.04s)]
*  But the point is there was nothing democratic about this and now we have a new democratic party nominee who refuses [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7217.24s)]
*  to do press conferences [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7223.879999999999s)]
*  Refuses to do solo interviews [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7225.879999999999s)]
*  Refuses to take questions from the press who's hiding herself effectively [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7228.28s)]
*  And yet this party again claims to be the party of democracy [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7232.92s)]
*  I find it just almost um [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7236.44s)]
*  Maddening or galling again in its hypocrisy and I just I don't see how everybody can't see through this [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7239.24s)]
*  It's just not the way that democracy is supposed to work [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7247.16s)]
*  And I certainly don't think that the people engaging these tactics can be cloaking themselves in all this [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7250.12s)]
*  High-fluting rhetoric of of democracy. It's just absurd. And so [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7256.5199999999995s)]
*  I feel like i'm in the place that you are bobby [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7260.2s)]
*  You know as viewers of this pod no, I did not start off supporting trump in the primaries [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7263.320000000001s)]
*  I supported you in the democratic primary and I did fundraisers for desantis and vavek [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7268.120000000001s)]
*  And that was in large part because I think of the job that desantis did as governor [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7273.64s)]
*  But when it came to the general [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7277.96s)]
*  The realization that I came to is that trump is the indispensable figure in our current politics for marshaling this populist energy [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7279.8s)]
*  to resist [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7288.52s)]
*  this [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7290.120000000001s)]
*  radical [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7291.22s)]
*  elite authoritarianism [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7292.66s)]
*  That wants to engage in censorship over debate [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7294.740000000001s)]
*  that seems to want to protect and defend [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7298.1s)]
*  this [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7301.14s)]
*  Surveillance state over anything it wants to do that wants to keep all these wars going [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7302.18s)]
*  Even when they don't make sense when we could have found a way to negotiate a diplomatic end to them [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7306.820000000001s)]
*  And so i'm kind of delighted that you've kind of come around to this opinion too [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7312.18s)]
*  I know you have your reservations about trump. I'm not saying that trump is perfect. I mean, I think he's a [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7315.54s)]
*  Uh, he's human. I mean he's a flawed vessel [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7320.26s)]
*  But at the end of the day he is the the choice that represents again these populist forces resisting authoritarianism [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7322.02s)]
*  Sorry, this is more of a statement than a question, but i'll let you react to all of that [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7329.54s)]
*  Well, let me react to the last thing you said about president trump. I think [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7333.3s)]
*  If president trump wins [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7338.5s)]
*  Um that people are going to see a very different president trump than they did during the first term [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7340.66s)]
*  Um, I think he's changed as a person [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7345.62s)]
*  Uh, and i've known him for you know, 30 years i've sued him litigated against him [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7348.42s)]
*  And and had a friendship with him even when I was litigating against him [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7353.54s)]
*  And by the way successfully against him [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7358.42s)]
*  but I think he is um [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7361.7s)]
*  He's focused on his legacy. He said many interesting things to me about what he did wrong the last time and about how [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7365.54s)]
*  He filled his you know, he had no idea he was going to win [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7372.02s)]
*  He had no idea how to govern and people descended on him the day that he got elected and said you got to appoint this guy [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7376.18s)]
*  Appoint this guy and he said, you know, I I appointed a lot of people. I shouldn't have pointed. I know who they are now [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7383.06s)]
*  He also said something interesting to me. He said, uh [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7389.620000000001s)]
*  because the democrats one of the big sort of fulcrums of their terror of trump is that [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7393.22s)]
*  He's going to implement this heritage foundation, you know, uh blueprint which is called project 2025 [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7399.7s)]
*  And he brought this issue up to me and he said, you know, they're always telling me i'm i'm for project 2025 [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7407.219999999999s)]
*  I never read project 2025 until they started accusing me of it [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7412.42s)]
*  He said I was written by a right wing ass [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7417.3s)]
*  He said he said there are left wing assholes and there was their right wing assholes and it was a right wing asshole who wrote that [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7422.0199999999995s)]
*  And then he started going through it [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7429.54s)]
*  So I you know, I think there [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7431.54s)]
*  There's a lot and I think he's interested in his legacy now. He wants to leave behind [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7434.0199999999995s)]
*  Some accomplishments and he wants to make our country better [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7441.139999999999s)]
*  and I think he's um, you know, he's listening to a wider range of voices and has [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7445.38s)]
*  He's preparing to govern right now. And you know, i'm going to be on the transition committee [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7451.7s)]
*  picking the people who are going to govern [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7457.7s)]
*  A tulsi is going to be there. There's going to be a wide diversity of of [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7460.339999999999s)]
*  Stakeholders, but he's listening to more than just that kind of narrow right wing band that people are terrified [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7464.48s)]
*  It would be great if you could get to him because you know [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7469.86s)]
*  He really did present well on this podcast and had like a very good moment in that first half of the rnc [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7472.5s)]
*  And then he started defaulting back to and I know a lot of it's like myself hate this about him [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7478.259999999999s)]
*  And it's a big part of why we don't like him is he goes back to incel comics goes back to race goes back to gender [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7483.78s)]
*  You know, and it's just like dude we that trump 1.0 is what people don't want. They don't want chaotic trump. They want, you know [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7490.18s)]
*  post assassination attempt trump and it's just so infuriating [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7498.34s)]
*  Well, a lot of people feel that way jaycon, I think at the end of the day you and others are gonna have to decide [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7503.62s)]
*  Do you want to support the candidate who has the right policies? [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7509.06s)]
*  But maybe there's style points that you don't like about him [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7511.38s)]
*  Because I think that the things you're talking about the mean tweets and so forth at the end of the day [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7515.3s)]
*  I think they're stylistic things. I don't think they go deep to to policy or how he would govern or [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7519.86s)]
*  Do you want to support a campaign? [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7526.74s)]
*  That is running on vibes and joy, you know that has the superficiality that you like [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7529.22s)]
*  But there's nothing underneath it and when we do learn something underneath it when we actually learn a policy [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7535.06s)]
*  Then all the the people who are supporting her have to say oh well, she's not really going to do that [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7540.9s)]
*  She's not going to do that. So the best thing you can say about her campaign [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7546.26s)]
*  Is that she's not going to accomplish the things that she says? [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7550.26s)]
*  She wants to accomplish good. This is on which to vote for a president good news is i'm in texas [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7553.54s)]
*  So i'm I could put in my my bobby kennedy vote as a protest vote and doesn't make a difference and I can [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7558.82s)]
*  Can I respond to the other part of david's question to me? Sure [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7564.34s)]
*  They um, and you know, I think to me the most troubling thing about what's happening now you have you've had two democratic candidates [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7568.34s)]
*  Who've not been able to give unscripted interviews, which is extraordinary. I mean my father [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7576.74s)]
*  And uncle were so proud of you know [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7582.58s)]
*  The united states for our capacity to engage in debate to defend who we were in the world to defend a vision of our country [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7585.06s)]
*  To articulate it to the rest of the world to be the leaders of the free world [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7591.38s)]
*  And um and have a command of the facts and of knowledge and to be eloquent [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7595.78s)]
*  and um [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7601.219999999999s)]
*  How can you be a leader in the world? What does the rest of the world think of us right now? [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7602.74s)]
*  I mean, what could they possibly think we have two democratic party candidates? [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7607.62s)]
*  Who are not able? [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7612.5s)]
*  To explain themselves in an interview and it builds on there said the other day something [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7614.5s)]
*  Yeah, really I think point in which is if you want it if you want the job of handling the nuclear code [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7620.900000000001s)]
*  You got to do an interview first [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7627.860000000001s)]
*  And you know, how can you go? [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7629.860000000001s)]
*  39 days [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7632.8s)]
*  without talking to the press [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7634.5s)]
*  without being able to defend your record to explain who you are to the american people and if you talk to democrats about this [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7636.74s)]
*  And you can get past the anger and pass the vitriol on this kind of wall of of tribal [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReB5UHfKCG8&t=7645.3s)]
