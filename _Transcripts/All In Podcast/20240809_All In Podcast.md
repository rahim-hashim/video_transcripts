*  Guys know this one, right? This is the hundred meter virtue signal. So you see there [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=175.92s)]
*  Edge me out and I'm right ahead of Paul Graham. So we [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=182.76s)]
*  Signaling [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=187.28s)]
*  100 meter dash it was pretty great. It's pretty grand [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=188.88s)]
*  But congrats to Reid Hoffman also coming on the pod to debate you sex hard to beat them in virtue signaling [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=191.48s)]
*  I know I felt like I felt like sober in this case [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=196.44s)]
*  Was a goal, you know, given the competition, right? You just if you meddle in that group of virtue signals [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=200.64s)]
*  All right, everybody welcome back to the all-in podcast of course the number one podcast in the world and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=216.48s)]
*  I'm back daddy's home and we've got a very full docket [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=224.6s)]
*  Sax will get his red meat at the end for all the magaluna ticks in the comments. Don't worry [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=228.0s)]
*  He's gonna get his red meat, but we got bigger fish to fry in the markets [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=232.64s)]
*  Markets were down big on Monday due to something called the yen carry [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=236.12s)]
*  Trade the Dow was down 700 points that it was down like 6% [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=240.16s)]
*  It was unsettling social media went crazy on Sunday night that it was gonna be the end of the world the beginning of a recession [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  Maybe a depression and this all happened because Japan Central Bank raised their interest rates by a whopping 15 to 25 basis points [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  And we'll explain why that's important in just a moment with the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=260.24s)]
*  I'll get you off to give us a little overview here of the yen carry trade [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=266.34s)]
*  But this is a big deal because Japan has had its interest rates at near zero even negative since 1999 [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=269.46s)]
*  So this little blip on the chart is [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=275.38s)]
*  You know the interest rate going up [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=278.94s)]
*  You know there in Japan so quick explainer and then trim off will have you go deeper [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=280.94s)]
*  The end carry trade is a pretty [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=286.5s)]
*  Basic concept investors borrow at zero percent interest or close to it [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=288.82s)]
*  Basic concept investors borrow at zero percent interest or close to it due to this zero percent interest rate [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=292.66s)]
*  And then you convert your yen into another currency or perhaps a stock like Nvidia and you take the spread so [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=298.38s)]
*  You know the goal is obviously to return a higher rate than the cost of borrowing the yen [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=306.58s)]
*  And so here's an example of it if you just want to look at the flow you borrow some yen at zero percent you invest [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=311.78000000000003s)]
*  It in stocks whatever [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=317.5s)]
*  You get some appreciation and then you liquidate the stocks and you pay back your bill, of course this can all go hardly [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=319.46s)]
*  Yeah, but a safer way to do this is just to invest in a US T bill. That's paying 5% [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=325.7s)]
*  Yeah [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=332.7s)]
*  Yeah, so you have you borrow it you borrow yen at zero percent invest in T bills at 5% and you pocket the difference [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=334.7s)]
*  Yeah, you just have to pay back the loan. Of course to mop this can all go very wrong if a number of things happen [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=341.38s)]
*  So maybe you could give us an overview of this kind of trade. Have you ever done something like this? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=348.08s)]
*  What do you think of these type of trades these? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=353.47999999999996s)]
*  What unquote free money trades, you know picking up free money off the ground? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=356.47999999999996s)]
*  trades I [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=360.76s)]
*  mean, I think these kinds of so I've never done them and part of the reason why is I think these things [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=362.56s)]
*  Look genius and they work until one [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=370.03999999999996s)]
*  Moment in time where they stop working and it stops working so severely that it becomes almost impossible to unwind yourself [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=373.68s)]
*  And so you can get on one thing. Yeah [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=380.2s)]
*  Yeah, so I think typically in these situations the thing you have to remember is you don't really make a lot of money [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=383.52000000000004s)]
*  In this trade the way you make a lot of money is by leveraging this trade up [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=389.72s)]
*  So meaning it's not like borrowing a million [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=394.92s)]
*  Dollars in yen and then swapping it to US dollars and then putting it in t-bills is a real moneymaker [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=398.52s)]
*  You're talking about 50k. That's not really gonna move the needle [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=404.36s)]
*  so what people try to do in these situations is [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=408.02s)]
*  Do it on a billion dollars and then lever it up five or ten X [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=412.36s)]
*  the problem with that is that you're posting all kinds of collateral as [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=416.88s)]
*  Margin to these banks to give you that leverage because then all of a sudden [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=422.2s)]
*  Capturing a hundred and fifty basis points on ten billion or fifteen billion. Now we're talking about real money [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  and so when these things go wrong and they happen very suddenly [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=434.4s)]
*  what it does is it puts pressure on all other asset classes because people are scrambling to make sure that they don't get margined out and [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=440.12s)]
*  What you saw over the weekend was it mostly a lot of that happening? Which was a lot of these folks [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=449.12s)]
*  Were putting this trade on to the tune of tens or probably even a hundred billion plus dollars Wow [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=456.56s)]
*  of which they had maybe five or ten billion of equity and [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=464.04s)]
*  eighty to ninety billion dollars of just margin and [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=467.96s)]
*  That's what caused this very quick cycle. Hmm [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=472.2s)]
*  Then it looked like it unraveled itself. And so people thought oh, we're probably mostly passes. I actually think we're not I've said this before [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=477.24s)]
*  I [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=484.94s)]
*  Think one of the most interesting things I've learned in the last few years about the stock market is the stock market is owned [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=486.17999999999995s)]
*  By and large by these algos, right meaning there's these large [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=494.7s)]
*  Kind of murky grayish hedge funds that have these computer trading algorithms [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=499.9s)]
*  That are allowed to be levered to the tune of you know, 13 15 20 times [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=505.46s)]
*  About 50 billion dollars. So these folks are swinging around a trillion dollars each. Okay, and [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=512.98s)]
*  we all just live in their world because when these algorithms make a decision and [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=520.02s)]
*  They react to these kinds of events. That's when the real volatility starts [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=525.74s)]
*  So I think the most important thing was summarized by friends of ours [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=531.1s)]
*  From Goldman Sachs [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=536.86s)]
*  I just want to Nick if you want to just throw the picture that they sent me so they sent [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=537.9s)]
*  they sent some really good market insights whenever these things kind of happened to a bunch of their clients and [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=542.34s)]
*  One of the interesting things that they observed is a couple of facts [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=548.1800000000001s)]
*  The first is the algorithms in the middle of all of this chaos sold about 41 billion dollars of global equities [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=553.3000000000001s)]
*  Okay, no big deal [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=559.9s)]
*  Except that it actually causes everybody else to have to react and then they sell billions and billions more [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=561.34s)]
*  The other thing that they noticed though is that there we're in a moment in time where you can see [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=568.46s)]
*  how these algorithms will behave over the next month and [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=574.78s)]
*  Right now if there's relatively minimal volatility and not much changes [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=578.5s)]
*  The algorithms will have to sell another hundred and sixty odd billion dollars of equity and [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=585.38s)]
*  That'll pull through many hundred billions more from everybody else [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=591.54s)]
*  So I think we're in a little bit of a delicate moment where [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=595.26s)]
*  the preponderance of the market action will be to continue to sell and [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=599.78s)]
*  I think it's just going to be when we look back in hindsight another reason why getting levered on these things is very dangerous [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=604.5400000000001s)]
*  There's no free money basically. Yeah, there is no free money in this free money trade and just to [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=610.86s)]
*  Translate a little bit of this on the margins for the audience. Who's not familiar with it [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=615.94s)]
*  Margin is alone fancy way of saying alone margin call [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=620.0600000000001s)]
*  You have some asset that backs it up, you know in your case it might be, you know a civilian [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=623.66s)]
*  It might be your house whatever your bank account in these cases these big companies [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=628.5s)]
*  These hedge funds might have cash or equities and if they come down and they have to pay the loan [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=633.14s)]
*  They are forced to liquidate it and in some cases [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=639.8599999999999s)]
*  Those assets are controlled by the person giving the loan and they will just start [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=642.9399999999999s)]
*  Programmatically selling your shares and whatever Apple Google whatever in video you want to pay down that margin [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=648.5s)]
*  and this is called a margin call bus the name of the [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=654.68s)]
*  Movie and so it's incredibly dangerous and the leverage is you and I can or like any civilian could borrow [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=658.5799999999999s)]
*  You know five hundred thousand dollars against their two million dollar house and home equity [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=664.54s)]
*  Rich people and these big banks they can borrow ten or twenty times the value of the assets [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=668.6999999999999s)]
*  Which then could lead to absolute chaos Freberg [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=674.8399999999999s)]
*  Let's go to you next and just talk a little bit about what's going on in Japan because [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=678.2399999999999s)]
*  They have had a rush to people buying their stocks the population declining. It's a very [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=683.8s)]
*  unique [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=690.68s)]
*  Economy, maybe you could talk a little bit about it [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=692.3199999999999s)]
*  one of the biggest challenges facing Japan is the level of debt that they've accrued their debt to GDP ratios currently [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=694.4799999999999s)]
*  263 percent they have about [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=702.16s)]
*  1.3 quadrillion yen of public debt on [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=704.4399999999999s)]
*  An annual GDP of about 591 trillion yen [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=709.1999999999999s)]
*  They're currently at the federal level [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=713.9599999999999s)]
*  Spending about 20% of GDP per year [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=716.8s)]
*  5% of GDP is being spent per year [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=720.16s)]
*  Just on servicing the existing debt and that's at interest rates set by the central bank of roughly 0% [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=724.0s)]
*  So, you know or whatever the market is trading at that so slightly above 0% [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=732.12s)]
*  But if the central bank had to start to raise rates because inflation started to run away because there's so much [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=736.0400000000001s)]
*  Yen in circulation there's so much debt outstanding the federal government would not be able to actually service this debt [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=742.7600000000001s)]
*  so as of March of 2024 the Bank of Japan the central bank actually holds 53 percent of [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=749.0400000000001s)]
*  Japan's outstanding government bonds [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=755.8800000000001s)]
*  Which is equal to about a hundred percent of Japan's GDP so their central bank has bought the debt [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=758.28s)]
*  That's being issued by the federal government to fund their budget a large chunk of which right now is being spent just on paying [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=764.96s)]
*  The interest on the debt while interest rates are close to zero percent [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=772.0s)]
*  So imagine if interest rates bumped up to one two three four five percent as we're seeing with US treasuries [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=775.56s)]
*  We were recently at a nearly five percent handle on the on the ten-year Treasury [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=781.48s)]
*  It would become an unsustainable debt burden for the Japanese government to be able to handle that and a large part of this is [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=786.0400000000001s)]
*  being driven by a number of crises that [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=792.12s)]
*  Japan has faced since the early 90s. So there was the financial crisis in a way. There was the nuclear [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=795.8000000000001s)]
*  Meltdown there was a couple of earthquakes tsunamis and a lot of debt has been taken on to support [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=802.44s)]
*  The country after those crises but really importantly and Nick if you could just pull up this age chart is [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=807.8000000000001s)]
*  The aging of the Japanese population [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=813.92s)]
*  So this chart shows that and you can kind of see back to 1950 when the average age in Japan was 21 years old [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=816.44s)]
*  And today the average age in Japan is around 48, you know in the next decade [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=822.52s)]
*  It'll be 50 then it'll be 52. So that means more and more people are relying on public pension today [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=827.32s)]
*  33% of their government spending goes towards their social security programs in the US for comparison [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=835.2s)]
*  Social Security is about 20% of federal spending [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=841.62s)]
*  So that number is only getting bigger and bigger as the population ages [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=843.5400000000001s)]
*  The Japanese government has to continue to service their older population and they've had to face several crises [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=847.12s)]
*  Their debt has ballooned to a level that is well beyond any other industrialized nation and the only way to continue to service that debt [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=853.22s)]
*  Economically is to keep interest rates low and the problem with keeping interest rate low [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=860.26s)]
*  Inflation and that's the big driver that caused them to say let's uptake the interest by 15 bits or 25 bits [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=864.9000000000001s)]
*  Is to try and tackle the inflation problem. They're facing just like our central bank recently tried to do the same [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=871.0999999999999s)]
*  But clearly the market can't have it [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=876.9s)]
*  So Japan is in a real pickle and I think that it shows how much [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=879.14s)]
*  Having a large amount of federal debt can impact the ability for a nation to maneuver itself during difficult times and ultimately [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=883.26s)]
*  debt payments come due they come to you either in the form of economic contraction or [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=891.26s)]
*  Massive taxes or inflation and currently Japan is paying for it in terms of inflation [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=898.14s)]
*  Sorry, you're saying Japan has inflation Japan is no inflation. The government raised rates to tackle inflation [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=903.22s)]
*  I'll pull up the inflation chart Japan's inflation hit a 40 year high and this just shot up in the last 18 months [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=909.6600000000001s)]
*  Inflation is running at close to 4% a year. And so they're setting Friedberg [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=917.1800000000001s)]
*  the interest rate in the country and they own the debt so [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=923.3000000000001s)]
*  They are basically in control of or they are manipulating the economy and trying to control it. Correct Friedberg [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=927.34s)]
*  Well, their central bank has to buy most of the debt and their central bank sets the rates [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=934.3000000000001s)]
*  So they have a large amount 50 or 53 percent of their federal of their public debt [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=939.14s)]
*  It's held by their central bank [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=943.5s)]
*  And if they don't pay a high interest rate then people don't buy future bonds if they do raise it [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=944.82s)]
*  They have to pay that rate. So this is the conundrum Friedberg if I were to summarize it [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=950.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, well rates are low you see this, you know, particularly in a market like we're facing today where there's global inflation [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=954.62s)]
*  They need to raise rates in order to reduce inflation. The problem with raising rates is this this you know, this currency problem [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=962.3s)]
*  But also buying the debt Chamath is you know, who's buying debt if you're not getting anything on the coupon, correct? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=969.14s)]
*  That's another challenge they face in Japan is that [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=975.34s)]
*  There's a famous quote from an economist Simon Kuznets who said there's four kinds of countries in the world [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=978.34s)]
*  There's developed countries undeveloped countries Japan and Argentina [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=983.18s)]
*  And I think the reason he said that is that [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=988.26s)]
*  Japan has been in the state since the 90s [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=992.4599999999999s)]
*  So they had a massive property and equity bubble collapse and they've not had to deal [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=994.66s)]
*  With anything that looked like typical economic issues since then and part of it is because [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1000.66s)]
*  The government plays a very big hand in the Japanese economy. There's a lot of price controls there. So, I don't know [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1005.78s)]
*  I'm not sure what it is that we can learn there that you can extrapolate to the rest of the world [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1011.38s)]
*  Yeah, it is a very unique sax [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1017.6600000000001s)]
*  Geography and economy so sax your thoughts on this overall and what we can expect [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1020.26s)]
*  Maybe you could take the future looking forward looking and prediction crystal ball good [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1024.46s)]
*  So I think free burgers right that the reason why the Japanese Central Bank tried to raise rates [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1029.5s)]
*  I mean despite a tiny amount was because they are dealing with inflation if you look at that inflation chart and you go back [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1034.54s)]
*  To when their inflation was zero roughly in 2020 the exchange ratio between the US dollar and the yen [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1040.1s)]
*  Was about a hundred to one meaning one US dollar could buy a hundred yen now [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1048.1399999999999s)]
*  It's at roughly 150 yen to the dollar [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1051.98s)]
*  So their currency has massively depreciated over the last several years and a big part of the reason why is because again their [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1054.74s)]
*  Central Bank is offering roughly zero and you can earn five percent in [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1062.82s)]
*  US T bills so people are basically [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1067.22s)]
*  Moving their money to countries that pay a lot more on their bonds and they're even borrowing yen like we talked about [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1071.3400000000001s)]
*  Selling the yen to then buy Australian dollars US dollars to invest money there so there's huge downward pressure on the value of the yen [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1079.1000000000001s)]
*  And the way this creates inflation is that [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1088.42s)]
*  Japan is a is obviously an island that has very few natural resources and it has to import all of its oil [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1091.98s)]
*  so it has an advanced economy, but it needs to import a lot of resources and [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1099.46s)]
*  so as its currency depreciates the price of all those commodities goes up and [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1103.78s)]
*  This is why you're seeing inflation in Japan [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1108.74s)]
*  Now when the central bank tried to solve this it created huge jitters in the financial market because it was starting to unwind the whole [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1111.22s)]
*  Yen carry trade which is something like [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1117.98s)]
*  $20 trillion and so the the Bank of Japan backed off and you heard the the Japanese central banker said we can't raise rates [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1120.82s)]
*  While it would create instability in the global markets [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1128.62s)]
*  We have to wait until it's stable [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1131.8999999999999s)]
*  But the problem is that raising the rates and unwinding the yen carry trade creates the instability [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1134.26s)]
*  So what they're saying is we're never gonna be able to raise rates and the result of this is going to be more [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1140.02s)]
*  Inflation in Japan their currency is going to continue to depreciate [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1145.46s)]
*  You know, they've been unable to defend it [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1149.82s)]
*  and so what I would expect is that the US dollar is gonna keep buying more yen is gonna go from I don't know [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1152.1s)]
*  14750 there is one some bigger some bigger number [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1160.58s)]
*  It's one huge upside to this sax and who's gonna pay the price here is the Japanese consumer [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1163.1s)]
*  Because everything is gonna cost a lot more [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1168.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and that was you know, obviously when when you get a hundred and fifty [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1170.74s)]
*  8 yen to the dollar. This is extraordinary [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1175.78s)]
*  I was talking with Tucker and we just took our Niseko ski trip this year from four days to seven because it is just such [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1178.22s)]
*  a great deal so [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1184.58s)]
*  It'll be good for tourism because yeah, you'll be able to travel to Japan much more cheap [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1186.34s)]
*  But if you're if you're actually Japanese and you live in that country, you're gonna see your purchasing power continue to erode [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1190.3799999999999s)]
*  So I would expect big domestic problems in Japan and eventually they may conclude that this system does not benefit them [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1196.22s)]
*  Now who does it benefit you could argue that it benefits the United States because it has [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1203.9s)]
*  subsidized [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1209.5s)]
*  the purchase of our debt [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1211.1000000000001s)]
*  right because again [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1213.7s)]
*  So so you have this yen carry trade of 20 trillion and a lot of that has gone into US bonds or US T bills [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1214.7800000000002s)]
*  right, and so it basically is a huge subsidy to [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1221.74s)]
*  the US Treasury's [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1226.5800000000002s)]
*  Need to continuously issue more and more debt we're issuing what a trillion dollars of net new debt every 100 days [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1228.9399999999998s)]
*  So having the Japanese consumer subsidize all of this by taking it on the chin [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1235.74s)]
*  You know in terms of inflation in order to provide this yen carry trade you could argue has been very beneficial [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1241.6999999999998s)]
*  to the US Treasury and Chamath at some point the you know, the percentage of [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1246.6599999999999s)]
*  Your debt to GDP, you know, we've talked about it so much on this show [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1253.6999999999998s)]
*  You've said previously hey, you know, we can have a little bit of this because we're a very strong dollar [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1258.02s)]
*  So when you look at Japan, is there some lesson here for the US or you know, maybe some [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1262.62s)]
*  Warning here that we we shouldn't necessarily follow them too far down this road [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1268.78s)]
*  nope [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1273.62s)]
*  Okay, keep printing money got it, okay [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1275.78s)]
*  I don't know [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1277.78s)]
*  I mean I tend to agree with Freeberg here that when you have massive amounts of debt it definitely limits your flexibility [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1278.18s)]
*  Take you're gonna pay for it with either economic contraction higher taxes or inflation. Those are the three places it goes [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1285.74s)]
*  Yeah, and they and they did test it. They've stressed out now. Yeah, one of the reasons why [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1291.98s)]
*  Japan can't raise rates is because [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1297.5s)]
*  Their debt will become even more expensive [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1300.58s)]
*  Right. I mean free burgers in that part of the problem [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1303.42s)]
*  Yeah [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1306.26s)]
*  That's exactly right. And then their federal spending gets compressed because now they have to service that debt again [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1307.54s)]
*  They're already spending 25% of their federal budget on servicing existing debt with the low interest rates and they've got to support an aging population [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1313.26s)]
*  Okay, so so to analogize this the US with our our debt service cost or what? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1321.1s)]
*  What are they at now like well over a trillion? We're about a trillion a year with a proposed seven point three trillion budget [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1325.5s)]
*  so we're at thirteen point six percent and [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1331.22s)]
*  Japan also [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1334.3s)]
*  Over the next ten years isn't our debt service supposed to rise to yeah as all of the as all of the low interest bonds [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1335.94s)]
*  Mature and we issue new debt at a higher interest rate our debt service cost is going to continue to climb [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1343.1000000000001s)]
*  It's already higher than discretionary military spending it over a trillion a year [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1349.02s)]
*  Well just buy Bitcoin and when it goes to a million dollars a coin, we can just pay it all down [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1352.9s)]
*  So problem solved just one other point is I think it shows [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1356.74s)]
*  the fragility of the global financial system, I mean [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1360.74s)]
*  The markets snap back as soon as the Bank of Japan backed off basically capitulated said, okay fine. We can't [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1365.02s)]
*  We can't defend our currency. We're just gonna let it keep depreciating [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1371.62s)]
*  We're gonna let inflation keep raging as soon as they declared that then the market snapped back [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1375.06s)]
*  But it just showed in that 24 hours putting aside like all the panic porn that was on social media [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1379.5s)]
*  I think that was overdone [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1384.6599999999999s)]
*  It still showed how fragile the global economy is the the yen carry trade has injected roughly 20 trillion dollars of liquidity [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1386.34s)]
*  into the global economy and that is [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1394.58s)]
*  Propping up all sorts of things right and that is subsidizing US government debt and you just wonder if [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1397.06s)]
*  The yen carry trade were to end because let's say for example, the Japanese people don't want to experience hyperinflation [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1403.8999999999999s)]
*  Then what would that do to the global economy? It just showed how rickety the whole system is [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1412.1s)]
*  I think it shows how much leverage there isn't this is totally that's what it is. It's all about leverage [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1416.4199999999998s)]
*  Okay, let's talk about leverage for a section Chema leverage on leverage on leverage [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1421.34s)]
*  So for example, like if you take something like Citadel runs about 50 billion dollars and they have [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1425.96s)]
*  Extremely precise risk management systems. They're the best in the business [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1433.72s)]
*  But as a result of that they are so systematically important to make the financial machinery run properly [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1438.92s)]
*  That as they're inspected and as they prove that they have very good risk management [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1445.54s)]
*  They're allowed to lever up to incredible levels, you know 15 16 17 times [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1449.92s)]
*  So I think that Citadel with the 50 billion of capital that investors have given them is probably running a trillion dollars on a daily [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1455.68s)]
*  basis in the markets [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1463.76s)]
*  Renaissance technologies same situation [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1465.5800000000002s)]
*  Millennium same situation a bunch of these funds that sit inside of the large banks same situation [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1469.1200000000001s)]
*  So when you add it all up, you're probably talking about a few hundred billion dollars of notional capital [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1475.56s)]
*  That's enormously levered. That's what causes the [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1482.84s)]
*  That sensation as sack said that things are ready. So should we have more increased regulation or increased scrutiny on this Chema? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1487.1599999999999s)]
*  You've talked about it before when we had some of these hedge funds flip and we talked about maybe some regulation [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1493.24s)]
*  You know, we have a lot of regulation on banks [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1498.54s)]
*  Essentially what happened is after all of the chaos of the great financial crisis the thing that we don't talk about is [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1501.7800000000002s)]
*  What we really did was keep running the same if not more risk. We just took it off balance sheet [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1508.38s)]
*  So the banks were able to structure business lines to work with these hedge funds and these hedge funds in turn [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1513.9s)]
*  Were able to show over time that they're so tightly managed that there are no black swan events that could happen [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1521.66s)]
*  That they can run highly levered so I think we are in this moment where [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1528.6200000000001s)]
*  There'll be these fissures from time to time [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1536.94s)]
*  So here's this bill Huang. That's an example. The carry trade is another example [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1539.42s)]
*  There have been examples a couple times a year, but at some point [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1545.26s)]
*  These folks will have taken too much risk and we'll look back on it and we'll think that [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1550.06s)]
*  Hedge funds should probably have been more regulated than they are with respect to their [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1555.66s)]
*  Leverage ratios not with respect to their strategies with this particular trade JP Morgan yesterday or a few hours ago said that they think about [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1560.46s)]
*  75% of the yen carry trades have now been unwound and it was at 50% a little over a day ago [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1569.7s)]
*  So the market has moved to kind of unwind these trades it seems and we're pretty much at the end of [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1575.26s)]
*  The levered fallout of [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1582.22s)]
*  This particular activity so I put the link and so people at home understand [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1585.5s)]
*  Well, we move on to the to the to the next phase of the financial markets [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1590.18s)]
*  All of those people had to cover those trades [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1594.62s)]
*  Which means they all have to sell assets at the same time as buying yen or covering the end and that's what causes this acute [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1596.66s)]
*  Chaos in the markets we saw the NASDAQ go down 6% or in some cases [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1602.9s)]
*  Maybe people want to take some chips off the table since things [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1606.46s)]
*  Put that trade back on in fact now [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1610.34s)]
*  I mean better time to put that trade on because a Bank of Japan's basically just capitulated and said [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1612.78s)]
*  That they can't raise interest rates while things are so unstable [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1617.6999999999998s)]
*  So we know they're just gonna keep rates where they are. So if I was one of these traders as I trade back on now [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1621.4599999999998s)]
*  So, let's talk about the landing here in the US [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1630.06s)]
*  Let's get you eccentric now and it looks like maybe it's gonna be a bumpy landing rather than a soft [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1632.3s)]
*  Landing as one might suspect and as we talked about here that we think this could be bumpy to soft [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1637.82s)]
*  July's job reports was pretty bad, which is good in some ways when you're thinking about inflation [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1643.6599999999999s)]
*  So the new jobs added were way down [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1650.82s)]
*  growing a hundred fourteen thousand here in July and [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1653.58s)]
*  A bunch of these estimates have been reported downward over the past year [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1656.9399999999998s)]
*  Just so we make a note of that and this was below the Dow Jones estimate of a hundred eighty five thousand [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1660.9799999999998s)]
*  There's your chart. It just keeps ticking down [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1666.94s)]
*  You know since the Fed started hiking rates and you hear anecdotally about all of your friends [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1670.54s)]
*  88% of Millennials right now are actually preparing to be laid off [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1676.8200000000002s)]
*  According to a recent survey unemployment is way up [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1680.6200000000001s)]
*  In the short term here. We're at four point three percent in July. That's the highest since October of 2021 up from four point one percent [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1685.74s)]
*  Last month and three point five percent in July. So you take that July number to now it's pretty significant [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1694.1200000000001s)]
*  Here's your chart on the jobs. Obviously historically it's low, but it's ticking up pretty quickly [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1699.1200000000001s)]
*  Which is what you would expect with the rate hikes and we had this great moment of hourly earnings growth going up [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1705.0800000000002s)]
*  So how much people make on average? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1712.5600000000002s)]
*  Per hour was going up and I think that was causing a decent amount of the consumer enthusiasm in the economy [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1714.52s)]
*  Here it is. It's coming way down from almost six percent down to three and a half [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1721.36s)]
*  And so that means Fed rate cuts are coming [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1726.28s)]
*  Here's your chart from a prediction market of the chances of how much the Fed [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1730.92s)]
*  Cuts rates this year looks like 75 to 100 basis points is the majority [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1737.92s)]
*  About 60% of people believe will be one of those two numbers. I'll stop there [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1743.36s)]
*  There's a lot more to talk about here and we'll get into specific companies and the Nasdaq [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1748.1399999999999s)]
*  Let me pull up this last chart before I go to you Chamath [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1752.3s)]
*  It's been a strong year for the market S&P and Nasdaq both up 11% year-to-date as of Thursday morning [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1754.4199999999998s)]
*  but obviously a massive I [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1761.26s)]
*  Guess do we call it a correction when it's yeah 20% is correction territory Chamath. So [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1763.4199999999998s)]
*  Your thoughts on the wider US market and the sell-off. I think we're in a low-key recession [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1769.4599999999998s)]
*  So I think that we're gonna probably go through a couple of very [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1775.22s)]
*  Difficult revisions of old data the thing to remember about non-farm payrolls isn't as much what the number is [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1780.14s)]
*  But if you actually look to the number of times it then gets revised [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1787.98s)]
*  The reality is that these things get revised constantly and right now we're in this trend where we are overestimating and revising down [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1791.82s)]
*  Saxe mentioned this that that was the same with GDP [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1799.98s)]
*  So we are I think in a tough situation and then what you're seeing is folks that run [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1803.14s)]
*  Very cyclical businesses are telling us in very plain-spoken English that demand isn't there [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1810.42s)]
*  So the one that was interesting this past week Jason you mentioned Millennials [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1817.14s)]
*  But like Airbnb where you think all these young people are running around [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1821.78s)]
*  Yoloing what whatever cash they have [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1826.34s)]
*  Airbnb had a massive warning on demand [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1829.9s)]
*  So when I think the excess capital whether it's the steamy check or what-have-you has been exhausted [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1832.02s)]
*  You're now starting to see it bear out in these [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1839.02s)]
*  Cyclical businesses. I don't think the demand is there. I think we're in a recession [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1842.26s)]
*  it probably becomes more obvious in q3 and q4 and [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1848.6200000000001s)]
*  So Powell's going to have to cut the question is will he overreact to the pressure? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1853.46s)]
*  and cut 75 to 100 versus [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1859.02s)]
*  25 and take it slow [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1863.22s)]
*  Okay, Freiburg technical definition of a recession is two quarters in a row of negative GDP [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1865.06s)]
*  We haven't had that but we're sort of bouncing along that possibility is the recession [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1870.1s)]
*  baked in or if they cut rates at the extent the [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1876.7s)]
*  Prediction markets are predicting and they're signaling. Do you think we have a nice rebound? How do you feel about the overall US economy? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1880.54s)]
*  Obviously you have to account for [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1888.46s)]
*  Inflation and government spending how much of government spending is driving economic growth [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1890.66s)]
*  Today the US is proposing to spend [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1897.54s)]
*  seven point three trillion dollars next year out of 25 trillion dollar GDP [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1901.38s)]
*  so the US federal government is roughly 30% of GDP and [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1907.82s)]
*  We obviously still are tackling inflation [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1913.18s)]
*  The real question is how much of the economy is growing? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1916.78s)]
*  because of productivity gains in the [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1922.3000000000002s)]
*  Sector of the economy where people are making things and doing things [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1925.9s)]
*  Versus the government using its ability to tax and borrow [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1929.6200000000001s)]
*  To drive growth in the economy by inflating numbers by pushing revenue onto businesses by pushing capital into the markets by creating [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1933.78s)]
*  levered trades in the markets [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1941.94s)]
*  using their [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1944.3000000000002s)]
*  Borrowing capacity and their taxing capacity. So that's the thing I remain concerned about I I mentioned this last week. I remain highly [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1945.5s)]
*  Concerned about many sectors of the economy that are deeply challenged right now [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1952.22s)]
*  particularly the industrial sectors manufacturing sectors the agricultural sectors [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1957.26s)]
*  But services and software sectors where you can raise prices and you have a nice high margin business [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1961.7s)]
*  You can continue to to grow and and look good [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1966.78s)]
*  But there are many parts of the the global economy and the US economy that are pretty challenged right now [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1970.38s)]
*  Sax let's talk about [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1975.98s)]
*  this soft to bumpy landing [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1977.86s)]
*  Consumers are definitely weakening on the low end Airbnb and Amazon are example of bargain hunting people who are looking for discounts who want to [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1981.02s)]
*  save money with those services higher end services that have a bigger price tag like uber and some of the [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1988.34s)]
*  High-end retailers are showing actual growth and they're saying that consumer strong. So it was a tale of two cities [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=1995.02s)]
*  During this earning season with a bunch of the high-end folks saying strong consumers on the high end weak consumers on the low end [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2001.4199999999998s)]
*  What are the chances we go into a recession and you know a second question for you? [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2008.3799999999999s)]
*  Elon was recently on Lex Freeman for I think eight days or something [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2014.34s)]
*  it was like a record podcast of how long he was on but one of the things he talked about was that he had discussed with [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2018.32s)]
*  Trump and [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2023.1999999999998s)]
*  Vivek has been very strong about this on our podcast in other places and he was a leading VP candidate of [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2024.5s)]
*  making the government more efficient and radically cutting the amount of spending but [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2030.6200000000001s)]
*  There would be a reaction. So does the potential GOP administration have a platform to cut costs massively or not? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2035.0600000000002s)]
*  And do you think that you know that would have been maybe? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2042.5600000000002s)]
*  Too unpopular to sort of unveil that plan now as a as a presidential candidate in either party [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2046.3400000000001s)]
*  I don't think they have that plan specifically because I just think that you would need [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2052.2200000000003s)]
*  You would need a supermajority in Congress to do something like that [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2056.7799999999997s)]
*  And I just think that this elections can be too close regardless of who wins to provide that kind of mandate [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2059.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean sadly, I think we do need to get a government spending under control [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2065.08s)]
*  But I think it's a long-term political problem and I just think our political system doesn't have the will to fix it [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2068.42s)]
*  I do believe Republicans would be better than Democrats on that [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2073.7799999999997s)]
*  But I think that's the truth of it to go back to your first question on the state of the economy [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2076.46s)]
*  I had lunch with a [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2081.5s)]
*  Very prominent investor yesterday who's very plugged in with the hedge fund community and he said that the sentiment shift [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2083.94s)]
*  You know, I'd say again within hedge funds professional investors public market investors [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2091.78s)]
*  had been very sudden that people were now very worried about the risk of a recession and [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2096.74s)]
*  And I do think that the Airbnb revenue that Chima cited is a big factor [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2103.78s)]
*  Airbnb stock went down 15% in [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2109.06s)]
*  One day on soft demand and what's driving all this is is consumer weakness or at least fear of consumer weakness [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2111.8599999999997s)]
*  You mentioned the rise in unemployment. It went from 4.1 to 4.3 percent [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2118.9s)]
*  Month over month. So 4.3 is still a pretty low number by historical terms, but to jump so much in one month [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2124.46s)]
*  That's a pretty big increase. And then of course, it's up from 3.5 percent a year ago [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2131.8199999999997s)]
*  So we're seeing pretty big increases in [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2137.42s)]
*  Year-over-year 5% month-over-month is very significant. Yeah. So these are big changes [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2141.38s)]
*  there's real evidence of consumer weakness and I think professional investors are getting quite worried about [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2146.1200000000003s)]
*  the risk of a recession and I guess this one last point on this is that if you were to [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2153.02s)]
*  Remove the impact of government spending. It's pretty clear. The private sector is in a recession [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2159.78s)]
*  I mean like we've been talking about [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2164.58s)]
*  Governments been going hog wild with spending. We have the government is running 6% of GDP [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2166.94s)]
*  deficits [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2172.2999999999997s)]
*  The the latest q2 growth number was something like 2% [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2173.54s)]
*  so if you force government to live within its means and [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2176.94s)]
*  To cut its way back to balance. We would definitely be in a recession. We'd have a negative growth rate [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2179.9s)]
*  So I do think that the economy is looking pretty shaky all of a sudden [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2185.62s)]
*  Whether we actually tip over into recession in the next few months. I'm not sure [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2190.34s)]
*  All right. Well, listen, I want to corner everybody here with a question [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2193.74s)]
*  You got to answer the question you you can't avoid the hard questions here on the all-in podcast [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2196.5s)]
*  Chamath sitting here a year from now mark it up or we experience a recession defined as two [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2201.42s)]
*  Quarters of negative GDP, which one is the more likely scenario mark it up or a recession? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2207.9s)]
*  Give it a percentage or just which is more likely [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2214.42s)]
*  Free burger neck. Well, those are not those are [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2217.2599999999998s)]
*  Those are not opposing things so you're saying a year from now, I don't I don't honestly know [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2219.98s)]
*  Okay, but I do think that we'll probably be in a technical recession [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2225.54s)]
*  Okay, so you lean towards I'll just go recession no recession in the next year [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2230.6200000000003s)]
*  But I also think that there's a pretty decent chance the market will be up. Ah [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2234.82s)]
*  Got it. Okay, so we could have a recession but the market goes up [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2239.54s)]
*  So to unpack that I am with you on that same prediction because I do think people are [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2242.1000000000004s)]
*  Addicted to efficiency they're gonna lay people off and earnings are gonna keep ripping as these companies become managed so well [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2247.1s)]
*  That's a small percentage of the economy Jake how that's a few tech companies [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2253.2599999999998s)]
*  But much of the manufacturing sector the industrial sector the ag markets like there's a lot of markets where you don't have this option [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2257.14s)]
*  To just cut knowledge workers the knowledge worker economy [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2263.2599999999998s)]
*  The software economy has the ability to do that the tech economy can do that [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2266.2599999999998s)]
*  But much of the rest of the economy doesn't have a lot of maneuverability like we do in this in this fast well [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2270.02s)]
*  High margin kind of industry we work in I think it's a good point [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2276.3s)]
*  But I do see McDonald's Starbucks and some of those consumer retailers are [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2279.34s)]
*  Taking steps right now to right size their businesses and offer five dollar meals or three dollar coffee. So I do think there's a [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2284.2200000000003s)]
*  Shift in management and how they run these companies that's about reduced forecast, right? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2291.7000000000003s)]
*  So when their revenue decline when their revenue forecasts have to be cut they have to cut headcount [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2295.7400000000002s)]
*  That's different than creating more efficiency. Well, but they're also cutting stores and they're [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2300.3s)]
*  Things and yeah, yeah projects that are inefficient. So I just think there's gonna be massive efficiency in all sectors [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2304.66s)]
*  That's gonna be the theme for the next year [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2310.02s)]
*  But I mean it's obviously that's that's a lot of jobs and a loss of growth, right? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2311.22s)]
*  So just to be clear when you cut stores you have less growth when you cut jobs [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2314.78s)]
*  That's because you don't have as much revenue growth. So those are about earnings can go up, right? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2318.02s)]
*  They can be supported but you're still facing contraction and you know, one of the challenges right now [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2323.18s)]
*  A lot of food companies a lot of retail companies have been raising prices to try and keep earnings going up [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2328.14s)]
*  But there's hitting this natural inflection point where consumers no longer buy where you find this tipping point [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2333.46s)]
*  I don't know if you guys have been to the supermarket lately, but man it is crazy expensive [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2338.7400000000002s)]
*  how like prices have gone up like 50 to 100 percent unlike everything at the supermarket and [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2343.7400000000002s)]
*  This is like it's basically impossible [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2349.94s)]
*  We could deal with it, but like a large percentage of people [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2352.5800000000004s)]
*  This is a big deal in terms of like now you have to budget your life and you spend less now tonight [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2355.82s)]
*  When we're here in Portofino we go in the morning to the fishmonger and we'll buy you know fish for the family [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2360.46s)]
*  It is unbelievably expensive and you know, we always think to ourselves [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2368.2200000000003s)]
*  How is it possible that folks can actually choose to eat healthy and local if they want to it's not [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2372.1800000000003s)]
*  What was the whole fish tell us? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2378.78s)]
*  You know like if you want to have like locally caught soul it's like 48 euros a kilogram [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2381.86s)]
*  Wow and like it's expensive and [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2389.2999999999997s)]
*  It's expensive for all around [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2393.2999999999997s)]
*  So to feed a family of seven, which is what we are [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2395.9399999999996s)]
*  You'll have to spend, you know hundred fifty two hundred dollars. It's not sustainable. It's not [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2399.74s)]
*  Something that can that make sense for enough people anymore because that probably used to be 40 bucks or 30 bucks [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2406.5s)]
*  But Freeberg is right like we're in a real serious problem because it's it's like these systems have remained [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2413.34s)]
*  the way that they have been for a very long time and [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2419.82s)]
*  While other industries like the tech industry have captured all these incredible efficiencies [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2423.42s)]
*  But the problem is that then these other industries are what supports everyday people's everyday lives [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2429.58s)]
*  And in the absence of a way to actually reduce cost and improve quality [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2434.7000000000003s)]
*  You end up where we are today and I don't think that that's sustainable [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2439.2599999999998s)]
*  Freeberg greater chance of a recession in the next year or not a recession you have to give an answer [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2442.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's a great chance of a recession [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2447.4199999999996s)]
*  Majority chance of recession gun [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2449.98s)]
*  But I do think that there's going to be government programs to mitigate the effects [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2451.98s)]
*  Meaning you could see the markets the equity markets continue to rally [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2456.2999999999997s)]
*  On some of the government programs and government activity [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2460.14s)]
*  Which has become kind of like the learned behavior of the economy [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2463.98s)]
*  The learned behavior. It's like pavlovian [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2468.06s)]
*  It's like we we have a we have an economic problem the government step the government steps in and spends money [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2470.78s)]
*  Let me get an answer from sax the reason why the markets could rally in the midst of a recession is because interest rates get cut [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2474.94s)]
*  We've already seen that the expectations of rate cuts have now grown substantially the markets are starting to price in [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2481.5s)]
*  100 to 150 basis points of rate cuts this year [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2488.46s)]
*  Where before it was more like 25 to 50 basis points [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2492.38s)]
*  So obviously lower interest rates make stocks go up [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2496.14s)]
*  So I think that's the the main driver of the rally you're seeing right now jcal [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2499.8199999999997s)]
*  Not the prospects for increased efficiency because I think you know those prospects were already there [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2503.5s)]
*  So are you majority case recession or majority case not recession in the next year? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2508.38s)]
*  I've been predicting recession for like three years now because I just think when you jack up interest rates [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2513.1s)]
*  So suddenly so violently you get recession. So I guess if I if you put me down i'd say [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2516.7799999999997s)]
*  I recession and i'll tell you one of the reasons one of the reasons why interestingly i've just checked the notes [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2522.9399999999996s)]
*  sax you predicted five of the [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2529.02s)]
*  Nine of the last five recessions. I know I know it look it's the same recession that i've been predicting [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2531.58s)]
*  It's very simple when you jack up interest rates from near zero to five and a half percent [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2536.06s)]
*  That makes everything much more expensive unless the government spends money [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2541.8199999999997s)]
*  Which is in the counterbalance, right? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2546.8599999999997s)]
*  And that's a lot of why governments do and and by the way, I have a theory on this [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2548.46s)]
*  I think this is also why we have an open border policy [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2551.82s)]
*  Or why um the current administration has pushed an open border policy because that can also be deflationary to counteract the effects of [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2554.46s)]
*  The interest rate accrual because it lowers wages overall and fills wages. It increases the workforce, etc [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2561.58s)]
*  It creates more competitive workforce [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2567.9s)]
*  But no one's allowed to publicly say that and I do think that that's one of the primary motivating factors of having an open border policy [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2569.42s)]
*  Well, people have been saying it. I think you just did [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2575.58s)]
*  It's well said if you look at job creation over the last four years [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2578.94s)]
*  There's been no net new job creation for native-born americans. All the job creation has been [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2582.86s)]
*  Foreign-born or because native-born americans have too high of a wage expectation. That's the fundamental problem, right? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2588.6s)]
*  They're too affluent. I agree. I don't think it's too high, right? And i'm not making an argument one way or the other [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2594.06s)]
*  I'm just highlighting. I think that this is one of the motivators for the policy [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2598.06s)]
*  I think it'd be a lot better to let their wages rise. But in any event, let's not get political on it just to the point [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2601.18s)]
*  About recession jason. I mean, yeah, look i've been predicting the same recession [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2606.8599999999997s)]
*  But I think one of the reasons why it might finally come now [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2610.9399999999996s)]
*  If first of all, you've got a lot of investors are suddenly worried about it. There's been a big sentiment shift [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2614.2999999999997s)]
*  I think the other thing is I don't think we know all the bad news yet [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2619.3399999999997s)]
*  Unknown unknowns. Yeah [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2623.3399999999997s)]
*  Well, none of us were tracking the yen carry trade like very I mean it was something we may have heard of but it's not [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2624.7799999999997s)]
*  Like we were actively thinking about it until this past week [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2630.2999999999997s)]
*  And the question is how many more things are out there like that and I also think that the pattern with this administration [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2633.58s)]
*  Has been to hide the ball. They hid [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2639.8199999999997s)]
*  Biden's senility for years. Yeah, not to get political though. So actually just [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2642.46s)]
*  To get political not to get political fighting fighting fighting. Yeah, not to get political but this is just a fact [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2647.5s)]
*  Look, it's not political. I was about to give him an award for saying not to get political [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2653.98s)]
*  I know [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2657.98s)]
*  I'm making an economic point here actually and you guys can decide if i'm just being partisan or whether I have a good point [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2660.3s)]
*  Here, which is look, I think the mo of this administration has been to hide the ball [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2665.34s)]
*  And any good news they would have reported. Do you think that they're reporting all the bad news? [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2671.02s)]
*  I don't I think there's more bad news that's going to come out after the election because there's too many incentives for people to [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2675.5s)]
*  Hide it and for people who don't know we're talking about the concept of black swans in order to have a black swan [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2680.7s)]
*  It has to be something you're not aware of and it has to be have a dramatic impact [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2685.9s)]
*  The yen trade would not fall into this because people were well aware of it [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2690.78s)]
*  Even if it wasn't front page news and it didn't have a dramatic impact, but there could be black swans sitting there [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2694.46s)]
*  obviously the box one that you can think of [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2699.82s)]
*  recently would be [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2702.3s)]
*  In the great financial crisis the subprime mortgage that truly was massively impactful and it was not known [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2704.06s)]
*  Dot-com was known [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2711.4199999999996s)]
*  And was massively impacted you need both of those categories to define a black swan [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2713.02s)]
*  And there could be black swans, right? [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2717.02s)]
*  Sax is what you're saying when you said that the yen carry trade didn't have a big impact [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2718.2999999999997s)]
*  That's because the bank of japan backed off [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2722.3799999999997s)]
*  So if they kept going with it, we don't know what the impact would have been [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2724.94s)]
*  Correct, but it didn't so just some people who are tracking the black swan tracker just the more, you know, let's talk about apple [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2728.7s)]
*  Chamath, i'll give you your flowers right now. They're coming to you. Just look to your left here comes a huge bouquet because [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2736.2200000000003s)]
*  You predicted I didn't actually send you flowers. He looked to his left, but here's your virtual flowers you predicted [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2742.38s)]
*  I think absolutely [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2748.94s)]
*  Correctly that the less [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2751.48s)]
*  Berkshire Hathaway and buffett talk in their [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2754.7000000000003s)]
*  documents and their letters and at their events about a trade [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2758.84s)]
*  The more they're falling out of love with it and [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2763.98s)]
*  I understand berkshire hathaway has sold half of their largest position [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2767.1000000000004s)]
*  Which is apple some people are saying because they don't have faith in the company some people are saying because they're over [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2771.1000000000004s)]
*  overweighted other people saying because they [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2776.6200000000003s)]
*  Freiburg want to get more cash on the books to make other acquisitions. So chamath your [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2778.6200000000003s)]
*  Maybe just take your victory lap and then we'll I think freiburg double clicked on this and did a deep dive [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2785.0200000000004s)]
*  I don't have much to say. I mean, I think it's been a trend in their letters when [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2790.14s)]
*  He stops mentioning a company in his letter. It's because he's selling [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2795.18s)]
*  It's a great, uh, great read. There it is. Yeah, and that's what happened here. Okay [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2800.54s)]
*  So free bark take us through this well [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2805.2599999999998s)]
*  So it looks like since the start of the year they've sold 55 percent of their holdings in apple [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2807.18s)]
*  And if you look at the end of the year nick if you could pull up this image with the pie chart [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2812.7799999999997s)]
*  This is what berkshire's stock holdings were in [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2816.86s)]
*  Their non-majority owned businesses so businesses that they don't own the business outright [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2820.78s)]
*  And 50 percent of their portfolio was in apple at 174 billion dollars. We obviously saw apple's stock price peak [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2826.7000000000003s)]
*  highest level ever just a few days ago [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2835.02s)]
*  But it has since come down as it was reported that since the start of the year now [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2838.6200000000003s)]
*  Berkshire sold 55 percent [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2843.26s)]
*  Of this position so some people are arguing that [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2845.5s)]
*  They've got a point of view on the company strategy and competent competitive kind of landscape [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2849.1000000000004s)]
*  Some folks have argued that the valuation multiple has gotten too high trading at nearly 30 times earnings [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2854.2200000000003s)]
*  The stock has risen 900 percent since berkshire bought the stock in 2016 nine bagger [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2859.6600000000003s)]
*  Nicely done. Yeah, and some people would argue that the percent of the portfolio is too high at over 50 percent as you can see here [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2865.5s)]
*  at the start of the year [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2871.9s)]
*  But you know i'll kind of provide some of the counter arguments [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2874.06s)]
*  You know warren buffett does not do much analysis on corporate strategy when he provides reviews of the stocks that he's picked [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2876.54s)]
*  He often finds and talks a lot about great managers that generate great returns [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2883.1800000000003s)]
*  And he sticks with them and he sticks with them sometimes for many many decades [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2888.06s)]
*  The management in this company has not changed the return profile on cash invested in cash returned has only improved since he put money in [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2892.06s)]
*  They're generating more cash flow. They're offering more dividends [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2899.1s)]
*  They're doing more stock buybacks and he's happy to be concentrated over the years [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2901.5s)]
*  He's made large bets on single companies to the point that sometimes he just outright buys the entire company like he did with geico [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2905.26s)]
*  In 1996 he always talks a lot about finding a company that is run by great managers [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2911.98s)]
*  It has a premium product with a nice high margin and a durable moat strong brand value as I look at [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2916.78s)]
*  Kind of what's really gone on here [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2923.18s)]
*  It feels to me like the difference between apple and some of the other big holdings in his portfolio [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2925.18s)]
*  Is that many of those other businesses are regulated monopolies? [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2930.7799999999997s)]
*  So bnsf railway is regulated by the federal railroad administration [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2934.4599999999996s)]
*  Berkshire energy which owns mid-american is a regulated utility the prices that they charge consumers are set by the government [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2938.54s)]
*  So they have a market that's locked in the prices are set. They have locked in distribution [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2944.62s)]
*  They have locked in utility value and the same is true in the insurance business geico's rates are approved and set effectively [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2949.3399999999997s)]
*  By state regulators berkshire has a moat because they've got the largest capital base and they've got this machine that just keeps generating cash [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2955.9s)]
*  And the rates are publicly set by government [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2962.3s)]
*  Apple however is not regulated and it is very clear that apple is facing very deep and severe financial [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2965.58s)]
*  Impact from the regulatory authorities that are overseeing the business. So if you look at the google antitrust, right? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2972.14s)]
*  We're going to get into the google deal in a second [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2977.02s)]
*  Yeah [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2979.02s)]
*  There's a real regulatory risk there because google's paying apple 20 billion dollars a year to be the default search engine [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2979.42s)]
*  Apple also has a very deep relationship with china [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2985.58s)]
*  They have a lot of manufacturing being done in china and they sell a lot of product into china [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2988.62s)]
*  So as regulators start to take a harder look as they said they're going to at companies relationships with china [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2993.18s)]
*  That's a real risk to apple advertising tracking users and then the subscription fees that are charged to consumers and most importantly [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=2998.78s)]
*  We've talked a lot about the 30 big that apple takes on their app store and how regulators are now stepping in and take a look [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3005.5s)]
*  At this so because this business is not yet a regulated monopoly [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3011.74s)]
*  It may be a monopoly in many senses of the word [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3015.8199999999997s)]
*  It's not regulated yet and that transition could be financially painful for apple [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3018.14s)]
*  Once they get to the other side it starts to look a lot more like a large-scale birch here type business [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3022.3799999999997s)]
*  So that that's my kind of summary take on what's going on with apple awesome guys [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3027.3399999999997s)]
*  I don't know. I think it's pretty deft uh sax your thoughts on this massive increase in cash and what bircher hathaway? [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3031.2599999999998s)]
*  Is thinking what is warren buffett thinking here is it this became he became overweight apple [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3038.6200000000003s)]
*  Or that he's building up cash because the recession is coming and wants to buy things on the cheap [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3043.5s)]
*  Well or regulation to preberg's point when we had this global sell-off on sunday monday [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3047.5800000000004s)]
*  A lot of people were sharing this chart online and pointing out that [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3053.02s)]
*  Buffett was sitting on this gigantic cash pile by far the biggest cash pile that he's ever sat on [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3056.46s)]
*  We then had a market recovery so people aren't really talking about this [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3061.26s)]
*  But it does stand to reason that buffett is building up a a war chest here [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3064.86s)]
*  And he's somewhat defensively positioned you can see that, you know [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3070.6200000000003s)]
*  It wasn't like 20 21 22 the cash pile went down because he started making a bunch of investments [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3074.1400000000003s)]
*  Now the cash pile is really high. So [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3080.6200000000003s)]
*  It seems logical to infer [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3083.34s)]
*  that he thinks that the risk reward right now is [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3085.6600000000003s)]
*  Is not great on public equities and he is um [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3089.7400000000002s)]
*  Again, he's just a little bit more risk off. What do you think of the regulatory risk argument? [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3093.82s)]
*  Freeberg is floating here chamath. I think that david is right that freeberg is right that [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3098.6200000000003s)]
*  to china thing could have impacted it but [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3104.2200000000003s)]
*  Because he also sold a lot of byd [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3107.98s)]
*  which [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3111.58s)]
*  They've owned since 2008. I think so, you know, that's a chinese ev company [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3112.78s)]
*  And so it could be just that that could have played a part [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3118.1400000000003s)]
*  To be honest, I don't know so wait you're saying china dependency both of those have a china dependency [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3122.06s)]
*  So he maybe felt the overall portfolio. I had too much china dependency. Maybe yeah, I could buy that [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3126.7s)]
*  That seems like reasonably logical. I think the thing to remember though is that these decisions [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3131.74s)]
*  I think have been stewing [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3137.02s)]
*  For at least a couple quarters [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3139.74s)]
*  Remember like, you know that letter that he writes was not written yesterday, right? That was being drafted months and months ago [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3142.22s)]
*  So these decisions were made or even longer [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3150.22s)]
*  So I think these decisions were made a while back [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3154.7799999999997s)]
*  another reason if we're going to play kind of [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3158.2999999999997s)]
*  Conspiracy theorists is like, you know after the death of charlie monger [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3161.64s)]
*  maybe what he's starting to do is [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3166.22s)]
*  Consolidate the book so that it can transition elegantly [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3169.64s)]
*  To greg abel when buffett passes away [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3173.74s)]
*  And so that could be another let me unpack that for a second [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3177.02s)]
*  So when you say that you're saying he wants to hand it off with less risk in it [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3179.66s)]
*  So dependency on one stock would be risk a dependency on china would be risk [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3184.22s)]
*  He wants to make it really clean. So the handoff is smoother. He wants to hand off a very organized [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3187.74s)]
*  Book or maybe he and abel he and greg abel have already talked about the kind of [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3193.58s)]
*  Risk book that they want over these next five to ten years [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3198.2999999999997s)]
*  And it reflects a discussion about what the incoming ceo [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3202.22s)]
*  wants [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3206.62s)]
*  It could so there could be all kinds of reasons why I don't I don't really know [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3208.7799999999997s)]
*  I just think that [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3213.8999999999996s)]
*  Apple just back to free bergs core thesis [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3215.66s)]
*  I agree with many of his general points. I'm not sure that they affected the berkshire strategy [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3219.1s)]
*  But apple is sort of a little bit wayward [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3223.8199999999997s)]
*  it is a [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3226.7799999999997s)]
*  Company with an effective and unregulated monopoly or duopoly [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3228.2999999999997s)]
*  That doesn't really know what to do [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3233.6s)]
*  And I think that that's the biggest problem with that company and that's independent of buffett selling now or selling a year from now or having [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3237.52s)]
*  Not sold a year before [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3244.56s)]
*  Once you're regulated, you know what the prices are. You know what you can do. You know where you can go [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3246.6400000000003s)]
*  And all that risk is off the table. That's what is a feature of all of those other monopolies he owns [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3251.92s)]
*  Is that the government has a role in it by the way highly predictable business [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3257.76s)]
*  By the way, and you mentioned the google thing but [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3262.08s)]
*  This clearly was not part of his calculus [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3265.12s)]
*  I think he just got very lucky [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3268.3999999999996s)]
*  but if you're [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3271.12s)]
*  Holding apple today [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3272.24s)]
*  I think you have to take the 20 billion dollars that google [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3274.24s)]
*  Pays you every year [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3277.9199999999996s)]
*  Which comes in at 99 margin and you should probably sensitize the value of apple [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3279.68s)]
*  We're not having that 20 billion if this antitrust ruling against google stands [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3286.24s)]
*  Yeah, that alone could be worth upwards of half a trillion to a trillion dollars depending on what multiple you want to put on that 20 [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3291.4399999999996s)]
*  Well, I mean what's crazy is the apple apple still up to 214? [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3299.2s)]
*  Which is 11 12 higher than it was at the start of this year at 185 the stock is [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3304.96s)]
*  Just coming off of its all-time highs at 230 a share. So it's just barely off the all-time highs [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3311.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, this is just an extraordinary amount of cash to be held by both apple apples [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3316.56s)]
*  You know also has over 100 billion in cash now warren buffett has close to 300 billion [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3321.52s)]
*  Allocators want to make trades and they got a better obviously he's got a better trade [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3328.3s)]
*  I think he can make on this whether it's the five percent [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3332.0800000000004s)]
*  He's going to get on the 300 billion or maybe there's something he wants to buy. That's another possibility. So [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3334.1600000000003s)]
*  A great job wrapping this all up [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3339.44s)]
*  And let's pivot to the federal judge that ruled that google has an illegal monopoly in search [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3341.84s)]
*  And advertising this is huge news. Perhaps this is the biggest news in the tech industry for a couple years on monday [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3348.7200000000003s)]
*  A judge ruled that google had acted illegally to maintain its monopoly in online search [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3355.52s)]
*  If you remember this was filed under the trump administration in 2020 by the doj [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3361.36s)]
*  The 277 page ruling agrees [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3367.2000000000003s)]
*  That google abused its search business monopoly by paying billions of dollars to third-party platforms like apple and samsung [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3370.3999999999996s)]
*  In order to be their default search engine. So it's not just that you have the monopoly. It's how you maintain the monopoly [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3376.72s)]
*  This is called tac traffic acquisition cost. We've talked about it here many times according to the suit google [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3384.3199999999997s)]
*  Conducts around 90 of web searches. I think we all know that companies disputing that claim [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3390.48s)]
*  The ruling doesn't contain remedies yet for google's behavior [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3395.68s)]
*  They're going to decide that in a subsequent ruling. Obviously google is going to fight this [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3399.7599999999998s)]
*  It could result in a change in business practices i.e. They cannot pay firefox samsung [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3404.48s)]
*  Apple to be the default search engine anymore. That will lead to many interesting possibilities. Uh, chermont and I were [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3410.8s)]
*  discussing them on x [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3417.92s)]
*  and so [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3419.68s)]
*  This is huge news. Uh, this is going to be great [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3420.96s)]
*  I think for the search engine market, I know [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3424.1600000000003s)]
*  apple [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3426.88s)]
*  From my time doing maha mahalo a human powered search engine over 10 years ago when I sent it [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3428.0s)]
*  To steve jobs. He opened it up in the middle of the night and started playing with it and there were many [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3433.44s)]
*  reviews of [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3437.44s)]
*  Or many rumors of apple wanting to be in the search business because they had a contentious relationship with google obviously [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3440.1600000000003s)]
*  when google competed with android that upset steve jobs greatly [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3446.2400000000002s)]
*  and [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3450.6400000000003s)]
*  and [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3452.08s)]
*  also [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3453.36s)]
*  google created chrome which also [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3454.8s)]
*  safari and chrome competing with each other. It's not out of the question. I think tremoth that [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3457.92s)]
*  You could see apple [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3462.88s)]
*  When they lose this 20 30 billion dollar deal for tac to start their own search engine by duck ducko brave has an amazing search engine [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3465.12s)]
*  and a search api [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3472.48s)]
*  I and they've obviously they've got a crawler. So people don't know this but apple has a crawler my prediction is [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3474.24s)]
*  Apple buys a search engine and they go it alone and expand their advertising network like amazon uber and other companies have what's your take on this? [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3480.64s)]
*  And what we're going to see in the future will this ruling stand up and then what are the downstream market impacts? [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3487.8399999999997s)]
*  I think that [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3493.68s)]
*  this google thing [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3494.9599999999996s)]
*  Is the most important thing that's happened in tech? [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3497.7599999999998s)]
*  since the [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3502.0s)]
*  microsoft doj [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3503.3399999999997s)]
*  decision in 2000 internet explorer [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3505.2s)]
*  Yeah, because if you if you go back to that consent decree in 2000 [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3508.0s)]
*  It essentially handcuffed this incredibly [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3512.2400000000002s)]
*  foreboding company [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3515.92s)]
*  For more than a decade while all kinds of innovations happened. So they missed out on two huge waves, right? [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3517.76s)]
*  Microsoft essentially missed out on [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3524.54s)]
*  Social and then they missed out on mobile [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3526.88s)]
*  Largely as a result of that consent decree and then they were able to catch up and embrace sas and the cloud amazing [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3529.44s)]
*  Amazing but there is this small [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3535.92s)]
*  Oh outcome here [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3540.4s)]
*  Which is essentially a consent decree [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3542.5600000000004s)]
*  Where google gets handcuffed for some number of years? [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3545.1200000000003s)]
*  and it creates [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3548.88s)]
*  a couple of big waves of innovation of new companies [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3550.88s)]
*  That can succeed [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3555.1200000000003s)]
*  That may not have otherwise been able to succeed [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3556.7200000000003s)]
*  in the absence of such a consent decree and [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3560.1600000000003s)]
*  A good example of this would be the ai-powered search experiences that you're starting to see whether it's from [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3563.52s)]
*  Open ai or perplexity or a few of these other folks [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3569.6s)]
*  the big o [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3574.56s)]
*  Outcome though is more if you go back to the ma bel kind of thing where the company gets broken up [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3575.8399999999997s)]
*  I think that the odds of that are extremely unlikely [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3584.16s)]
*  So I think the big o outcome [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3587.92s)]
*  Is probably something that you can pretty safely take off the table. I think it's going to be a little low outcome [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3590.64s)]
*  But the point is that there's a distribution here between these two things [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3596.48s)]
*  That this judge will be in control of [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3600.8s)]
*  And I think that [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3603.6800000000003s)]
*  Again, again, i'm just guessing [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3605.36s)]
*  I think both the democrats and the republicans will really support whatever happens here [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3607.92s)]
*  And that's not necessarily because i don't think that's necessarily because they have a bone to pick with google [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3613.52s)]
*  I think that you know, they have bones to pick with other companies more than google [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3618.16s)]
*  But I think that it it starts to set the tone for [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3623.2799999999997s)]
*  Being able to check big tech in a very meaningful and productive way and I think that that has [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3627.7599999999998s)]
*  important ramifications for washington [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3634.16s)]
*  Okay, sax not to make it political but this is [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3637.2s)]
*  The government stopping corporate america, so it can't not be political what's your take here? [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3640.72s)]
*  And what will we see in the future more regulation more rulings like this slap on the wrist breakup? [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3645.2s)]
*  Is this more to come or this is peak regulation in your mind of big tech? [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3650.8799999999997s)]
*  Well, I I think this is a good decision [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3656.9599999999996s)]
*  I mean google clearly is a monopoly in fact [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3658.72s)]
*  It's at least two or three monopolies they have monopoly in search their monopoly in advertising and they at least have a dominant position in video with youtube [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3661.04s)]
*  And I think that it would be great if the government broke up this company [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3668.72s)]
*  I mean, it should be it should be at least three or four companies [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3673.44s)]
*  I mean there should be search should be its own company advertising should be its own company youtube should be spun out [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3675.7599999999998s)]
*  And then I don't know if g suite should be a separate company or should get lumped in with search [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3681.68s)]
*  I I don't know, but I think this should be at least three or four companies [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3685.12s)]
*  And I think republicans will be on board with that because frankly google's a threat to democracy [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3689.2s)]
*  If you go to google and search for search results of anything related to the election, it is clearly so biased [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3695.4399999999996s)]
*  Explain that yeah, give an example if you want to get the latest info on kamala harris just search for donald trump [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3702.08s)]
*  I mean compare the search results and i've done this and i've posted the results online [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3707.8399999999997s)]
*  If you search for trump, you'll get a bunch of negative articles on trump and you'll get positive articles about harris and then conversely if you search [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3712.56s)]
*  For kamala harris, you'll get positive articles about harris [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3719.52s)]
*  Research for kamala harris, you'll get positive articles about her and it's like trump doesn't exist. It's clearly [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3721.84s)]
*  They have put their thumb on the scale here in favor of the candidate [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3728.7200000000003s)]
*  They prefer as 90 70 percent of their donations indicate here's a real-time search [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3731.6800000000003s)]
*  I just did donald trump as you can see the first one that came up was a harris story about trump and harris [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3735.92s)]
*  Uh google has actually addressed this issue. The issue is actually I think [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3740.32s)]
*  I'll take a little bit of the other side of it not bias in the algorithm but bias in media the overall [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3745.2000000000003s)]
*  Majority of media is left-leaning [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3750.3199999999997s)]
*  and [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3752.72s)]
*  uh, there's a very small amount of [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3753.52s)]
*  uh republican right-leaning media when compared to the left obviously [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3756.22s)]
*  And so when you do a search for donald trump, you know [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3761.44s)]
*  You've got the first three choices new york times left-leaning washington post left-leaning newsweek left-leaning cnn left-leaning delhi be super left-leaning [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3764.0s)]
*  Five of five are left-leaning that really is the issue is that there isn't enough [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3770.3199999999997s)]
*  GOP or right-leaning media to actually make uh this work. That's at least my take on it what's your take? Well, well [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3775.12s)]
*  That's their explanation. Yeah, okay fine, but the problem is yeah [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3781.84s)]
*  They're waiting the publications. They want to wait. Why is daily beast like some authority on the election? They're the most partisan [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3785.92s)]
*  Ridiculous untrustworthy publication when it comes to the election. So why should they be top four? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3792.06s)]
*  I mean, why isn't fox news in there? Why isn't york post in there? Why isn't sub stack in there? There's a lot of great [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3796.96s)]
*  Publications on sub stack so they are very selectively choosing the publications who you're right are in the tank [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3803.1200000000003s)]
*  for the democrats so that they are reflecting the bias of the mainstream media, but [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3809.36s)]
*  they are [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3814.32s)]
*  Being very selective about what media they show [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3816.0800000000004s)]
*  And even so kamala harris [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3819.36s)]
*  And let me just give the statistics here here. Hold on kamala harris. Uh, I just did a search [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3821.52s)]
*  First five new york times nbc the hill cnn is the hill right or left? [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3826.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know. They're left. Would you say sex? It's left. Yeah left and then forbes [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3832.32s)]
*  Which I think would be considered right and then fox obviously right? [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3836.48s)]
*  So, I mean it's just the percentage of news sources here often. Yeah, the guardians often rank right? So there's another two [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3840.32s)]
*  Yeah, so it would be like three of eight in this case. I want you to put on the screen this yeah [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3847.28s)]
*  Go ahead. You can do it. I I tweeted some receipts [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3852.32s)]
*  Please click on the screenshot so I can show you the side by side [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3854.56s)]
*  And you'll see what i'm talking about. Okay, I searched for donald trump [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3857.6800000000003s)]
*  What do I get news about harris the first this is on my phone, so this is mobile [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3860.96s)]
*  The articles are all basically about harris criticizing trump [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3866.0s)]
*  Okay, then the second carousel is about the project 2025 director stepping down [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3869.68s)]
*  Which is pretty tangential of trump but is a major democratic line of attack on trump [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3875.6s)]
*  So this whole thing seems rigged to support the dnc point of view on trump same thing [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3881.44s)]
*  You search donald trump latest news same thing. There's some weird story about donald trump's nephew [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3887.28s)]
*  I didn't even know he about this person but somehow they're elevating it to be a major story [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3892.2400000000002s)]
*  And again, the first carousel is all about harris now keep going, please [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3897.1200000000003s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. Okay. Now we look at kamala harris top stories just harris no news about trump got the next one [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3901.6800000000003s)]
*  Same thing [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3910.0800000000004s)]
*  Okay, so the point is that when you search for trump you get news about harris and criticism of trump when you search for [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3911.12s)]
*  harris you get positive news about harris [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3919.2s)]
*  There's no way you can tell me that this is fair or this is the result of an algorithm that hasn't been tampered with [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3922.0s)]
*  This is very clearly programmed. I mean you okay. I'm gonna take care cells depending on which candidate you search for [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3928.08s)]
*  I'm gonna take the complete other side of this but freeberg. I want to give you a chance because you worked at google [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3933.68s)]
*  I think you know a lot about the algorithm [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3938.32s)]
*  What is there? [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3940.7200000000003s)]
*  An explanation for this that makes technical logical sense given what you know about the algorithm and then i'll give my position then shamath you [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3942.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3949.28s)]
*  There's very little kind of editorialization going on with respect to showing the rankings of the new sources [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3950.0s)]
*  The ranking of the new sources is typically set by some ranking algorithm. The algorithm is usually around click-throughs [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3956.96s)]
*  views [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3964.0s)]
*  Popularity of the sites how many visitors there are so there are other metrics that drive the order [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3965.18s)]
*  so for example if nbc cnn [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3970.2999999999997s)]
*  Fox news all have kind of higher rankings than some smaller publication [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3973.4199999999996s)]
*  They're going to end up higher in the the ranking algorithm because they have a higher call it quality score [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3978.14s)]
*  There's also measures on how often people click through and come back the bounce back rate [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3982.94s)]
*  So if they click through an article and then come back that can actually [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3987.2599999999998s)]
*  Reduce the ranking versus if they click through and stay on the site [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3991.1800000000003s)]
*  So there's a lot of factors that go into the ranking algorithm [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3994.78s)]
*  The thing that probably upsets people is that there isn't any transparency into this [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=3997.1s)]
*  So there's no understanding on how these things are ranked how they're set and it's probably very good guidance and feedback that there should be [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4000.7000000000003s)]
*  More transparency and openness and i'm not necessarily trying to defend anyone's product or behavior [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4006.62s)]
*  I'm just saying that there's a certainly a lack of understanding on why one thing is being shown versus another [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4011.6600000000003s)]
*  I'll also say sacs it is probably the case or there might be the case that there's many more sites potentially putting out [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4015.98s)]
*  pro harris [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4022.78s)]
*  Articles and there are putting out pro trump articles which can start to overweight the algorithm as you know [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4023.98s)]
*  Or overweight the rankings that are showing up. So that might also be feeding into this that the general [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4029.1800000000003s)]
*  News media bias is what you're actually seeing versus a google bias, right? [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4035.1800000000003s)]
*  I I don't believe that let me get you my hold on. Let me get your mouth involved [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4040.6200000000003s)]
*  Here on this issue and then i'll give my position [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4044.2200000000003s)]
*  I do want to come back to the anti-trust ruling in a minute [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4049.66s)]
*  Okay, absolutely sacs thinks the the fix is in friberg thinks this has explained algorithmic me, but [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4052.46s)]
*  That google could do a better job explaining and being more transparent about the algorithm. I agree with that [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4059.42s)]
*  Always considered a black box go look and I agree 100 as I explained [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4066.3s)]
*  Yeah, the number of independent journalists in left-leaning publications is like 30 to 1 at [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4071.2599999999998s)]
*  Places like fox news, which is largely we talked about this countless times [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4078.54s)]
*  There are so many there needs to be more investment in journalists by republicans [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4081.8199999999997s)]
*  There are so many more liberal journalists and there's so many more liberal media outlets out there 20 to 1 is a big [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4086.62s)]
*  It's probably 20 to 1. Yeah. Yeah, of course. I understand that the mainstream media is hopelessly biased [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4092.46s)]
*  Please remember you said that when we discuss it. No, no, no, the future [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4097.58s)]
*  Saks I gotta stop you there. He didn't say biased what we said was it's 20 or 30 to 1 it's [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4104.0599999999995s)]
*  Outnumbering so if the pool of things to search and come up with is 30 to 1 [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4109.0s)]
*  It's of course going to appear biased, which is what they need to do is they need to show who's in the ranking [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4113.18s)]
*  What percentage are left? What percentage are right? What percentage are committed middle of the road show that at the top? [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4118.54s)]
*  The mainstream media is biased. We all know that you can defend it. However, you want to defend it you can nobody's supporting [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4124.14s)]
*  Okay, fine. So we agree on that. I don't know why you're making agree with you five times making you know points [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4129.5s)]
*  Okay [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4134.38s)]
*  My point about google is they're reinforcing the bias because they uprank the mainstream media sources and they downrank the sources that provide a [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4134.86s)]
*  Distant opinion or an alternative opinion again. Why is vanity fair up ranked above the new york post? [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4142.78s)]
*  I don't know because is that because of their journalistic quality? I don't think so [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4148.38s)]
*  One way to think about this. Why is it that that kamala harris search result? [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4152.54s)]
*  Does not say anything about trump, but the trump search result has a carousel on kamala harris [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4157.820000000001s)]
*  That looks program to me. Yeah, that looks program. Okay. I'll tell you the also answer [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4163.580000000001s)]
*  Um, this was the week kamala or this the last 10 days or so of kamala taking the position [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4168.700000000001s)]
*  Raising tons of money hiring her vp and trump disappearing from public life for 10 days [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4175.02s)]
*  So there's also a on top of the 30 to 1 ratio. Let's say left-leaning journalists to right [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4181.58s)]
*  You also have this was kamala's coronation week. So therefore it's going to be I don't think [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4186.860000000001s)]
*  Google is in the bag with their algorithm. Anyway, I think it's the source material they're indexing tremop. What are your thoughts? [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4192.46s)]
*  one of the things that I like to do when i'm in portofino is [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4199.02s)]
*  When you see these huge yachts in the bay, I like to figure out what they are [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4203.5s)]
*  Okay, and so I use google for like a vessel finder [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4208.780000000001s)]
*  And two of the top three links [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4215.58s)]
*  Send me to spyware [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4219.820000000001s)]
*  And I think to myself every time every year this happens, how is it that in 2024 [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4223.26s)]
*  Google hasn't figured out how to click these links [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4230.9400000000005s)]
*  in a sandbox [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4235.02s)]
*  Isolate the ones that send you to spyware [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4236.54s)]
*  And just take them out of the index [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4239.66s)]
*  And of course they can do it. They have you know, 100 000 people and two trillion a market cap [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4242.38s)]
*  So I think that there's like just the level of [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4249.9s)]
*  technical navel gazing at some level that [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4253.82s)]
*  I think this sets every big company [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4256.7s)]
*  And so there are other examples here that you can look at that are a lot less charged than politics [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4259.0199999999995s)]
*  I think freebrook is right that it's largely algorithmic, but I think david is right in that there is a quality problem [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4265.42s)]
*  I think the solution here is that for certain extremely important moments [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4272.7s)]
*  There needs to be a little bit more intervention [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4278.7s)]
*  And there needs to be a little bit more curation so that it passes the smell test. I mean the the version of this that I [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4281.5s)]
*  That I also experimented with and nick you can find the tweet that I had [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4288.780000000001s)]
*  Was when I was searching for the assassination of donald trump on google, it just that it didn't show up it does show up now [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4293.66s)]
*  So I think they got the message and they fixed it [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4300.94s)]
*  So clearly somebody's listening [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4304.299999999999s)]
*  And I think clearly then the index [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4307.0199999999995s)]
*  changes [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4309.96s)]
*  So I think that both things are possible which is the algorithm can improve [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4312.219999999999s)]
*  and also that [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4318.38s)]
*  certain things before people start to [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4320.0599999999995s)]
*  Complain loudly about this perceived bias [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4323.82s)]
*  There should be enough intervention to make sure that the algorithmic results pass a smell test [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4327.66s)]
*  and if they're not [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4333.66s)]
*  to add some amount of [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4335.259999999999s)]
*  Reinforcement learning or something else some human human curation allows [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4337.32s)]
*  That that allows you to get to a good answer. That's unbiased before we leave this topic cut cut it show this chart [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4341.82s)]
*  Okay, look, this is a chart [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4348.299999999999s)]
*  Of course all of tech all of tech is deeply biased towards the democratic audience may not know okay, okay employee donations to [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4350.9400000000005s)]
*  party are again, it's well over 90 percent of democrats this basically represents the [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4358.62s)]
*  Constituency of silicon valley. Okay inside these companies [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4364.12s)]
*  We also know that google search results use more and more manual interventions freeburg you agree with that right? [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4367.34s)]
*  That over time there's definitely again there's there's meant to not be an editorial process, but there certainly is tweaking of rankings [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4373.82s)]
*  Okay, so all the people doing this stuff are [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4380.54s)]
*  Democrats they're liberal and you're telling me that this does not have an influence. It does not create bias. Come on [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4384.04s)]
*  You can see the bias in a common sense search for trump versus harris [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4389.9s)]
*  I'm just saying like you've you've we've all made a huge leap in this conversation [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4394.22s)]
*  From talking about an antitrust ruling which I will speak to very specifically in a minute [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4398.14s)]
*  To oh my god tech is biased. That's what's driving the you know, the the sense of the nation [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4402.299999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you've noticed sax but more than half the nation is going to vote for donald trump [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4407.58s)]
*  More than half like nearly 60 percent. I think it would be like [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4411.74s)]
*  I think it would be like 70 or 80 percent if it weren't for the bias of the mainstream media being boosted by big tech [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4414.86s)]
*  Well, call it balance in the force then I guess but like hold on a second [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4419.5s)]
*  Maybe maybe not maybe not quite that percentage. But if you look if you look at if you look at issues polling on issues [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4423.099999999999s)]
*  The republican position on most issues is like a 60 to 70 percent winner and yet the elections are a nail biter [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4429.58s)]
*  And I think a lot of it has to do with the influence of the mainstream media and big tech. Okay. Well, let's come back [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4436.54s)]
*  So I think that everyone has what sax is speaking to is a deeply rooted feeling [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4440.86s)]
*  held by politicians held by regulators on one side of the aisle or the other [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4446.14s)]
*  When democrats feel shunned by the search engine or by twitter or by facebook [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4452.22s)]
*  They raise their hand and they say let's regulate these guys [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4457.5s)]
*  When republicans feel shunned because they're not showing up in the news rankings or the algorithms they feel let's regulate these guys [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4460.38s)]
*  When it actually comes down to the court case here is what is being described [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4466.14s)]
*  When you go to apple and you type in a couple of words in the url bar [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4470.46s)]
*  That you want to search for because we've all gotten used to this. You guys may not remember this [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4476.54s)]
*  But nearly 20 years ago when browsers first came out on desktops [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4480.860000000001s)]
*  And on mobile phones [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4485.84s)]
*  You would not be able to just search by typing into the url bar [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4487.44s)]
*  You would have to type in a web search engine in the url bar hit go [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4491.12s)]
*  And then you go to their search box and you type in your result. What happened around the mid 2000s 2004 2005? [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4495.12s)]
*  Is you suddenly were able to type in a couple of words into the url bar of a browser and hit go [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4502.32s)]
*  And it would give you search results [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4508.32s)]
*  The question is what search engine did it give you those results from and that's what this lawsuit is about [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4510.48s)]
*  Google started to pay companies like apple [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4516.48s)]
*  To make google the default search engine when you would type in a couple of words and hit go into the url bar [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4519.84s)]
*  Because search became the primary way of surfing the internet not typing in a url and going to it [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4526.719999999999s)]
*  And then when they started doing that they started to see more search traffic [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4531.679999999999s)]
*  Now the real question from an antitrust perspective is did google [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4535.12s)]
*  leverage its monopoly [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4538.32s)]
*  To pay to continue to be the default search engine to lock in the search market and prevent competition by doing this [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4540.32s)]
*  Well, the judge the judge already said yes, the judge said yes google is monopolizing [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4547.2s)]
*  Search because they're paying to lock in the ability to type in to get the default on the search bar [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4552.4s)]
*  By the way, you can go into the settings and change it [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4558.0s)]
*  But what would the other default be? [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4561.12s)]
*  So now if apple created their own i think you're being you're being too narrow hold on one second [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4563.599999999999s)]
*  You're being too narrow the initial complaint in the microsoft internet explorer thing that kicked off the whole doj thing [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4567.76s)]
*  Versus the consent decree [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4574.8s)]
*  Were two totally different things. I think that you're underestimating the scope of the remedy [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4576.88s)]
*  I get it. Let me finish. So like if they were to then say like let's get let's make sure google can't do that again [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4583.04s)]
*  What's the search engine? Is it bing? [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4589.2s)]
*  Is it apple's search engine? [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4591.76s)]
*  Because then there would be an antitrust claim to say that if there is a default search engine without the consumer having to actively choose [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4593.44s)]
*  What their search engine is someone is monopolizing? [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4598.8s)]
*  The uh the install base that apple has or the install base that whomever has where they are becoming the default search engine [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4602.32s)]
*  Now to your point like the ability for the judge to then say, you know what? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4608.639999999999s)]
*  This is one action of many that you are taking to monopolize search [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4612.4s)]
*  Let's go ahead and figure out how we can prevent you from monopolizing search and this is really focused on search [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4616.32s)]
*  It becomes a very hard leap to say let's break up the company [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4621.84s)]
*  There's bias in the news feed that you guys are ranking. This has nothing to do with search engine rankings [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4625.28s)]
*  It has nothing to do with owning youtube. It has nothing to do with like owning cloud [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4630.16s)]
*  It has everything to do with google monopolizing the search business, which is the biggest business on the internet [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4634.72s)]
*  I do think that they go that's where that concept gets narrowed [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4640.16s)]
*  Off and where there's a lot of paths, but I question what path is there going to be that's not going to be antitrust triggering [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4643.12s)]
*  No, no, no, I don't think that's a narrowing again the big o outcome of breaking up the company like what happened in mabel [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4648.48s)]
*  I don't think that's going to happen here a little o outcome [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4654.32s)]
*  That is a consent decree similar to the one that microsoft had to sign [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4657.5199999999995s)]
*  Is very likely but what I want you to understand is the way that that started which was literally around internet explorer and bundling [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4661.599999999999s)]
*  versus the consent decree [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4669.68s)]
*  Was meaningful orders of magnitude broader [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4671.76s)]
*  So what i'm saying is this little o outcome is going to be much bigger than the scope of this lawsuit [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4675.4400000000005s)]
*  And if they don't man, they have dodged an enormous bullet [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4681.6s)]
*  And all i'm saying is the I think [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4686.56s)]
*  If you had to be a betting person they settled on that right? [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4690.08s)]
*  Like with with microsoft if I remember right it was an agreed settlement like ultimately they signed there was it was a consent decree [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4693.68s)]
*  Basically what happened is for 10 years the doj became the became the product managers of all critical projects inside of microsoft, right? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4700.0s)]
*  The point is this which is that when microsoft went through this? [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4707.6s)]
*  The government and they had broad support [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4712.320000000001s)]
*  Use that consent decree as a way to essentially hobble this company [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4715.4400000000005s)]
*  So that other competition could come in that competition was [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4719.92s)]
*  Yeah, I don't just finish it wasn't it wasn't just it wasn't just in the narrow scope of where that initial focus started [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4723.4400000000005s)]
*  I hear you what i'm saying is this judge will read that for sure [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4729.92s)]
*  And I would and if and if google gets away [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4734.4800000000005s)]
*  With just having to do something around tac and search [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4737.84s)]
*  Yeah, it they have dodged an enormous bullet. No, I think you're look I think you're right [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4742.08s)]
*  And I think the reason you're right is because of how inflamed sax is [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4746.96s)]
*  Because the way that sax feels I think is the way that every no [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4750.8s)]
*  I think I think I know I think if I think if sax gets his way [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4754.240000000001s)]
*  It'll be a big o outcome and they're gonna no I know I know I think that's where everyone wants it to go [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4757.5199999999995s)]
*  Sax you wanted to know what I'm what I'm saying is the little o outcome is meaningfully worse than where this lawsuit is [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4762.24s)]
*  I'm gonna make my final statement. There's a strong I agree with you and i'm not trying to defend google [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4768.24s)]
*  And i'm not trying to defend some outcome here. I think you guys are correct [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4772.32s)]
*  I think that because of how inflamed people are at the influence that these companies have meta [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4776.24s)]
*  and twitter [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4782.4s)]
*  And google there is going to be a strong push to do a lot more [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4783.68s)]
*  Than what the narrow focus of the ruling in this particular case to do something much more significant to hurt these companies and make them less [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4788.400000000001s)]
*  influential and less powerful [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4795.34s)]
*  facts [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4797.12s)]
*  Anything to add? [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4798.72s)]
*  I'm not inflamed. I have a point of view that I think is informed by facts and evidence [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4800.08s)]
*  The fact of the matter is the vast vast majority well over 90 percent of the employees at google are liberal democrats [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4805.76s)]
*  And the google search does rely on manual actions and the people performing those actions are again [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4813.22s)]
*  Overwhelmingly from one side of the political aisle furthermore [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4820.88s)]
*  We can see in the search results that they do appear to be hopelessly biased in favor of one candidate at the expense of another [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4823.78s)]
*  I mean you're asking me to deny the evidence my own eyes and ears. I can see what's happening [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4830.66s)]
*  I think most people can see what's happening [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4835.94s)]
*  I do not think that google should be putting its thumb on the scale on one side of the election here [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4838.5s)]
*  And jason you may have a point that is reflecting the bias of the mainstream media. I don't think that makes it [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4844.18s)]
*  Okay [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4849.54s)]
*  I think that google should have to work a little harder to be neutral and they could do that [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4850.1s)]
*  They could do that easily by balancing their new sources [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4854.58s)]
*  Okay, I feel like sax and I got to uh the [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4857.54s)]
*  Perfect place. I agree google's filled with obviously left-leaning. Don't deny that [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4860.66s)]
*  I agree that uh the left the my the media is biased they all picked aside [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4865.7s)]
*  And then I just want to show you one chart because super important for you to understand [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4870.179999999999s)]
*  the number of people in [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4873.78s)]
*  Journalism, this is from 1971 to 2022 who say they are identifying as republican has just absolutely plummeted [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4876.5599999999995s)]
*  I know this and this is what i'm trying to explain to you sax [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4884.26s)]
*  Is an incredible opportunity for your party since you know [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4887.38s)]
*  You're passionate about this is to invest in more journalism invest in more journalists because [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4890.98s)]
*  I don't buy this independence the fact that they're claiming they're independent in journalism. I believe that's capped. I believe they say that [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4896.0199999999995s)]
*  But the gap is 33% now between people who [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4902.66s)]
*  Say they're democrats and people who say they're republican in journalism [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4906.259999999999s)]
*  That is a key piece to this problem and layered on top of it [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4909.379999999999s)]
*  I agree with you that google is filled with liberal people and I agree with you chamath [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4912.259999999999s)]
*  That they need to intervene and put at the top of the search results in news [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4916.259999999999s)]
*  These are the you know, this is what we're indexing. This is the percentage that's left-leaning [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4920.580000000001s)]
*  This is the percentage that's right-leaning and there are a lot of organizations [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4924.5s)]
*  That examine and rate publications on their bias left and right and that's something that google could do [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4927.620000000001s)]
*  That's very unique and that could move the whole country [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4933.9400000000005s)]
*  You're saying which is they could showcase that up top [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4936.820000000001s)]
*  So to my friends at google who are listening do a better job of just being more transparent [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4938.900000000001s)]
*  So we don't have this tension in society. Okay, it's time for sax's red meat sax [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4943.46s)]
*  We have a vp candidate you have been absolutely waiting for this moment [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4949.3s)]
*  The race is a dead heat. Here's your second course of red meat. I brought you that giant this you know what this is [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4955.3s)]
*  This is the state for two. No, it's the state. This is the state for two [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4961.860000000001s)]
*  For one you ordered the steak for two for one sax get in there medium rare. You got your cowboy cut [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4967.3s)]
*  What did you think when you saw? [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4973.54s)]
*  Kamala harris enter vp pick [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4976.18s)]
*  move ahead in [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4979.94s)]
*  almost universally [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4982.0199999999995s)]
*  All uh paul's and prediction markets to the lead over your boys [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4984.1s)]
*  Trump and vance. What did you think of the pick? Go ahead. Enjoy your steak. Well, I was very happy [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4988.82s)]
*  I was very happy with the pick [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4994.66s)]
*  I mean so first of all, I think I said last week or two weeks ago that I thought the pick was would be [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=4996.0199999999995s)]
*  Shapiro josh, shapiro the governor of pennsylvania. It was such an obvious choice for harris [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5000.42s)]
*  Because this whole election could easily come down to 10 000 votes in pennsylvania. It is the tipping point state [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5005.78s)]
*  And harris probably has to win that state in order to win the election [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5012.9s)]
*  And you have a very popular governor of that state. He's got something like 63 percent popularity in that state [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5017.38s)]
*  He's also perceived as a moderate. So he would have helped harris position the ticket more towards the center [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5023.86s)]
*  Which apparently is her goal since she's repudiated all of her [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5031.14s)]
*  Far left positions [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5034.820000000001s)]
*  So it just seemed teed up to be so perfect. And then what happened is there was a smear campaign by the progressive left [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5036.34s)]
*  Against shapiro [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5043.06s)]
*  He was the only one of the vp shortlist candidates that seemed to get all this oppo dumped on him [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5044.5s)]
*  before the pick and that campaign against shapiro seems to have [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5049.22s)]
*  Spooked harris who seems to be fairly risk-averse [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5053.22s)]
*  And she went with this guy tim waltz from minnesota [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5056.74s)]
*  who is a darling of the [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5060.820000000001s)]
*  Radical left and I think that he's already presented many opportunities for attack by the right [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5064.02s)]
*  There's three big issues that I think waltz is going to have to address because republicans are already landing blows on him [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5069.62s)]
*  Number one stolen valor. He has clearly and on several occasions [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5076.1s)]
*  overstayed the extent of his military record [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5082.16s)]
*  Look, obviously i've never served but I know that among people who have this is a very big deal [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5085.22s)]
*  Big big issue campaigns have imploded over this so that's number one. He's got the stolen valid problem number two on trans [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5090.9s)]
*  he seems to have bought into every aspect of the trans agenda and [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5098.9s)]
*  He's made minnesota a sanctuary state for minors who want to come there for puberty blockers and sex reassignment surgeries [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5104.1s)]
*  Even without parental consent [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5112.1s)]
*  The law that gavin newsome just passed or signed that drove elon out of the state [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5114.58s)]
*  Uh tim waltz got there first in minnesota. So [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5119.299999999999s)]
*  He is he is not a centrist. He is very far on the cultural left [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5123.219999999999s)]
*  And then i'd say like a third issue that I don't even know if people have really gotten to yet [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5128.099999999999s)]
*  But I think it will eventually come up [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5132.58s)]
*  is that [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5135.139999999999s)]
*  Waltz was was insanely authoritarian on covid. I mean, this is a guy who told us that minnesotans [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5136.5s)]
*  Live by a motto of mind your own damn business [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5143.4s)]
*  But he set up a covid stitch hotline so people could rat out their neighbors for leaving the house or having dinner parties or walking [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5145.96s)]
*  Their dog without a mask [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5152.92s)]
*  And it was it was real. I mean violators could be punished by 90 days in jail [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5154.6s)]
*  So again, this guy has been to the left of gavin newsome [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5159.08s)]
*  On cultural issues and I think that's going to be a big problem for the harris campaign [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5162.52s)]
*  And I don't really understand why she went with him when there was such an obvious [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5168.12s)]
*  Alternative who was available who could have given her a swing state who could have position sure you don't know why [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5172.4400000000005s)]
*  What are your thoughts and schmuck you want to speculate? [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5178.84s)]
*  Your chance to bash the democrats and speculate go chaman. No, I have no bashing to do I will say [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5184.12s)]
*  two things [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5190.92s)]
*  one is that I think his [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5192.6s)]
*  Stance on [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5196.68s)]
*  This trans stuff is a little problematic in these swing states [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5198.52s)]
*  I say a little only because I think it matters more what kamala stands on all these topics are [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5202.76s)]
*  but I do think that where [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5209.8s)]
*  There's going to be a big judgment issue [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5212.120000000001s)]
*  around her selecting him [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5215.240000000001s)]
*  Is if there is veracity to the stolen valor claims and so [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5218.76s)]
*  When sean ryan [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5224.52s)]
*  Has an example incredible podcast if you guys don't listen to it there [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5226.200000000001s)]
*  It's great, but like you know when he gets to the bottom of this and he will [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5229.96s)]
*  Tim waltz better hope that he told the entire truth [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5234.68s)]
*  Okay, freeberg your thoughts [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5239.160000000001s)]
*  We're dancing on the issue here. You had talked a couple of weeks ago about an organization [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5241.64s)]
*  That didn't want to put a jewish person in the top position or in a top position [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5246.84s)]
*  Do you think that this is or there are any [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5252.2s)]
*  Concerns of shapiro being jewish that caused him not to be selected or do you think maybe he bowed out? [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5256.36s)]
*  Because he wants to run for president as some people are saying and maybe he his star shines a little too bright for the second position [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5262.5199999999995s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5269.639999999999s)]
*  Let's go right to the anti-semitism claims. I'm not going to make that proclamation. I don't know what [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5271.0s)]
*  vice president harris's [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5277.4s)]
*  Decision-making process was I don't know who she talked to what she cared about if she cared if she was even in charge [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5279.48s)]
*  I have no idea [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5284.679999999999s)]
*  All I know is that there have been other conversations i've been privy to behind closed doors [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5286.759999999999s)]
*  Where senior people have been passed over because they are jewish and because of the concerns of someone jewish [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5291.639999999999s)]
*  Being viewed to be in a leadership position in an organization [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5296.839999999999s)]
*  And the impact that that might have that there is a brewing [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5300.12s)]
*  Disprost as a result of the conflict in gaza let me say something about this issue frankly in defense of kamala harris [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5302.84s)]
*  I don't think she's anti-semitic and I I don't think that accusation should ever be made without real evidence [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5309.72s)]
*  Okay [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5315.96s)]
*  That being said van jones who is in a position to know because he's an important political pundit in the democrat party said [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5316.52s)]
*  That one of the reasons why shapiro was passed over is because of this issue and he said that [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5325.240000000001s)]
*  Anti-semitism had become marbled into the democrat party. I don't know exactly what he meant by that [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5331.4s)]
*  I saw I saw that quote that was really jarring actually [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5337.32s)]
*  So marbles is an interesting term. Yeah, that means it's like absolutely in the fabric [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5340.76s)]
*  of the yeah [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5345.88s)]
*  Yeah, so I don't know. I I don't think harris is I think she's just risk-averse and didn't want to alienate certain [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5347.16s)]
*  Factions within the democrat party agree with that statement, right? [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5353.4s)]
*  But me too in the process of being risk-averse she chose this guy waltz who I think has got much bigger vulnerabilities [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5356.5199999999995s)]
*  Than shapiro does and I think the question now is whether waltz is even going to make it to the convention [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5364.599999999999s)]
*  I think he might have to drop out. I don't understand by the way. I saw the dating process that donald trump had with his [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5369.96s)]
*  Vp candidates, right sax and I saw some of it [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5377.719999999999s)]
*  Really up close. Yeah explain [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5381.32s)]
*  Well, well I can only speak to what I saw but it just seemed to me that there was this month's long [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5384.28s)]
*  audition where [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5390.44s)]
*  I think they were just trying to figure out i'm guessing him completely guessing [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5392.36s)]
*  where these folks stood on things but also he was trying to get a sense of [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5397.24s)]
*  The person and whether they got along and whatnot. But what I also suspected is that this person was being [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5401.48s)]
*  highly highly scrutinized behind the scenes [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5408.12s)]
*  On everything that they've said or done [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5411.64s)]
*  Where the person who's going to make the pick in that case donald trump was deciding can I live with these issues or not? [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5414.6s)]
*  what the articles about the vp process on the [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5421.64s)]
*  Democrat side was more painted along the lines of there was a meeting [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5426.92s)]
*  And she kind of liked him [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5432.52s)]
*  And so she went with him [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5434.92s)]
*  And I agree, I don't think there's a anti-semitic bone in her body to be totally honest with you [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5437.64s)]
*  I don't get that sense at all. No, no, I yeah, that's not the issue but the calculus, right? [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5442.68s)]
*  But what I would say is this is the number two person [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5447.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, maybe you should spend more than a day and then maybe people should be really vetting this person [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5451.0s)]
*  Behind [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5458.28s)]
*  closed doors on all of the things that could go wrong [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5459.72s)]
*  And I mean you have to assume that that happened. Yeah, let me make a couple of points there [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5463.4800000000005s)]
*  So number one is trump had a lot more time to vet and got comfortable with his vp candidate [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5467.400000000001s)]
*  Because he's been the presumptive nominee for many months whereas harris inherited [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5474.68s)]
*  The the nominee ship without a primary battle, right? Biden just abdicated less than three weeks ago [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5479.96s)]
*  So that's the reason why she didn't really have time to go through a courtship process for her vp [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5485.96s)]
*  Now as to the vetting process, I agree with you [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5491.0s)]
*  I think it's somewhat inexplicable because these stolen valor claims have been out there for a long time [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5493.32s)]
*  When waltz ran for governor there were former soldiers who came forward and said yeah [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5498.679999999999s)]
*  He was supposed to be the commander of our national guard unit [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5504.12s)]
*  He was supposed to go with us and he quit right before we got deployed [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5507.96s)]
*  to iraq [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5512.2s)]
*  And so these complaints have been out there for a while. Moreover. He has many public statements [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5514.04s)]
*  Saying that he was deployed to operation enduring freedom, which I think was afghanistan [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5519.0s)]
*  And he simply wasn't I mean at least that's what I understand to be the case [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5525.48s)]
*  So or he was deployed during that time. I I think this sounds like a lot of cap. He was deployed during that time [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5529.24s)]
*  But he wasn't in combat, right? Is that he never saw combat and he said that he carried a weapon in combat in war [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5535.799999999999s)]
*  So this isn't like a use of soppy language once or twice [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5543.72s)]
*  This has been around circling him for many years now and there's been many examples of him saying these things on video [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5547.4s)]
*  So my point is can I just say one thing the vetting was very poor. I think the vetting was this is what I was going to say [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5554.44s)]
*  So there's there was there was a great quote [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5559.24s)]
*  and I don't know if this ever made the light of day, but there was a moment where [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5562.12s)]
*  Was thought of as a potential vp nomination he was like a real big democrat stalwart and [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5566.599999999999s)]
*  I don't exactly know the claims so and [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5576.679999999999s)]
*  but i'm not gonna go there, but [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5580.2s)]
*  The phrase that I was told is [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5582.599999999999s)]
*  Doesn't vet [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5585.96s)]
*  And what it was was a way of saying [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5587.88s)]
*  Look we take our time. We understand everybody's background. We know what skeletons are in folks's closets [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5591.64s)]
*  And in that example [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5598.360000000001s)]
*  Whatever was going on [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5600.04s)]
*  Was sufficient enough where he would never really get nominated for something very very big [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5602.6s)]
*  and I think that's sort of what comes up here, which is that [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5608.04s)]
*  In this impassioned desire to make a decision quickly [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5613.56s)]
*  I still think the democratic party had an extra two or three weeks [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5617.64s)]
*  to make sure [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5622.36s)]
*  Tim waltz really bets now. I don't know if whether these claims are true or not again. Somebody will get to the bottom of it [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5624.2s)]
*  But it creates a pall over this campaign [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5632.36s)]
*  too early [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5635.48s)]
*  And where I think kamala probably wants all of that noise away so that she can define what she stands for sort of what we said [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5637.48s)]
*  last time [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5643.32s)]
*  Go after these five big issues that people care about go into the five states on these five issues and try to win this election [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5644.52s)]
*  She can't do that [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5651.160000000001s)]
*  If this is like oh [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5653.160000000001s)]
*  What is your decision making like why did you pick this person? Why did this person lie? [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5655.080000000001s)]
*  So they have to nip this in the bud very quickly look in my view [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5660.200000000001s)]
*  This was an easy choice [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5663.240000000001s)]
*  Even if she didn't like shapiro [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5664.68s)]
*  She could have gone with bichir or she could have gone with markely remember the astronaut markely was one of the top two contenders [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5666.280000000001s)]
*  At least that was what was reported in other words. She could have gone with a moderate from a swing state cnn [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5672.6s)]
*  CNN reported that kamala thought that shapiro was too ambitious. So okay, so why not markely? [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5678.28s)]
*  He would have outshined her for sure shapiro is really good at speaking and eloquent and she's not shapiro shapiro is really sharp [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5683.4s)]
*  I mean that guy is unbelievable [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5690.36s)]
*  Okay, he's on the ball. I'm not saying it has to be shapiro [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5692.68s)]
*  But the the remit here was really clear just strategically you want to choose a moderate from a swing state [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5695.48s)]
*  That's it because this whole election can come down to one state and you want to basically portray yourself as a moderate [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5701.16s)]
*  So this is a very easy assignment [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5706.68s)]
*  Find me a moderate from a swing state and what do they do? [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5709.16s)]
*  They choose a radical from a safe state safe for democrats. They got minnesota locked up [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5712.6s)]
*  Why do they need to take on this baggage? There's no reason for it [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5718.04s)]
*  And charmoth, I do think they rushed the vetting but I think it wasn't because of passion or something like that [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5721.32s)]
*  I think they're running out of time because remember [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5727.08s)]
*  Biden was supposed to be the nominee harris was supposed to be on the ticket as vp [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5729.4s)]
*  They weren't supposed to do this process and then all of a sudden it happened three weeks ago because biden abdicated [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5733.5599999999995s)]
*  Look, I think I think that a vice presidential pick [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5739.5599999999995s)]
*  matters [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5743.54s)]
*  But only so much [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5745.0s)]
*  And I think more than helping [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5746.84s)]
*  I think what vps do on balance is if you pick the wrong person it can meaningfully hurt a campaign [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5749.64s)]
*  I think the you know, dan quail potato thing comes to mind [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5756.04s)]
*  You can become a little bit of a laughing stock which just becomes baggage that you have to overcome [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5760.04s)]
*  And so this is again where it's a little bit of a head scratcher [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5766.92s)]
*  I would just have thought that this would have been a little bit more buttoned up [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5769.8s)]
*  Totally and let me tell you if if waltz doesn't drop the from the ticket [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5774.2s)]
*  I predict there'll be gold star families protesting all of their events and that's gonna be a real headache from now till next year [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5778.36s)]
*  I think that's a real headache from now till the election here is the quote in question harris campaign [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5784.92s)]
*  And this is from the new york times [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5791.4800000000005s)]
*  Had promoted this on social media just so we're clear when we're making all these claims that he did [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5793.56s)]
*  Steal valor that he has not been convicted of stealing valor, which is an actual crime [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5798.52s)]
*  Just so we get things right here on the pod. Here's the quote [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5803.24s)]
*  That he said we can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5807.4s)]
*  Is the only place where those weapons are at [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5811.88s)]
*  And so mr. Waltz never served in combat and that quote that he made [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5814.76s)]
*  I guess people are now weaponizing to say that he's saying [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5820.84s)]
*  Those here's a quote those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are so he was not in war [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5825.64s)]
*  Technically he was a reserve [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5832.52s)]
*  And he is battalion was going to be [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5835.240000000001s)]
*  Uh called he claims so that's a guess what we are questioning and vance said [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5837.72s)]
*  I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did this [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5844.04s)]
*  I could see where people might be a little bit. I can see both sides of this issue. It's actually want to [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5848.76s)]
*  Dunk on him or yeah, i'm not gonna dunk because this is still an unfolding story and it's gonna play out over the next couple weeks [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5853.8s)]
*  And we'll see where it lands, but it's pretty clear that he at a minimum exaggerated [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5859.0s)]
*  His service and he exaggerated his rank I would like to thank both jd vance and waltz for their service [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5865.64s)]
*  I appreciate both of their service. I'll leave it at that from my perspective. Listen, whenever I meet a vet [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5872.6s)]
*  I always thank them for their service, but those vets will tell you you can never exaggerate what you've done [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5877.16s)]
*  You can't say you were in war when you were not in war, of course. Yeah, so I guess we'll see how this plays out [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5883.4s)]
*  All right, everybody [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKDisV_pcI&t=5888.84s)]
