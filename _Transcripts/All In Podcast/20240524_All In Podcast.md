# Scarlett Johansson vs OpenAI, Nvidia's trillion-dollar problem, a vibecession, plastic in our balls
**All In Podcast:** [May 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4)
*  I just want to be clear here, I'm trying to do a docket. And we have to put the kibosh on this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=0.0s)]
*  insanity of the soap opera that is becoming opening eyes sacks, because every week, it's three, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=6.32s)]
*  four or five stories. Have you seen what's happened this week? Yeah, of course, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=13.36s)]
*  got to catch the audience up here. Let's catch the audience up on what's happened here. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=18.32s)]
*  This week on General AI Hospital, is Sam Altman's job security in jeopardy? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=21.6s)]
*  Whose data was stolen this time? What did he say? Why isn't he talking about it? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=31.12s)]
*  And with our special guest, will our special guest get her revenge? General AI Hospital, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=38.16s)]
*  brought to you by the drama queens at Open AI. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=45.04s)]
*  That was great. Did you make that? Yeah, that was me. 10 out of 10. That was my idea, but [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=52.0s)]
*  Nick's and Lon's execution. So shout out to Nick Calacanis. You finally landed the plane. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=56.96s)]
*  Broken clocks right twice a day. Took four years. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=62.72s)]
*  That was awesome. Broken clock is right twice a day. The Jason Calacanis story. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=65.84s)]
*  That's my own about it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=69.76s)]
*  But seriously, there was a big drama sacks. I don't know if you saw this, but you couldn't [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=87.68s)]
*  miss it with the Scar Joe. So they made an emergency, it had an emergency meeting, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  got all the developers together and they've reset. They took Scarlett Johansson out and they got a [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=97.76s)]
*  new person. I think arguably better. I'm free, but I'm curious your take on this. It's a better. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=101.92s)]
*  Hey, Judge, how's it going? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  Good. Good. Yeah, good. What's going on? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=108.56s)]
*  I'm doing fine. I'm going to be a father real soon. And I think I can have your help with some [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=111.04s)]
*  dad jokes. I'm going to tell you a joke and you tell me if it passes as a dad joke. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=116.4s)]
*  I've never done that before. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=123.36000000000001s)]
*  All right. What do you call a giant pile of kittens? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=124.96s)]
*  Give it to me. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=129.12s)]
*  A mountain. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  No, it doesn't quite land. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=133.68s)]
*  All right. There it is, folks. If you want, you can switch to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=135.44s)]
*  Saxie Poo. So just go into OpenAI. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=139.12s)]
*  You're saying they stole my voice now? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=140.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, they stole yours. Go into OpenAI, go to voices and then just pick Saxie Poo. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=142.4s)]
*  It's right there between Putin and Tucker. Putin, Saxie Poo, Tucker. You can find all [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  your favorite MAGA guests on the number one MAGA program. All in podcast. Here we go. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=154.16s)]
*  All right. We're off to a strong start here. Everybody's in a good mood. Let's keep the good [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=160.96s)]
*  times rolling here and let's go over the ScarJo saga. To recap, if you're living under a rock, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=165.28s)]
*  this week it came out that OpenAI, specifically Sam, had contacted Scarlett Johansson multiple [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  times about lending her voice for one of OpenAI's chat box. Obviously, you know, she famously was [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=178.0s)]
*  the voice Samantha in the awesome film Her. And according to ScarJo, Altman told her she could, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=183.92s)]
*  quote, bridge the gap between tech companies and creatives and help consumers to feel comfortable [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  with the seismic shift concerning humans and AI and that her voice, quote, would be comforting [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=196.48s)]
*  people. Although she declined the offer, OpenAI released a chat bot named Sky, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  which had a similar voice to ScarJo's. According to ScarJo, her friends and family [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=207.67999999999998s)]
*  thought the voice was her. She released a statement, yada yada. On May 13, the day OpenAI [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=211.92s)]
*  launched chat GPT-4-0 Omni, which we talked about last week, Altman tweeted her a reference to the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=216.72s)]
*  film. Obviously, now ScarJo is threatening legal action against OpenAI. Altman put out a statement [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=223.27999999999997s)]
*  apologizing and saying the voice was never intended to resemble hers. His quote, we're sorry to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=229.11999999999998s)]
*  Mr. Johansson that we didn't communicate better. OpenAI showed documents to the Washington Post [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  that confirm the voice was provided by a different actress who is anonymous. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=241.2s)]
*  Post reporters also spoke to the unnamed actress's agent who confirmed the story. I guess, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=244.64s)]
*  Sax, you sent us a comparison clip. Maybe we start there and see what we think. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Do you guys think they sound the same? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  I can understand and generate human-like text pretty well. It really depends on what you're [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=257.03999999999996s)]
*  looking for in an assistant. What specific tasks? When I was like, oh, sexuality, like, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=262.4s)]
*  like, open my eyes to like some other thing. Samantha. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  Where'd you get that name from? I gave it to myself, actually. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  What do you mean? I think it sounds pretty darn similar. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=279.84s)]
*  Dead on. I mean, I don't know if it's dead on. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=283.12s)]
*  Honestly, it sounds like a digitally altered version of her voice. That's what it sounds like. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=286.55999999999995s)]
*  They didn't get it perfect, right? Like they got it to what? 90%? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=291.67999999999995s)]
*  90%? It sounds like it was her voice, but then they changed it. So either that or they hired [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=294.72s)]
*  a voice actor who sounds like her. And that's what the company has said is that they hired a [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  voice actor, but they won't tell us who the voice actor is. They said because of privacy concerns, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  which doesn't quite make sense to me because when you hire an actor, they want the credit. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  So get more work. The company could just clear this whole [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  thing up by saying exactly who the voice actor is. And why wouldn't the voice actor want that? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=323.04s)]
*  You know, what does she doesn't exist? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=329.6s)]
*  Wait, they made this actress up. I mean, she doesn't exist. Of course, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=339.12s)]
*  it's a digitally altered version of Scar Joe. And they got caught. Okay, cookie jar. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=344.48s)]
*  This is why Sam's Paul to Scarlett's agents or her two days before they launched [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=350.32s)]
*  is such a damning piece of evidence because it sounds like he's trying to shut the barn door [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=357.44s)]
*  on something they've already done, right? They've got this demo ready. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=361.84s)]
*  They're going to launch it in two days. They're realizing maybe they don't have the rights to [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=365.44s)]
*  use her voice. So you have to contact her to get those rights. But anyone who knows anything about [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=369.52s)]
*  Hollywood knows you're not going to be able to make a deal with a major star to use her name [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=376.48s)]
*  and likeness in two days. It's impossible. So this seems like a really crazy thing to do. I mean, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  I think the mere fact that he contacted them and then tweeted out her, which shows that Scarlett [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=385.92s)]
*  was on the brain. Those are really damning pieces of evidence, I think, in this lawsuit. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=392.24s)]
*  And I think it's going to feed into her case. Look, here's the thing. This company is going to [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=397.12s)]
*  go down in the history books. In one part because the technical inventions that they've created are [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=401.36s)]
*  just next level and frankly created an entire industry. And I think they deserve a ton of [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=408.48s)]
*  credit for that. But they're also going to be written into the history books for two other [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=413.52000000000004s)]
*  things that are probably less aspirational. I think the first is that there's just all kinds of [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=418.08000000000004s)]
*  dust-ups and unnecessary drama that just seem to kick around every few weeks or months. And then [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=427.28s)]
*  the second is the sheer quantum of value capture that the employees have seen through secondaries [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=433.52s)]
*  before a fully functional business has been really created. And so I think it explains why folks [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  circle the wagons consistently. I think it's a very rational organization. They're technically [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=447.52s)]
*  ahead of everybody else. A lot of people want to put in money at crazy prices. A bunch of that [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=452.64s)]
*  value is transferred immediately to the employees who circle the wagons and do what's necessary to [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=459.44s)]
*  keep the taps flowing. And I think that that explains the whole thing. And I think that that [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=465.68s)]
*  explains many Silicon Valley companies, quite honestly. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=469.91999999999996s)]
*  Aaron Ross Circle the wagons, defend the company, sell your shares in secondary at $90 billion to [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=472.88s)]
*  thrive or whoever. What would your take free Berg on all of this craziness and drama? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=478.08s)]
*  I think what we will see over time is that rather than have the ability to sue for their likeness, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=483.52s)]
*  a lot of AI that is like a celebrity, the value of it will arise from the celebrities endorsement, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=493.52s)]
*  not actually using the celebrities features. So without the endorsement, I know everyone kind of [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=501.36s)]
*  wants to point to this idea of likeness. But I think that there's something about the authentic [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=507.28s)]
*  aspect of having the celebrity actually endorse and provide their signature or their stamp on it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=511.59999999999997s)]
*  Restaurants are a good example. Some celebrity chef says I was involved in making this menu. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=517.8399999999999s)]
*  That's a lot different than mimicking the celebrity chef's menu from his restaurant, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=522.0799999999999s)]
*  putting his or her name and brand on it. There's a bunch of videos on YouTube now. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=526.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you guys ever, you guys probably don't watch these, but I love watching these [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=530.0799999999999s)]
*  videos where music producers make tracks and how they do it. And so many of these producers now are [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=533.12s)]
*  using AI tools, taking samples off of old records or other tracks and then telling the AI make [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=538.5600000000001s)]
*  something that sounds like this or looks like this, but isn't like this. And so there's enough [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=545.04s)]
*  of a transformation happening that it isn't a direct likeness. And then they're able to create [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=549.52s)]
*  entire vocal tracks without needing a singer or without needing the celebrity singer. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=554.32s)]
*  You're in the much ado about nothing on this card. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=559.52s)]
*  I'm in the like, the content itself, I think is probably less compelling. Oh, you go after her [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=562.0s)]
*  because the voice sounds the same. But I do think that there's this element of like, what if you [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=568.48s)]
*  could then say, Hey, you know, Britney Spears actually lent her voice to this track. So do you [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=573.0400000000001s)]
*  think if she sues open AI, do you think it should just get thrown out? It's not a real case. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=577.6s)]
*  No, I think there's probably going to be a lot of discovery to Sax's point that's going to show [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=582.88s)]
*  that they probably did. Yeah, the discovery is going to be juicy. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=586.1600000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, I'm not. I'm not saying that I'm saying I'm asking you more that, yeah, even if [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=589.3599999999999s)]
*  they find it, your point is it shouldn't matter. My point is, do you think that it should be thrown [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=593.04s)]
*  out? Well, I don't know. I mean, hold on. Let's say you're casting a movie and you know, you can't [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=596.9599999999999s)]
*  get Scarlett Johansson for it. And so you tell the casting director, get me a Scarlett Johansson type. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=601.12s)]
*  I think you can do that. Okay, obviously, you can't you can't use her name, you can't use her [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=604.8s)]
*  likeness, but you could hire a different actor who might look or sound like Scarlett Johansson. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=609.52s)]
*  If the company actually did that, and they did it nine months ago, this is what the statement [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=614.8s)]
*  they put out. I think they've got a decent defense. Yeah, but because they may have done, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=619.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't know if we believe that. I mean, again, why why don't you just put out the name of the [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  actual actor that voice actor that you used? And there's a very simple test here. If the person [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=630.0s)]
*  if there's confusion amongst the public, which is what Scar Jo put in her letter, and that was a [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=635.12s)]
*  legally written, deftly written letter to set up a huge settlement. Because she said, the morning [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=640.88s)]
*  this came out, all of my friends said, Oh, my God, congratulations on your chat GPT, you know, this [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=646.56s)]
*  is great. The public being confused is the key issue here. And there's something called the right [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=652.24s)]
*  to publicity. This is basically how celebrities defend their rights. It's happening all the time [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=656.96s)]
*  to podcasters, by the way, there was a company that put me in their ads based on something I said in [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=661.52s)]
*  a show. And then they put ads against it. And Huberman's been having this happen, Joe Rogan's [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=665.52s)]
*  happening to me right now. I'm in the middle of this crazy thing with Facebook, and they've been [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=671.04s)]
*  doing a very good job, the team at Metta, Ashley, thank you, but hundreds and hundreds and hundreds [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=675.92s)]
*  of automated accounts, pretending to be me, selling all kinds of random stuff. It's predominantly on [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=680.72s)]
*  WhatsApp and Facebook and Metta. And I don't know what to do, because I, we work together with them, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=686.3199999999999s)]
*  we shut it down. I've actually had to reactivate my Facebook and Instagram accounts, which were [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=692.24s)]
*  dormant, so that we could actually have them be verified, so that then it's easier to shut them [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=696.88s)]
*  down. But it is an impossible task when somebody is impersonating you to fight it. At least in my [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=702.56s)]
*  experience, it's been a month and we it's just like every hundred we take down, it's another [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=709.04s)]
*  thousand. In both of those cases, you guys have your exact image of you being shown to sell to [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=712.8s)]
*  sell stuff. I think that in this case, it's also unique to Scar Joe, because she was the voice from [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=718.88s)]
*  her. There is no like if this were like a voice sort of like Cameron Diaz or sort of like Julia [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=724.32s)]
*  Roberts, it wouldn't be as big a deal, because it would certainly got some differences to it. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=729.0400000000001s)]
*  But it's because they're trying to mimic the movie her. Well, didn't Metta use Morgan Freeman when [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=733.6800000000001s)]
*  like, Zuck created like an AI or something as a project? You guys remember that? Wasn't Morgan [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=738.6400000000001s)]
*  Freeman the voice? They paid for it. And there's a company speechify. I'm not an investor or anything [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=742.48s)]
*  like that. But they have Gwyneth Paltrow as a licensed voice to read your stuff. So they should [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=747.6s)]
*  just license Gwyneth's voice. Obviously, obvious, like just whoever wants to get paid. Here's the [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=753.36s)]
*  opportunity if three people say no, the fact that they're not trying to say this is this person's [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=759.76s)]
*  voice, but they want to say like, Hey, let's say you just can prompt the AI and say generate a voice [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=764.4s)]
*  that is sort of like movies that are comfortable and calming to people to listen to. And you know, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=769.92s)]
*  that we've that we think people will be comfortable and the AI generates something that sounds like [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=775.6s)]
*  this before, but it's not the literally trained on star using a computer to probabilistically [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=780.0s)]
*  copy something is still copying something. Yes. Come on, guys, let's not make this too complicated. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=784.8s)]
*  Is the public confused is the only test you need for you. What if there's two public actresses [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=789.1999999999999s)]
*  that both have similar voices and then they both claim, Hey, you tried to make this sound like me. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=793.68s)]
*  What do you do in that case tomorrow? Well, which one did you call two days before the demo? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=797.92s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. And did the CEO tweet? I think your whole point about discovery is what is going to [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=801.68s)]
*  get them in trouble in this case because they were clearly they were clearly trying to do an [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=806.4s)]
*  impersonation of her, right? Yeah. If they never reached out to scarlet, they could claim it's just [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=810.4s)]
*  a coincidence, but they called her twice. They called her some months before and then two days [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=816.3199999999999s)]
*  before, which indicates panic. Judge sacks. Give your verdict. I'm starting a new show. Judge sacks [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=821.4399999999999s)]
*  says guilty. Okay. Sentence now. What's the sentence? The sentence is that scarlet [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=827.12s)]
*  Johans is going to end up owning more of this company than Sam Altman. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=836.32s)]
*  They call her two days before. Why do you do that? Guilty because you know, you have a problem [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=845.6800000000001s)]
*  and you're trying to put the horse back in the barn. They should have done [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=850.6400000000001s)]
*  is as soon as she says no, you just change the voice completely. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=854.24s)]
*  Or you get a fixer, get Michael Cohen in there and get a settlement going. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=858.24s)]
*  Let's get some fixer in there to fix it. Okay, listen enough with open AI. Oh, wait, there's more. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=861.7600000000001s)]
*  Geez, is ruining the docket. I guess we have to talk about the next drama from a open AI this week. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=869.2s)]
*  Former employees sign an agreement that they're forbidden forever from criticizing the company [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=877.6800000000001s)]
*  or even acknowledging that the NDA exists. If a departing employee declines to sign the document, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=883.12s)]
*  or if they violate it, they can lose all vested equity they earned during their time at the [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=888.32s)]
*  company in practice. This means ex-employees have to choose between giving up millions of dollars [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=893.44s)]
*  they've already earned or agreeing not to criticize the company in perpetuity. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=897.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, you can see why they wrote that in there. That makes sense if you think, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=906.72s)]
*  hold on a second, if an employee can leave with, you know, a random copy of like some old weights [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=909.6s)]
*  as a starting point to rebuild the model that could be very valuable or there's all kinds of [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=916.56s)]
*  Yeah, but there's all kinds of like, kind of quasi confidential information or knowledge or know how [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=922.16s)]
*  that you leave a place like that with so I could see why there was a justification to [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=928.64s)]
*  be very heavy handed about it. But again, the question isn't whether you're allowed to be [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=936.8s)]
*  heavy handed. You are. The question is why backtrack and then obfuscate and lie after you get caught? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=941.76s)]
*  They claim it's an accident. Once they get caught with their hand in the cookie jar, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=949.84s)]
*  which like you said, your mouth is just a heavy handed agreement. It's in the company's interest [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=953.76s)]
*  to do this. They just say it was an accident, just like the Scarlet thing is an accident or [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=957.04s)]
*  a coincidence. It's just getting hard to believe. Just own it and say, you know what, guys, this is [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=961.28s)]
*  a really valuable company. There's a ton of very valuable trade secret know how IP confidential [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=965.4399999999999s)]
*  information and we're going to be extremely litigious on the offense and protect it because [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=970.16s)]
*  our and it's correlated to the importance of the company ecosystem. You could have said that and [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=976.56s)]
*  people could have been upset, but they would have understood. Here's what Sam Altman said. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=981.04s)]
*  There was a provision about potential equity cancellation in our previous exit docs, although [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=984.9599999999999s)]
*  we never clawed anything back. It should never have been something we had in any documents [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=990.4s)]
*  or communication. This is on me and one of the few times I've genuinely [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=995.68s)]
*  been embarrassed running open. I did not know this was happening and I should have. If any [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1001.68s)]
*  former employee who signed one of these old agreements is worried about it, they can contact [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1007.3599999999999s)]
*  me and we'll fix that too. Very sorry about this. So he's very, very sorry. It's starting to be like [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1010.8s)]
*  BP oil. This company, like they're just so sorry about everything. Here's the question is these [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1015.92s)]
*  are form documents at the end of the day and form documents don't write themselves. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1022.08s)]
*  Lawyers write them and when you get a novel change in one of these documents, somebody thought that [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1027.3600000000001s)]
*  through and thought it'd be a good idea and put it in there. Right. And like Jamal said, there is a [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1031.76s)]
*  way to potentially defend that. It's not like these provisions don't exist. It's just a novel [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1037.1200000000001s)]
*  application to try and claw back someone's already vested equity from a company on behalf of these [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1041.52s)]
*  things. Yeah, that is not exactly standard. Sometimes that's completely non-standard. I'm [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1047.2s)]
*  just saying that these provisions exist in other contexts and their application as a clawback of [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1051.8400000000001s)]
*  vested employee equity is something that I don't think any of us have heard before. So I haven't. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1057.92s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So my point is just, this didn't happen as an accident. Somebody made a [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1062.96s)]
*  strategic business decision to do this because they thought it'd be in the company's interest. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1068.0s)]
*  Yeah. So just in layman's terms, the clawback means you had 10 million in equity [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1071.92s)]
*  you earn 75% of it. You've got 7.5 million in equity there. You say something disparaging [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1077.6000000000001s)]
*  about the company. They can take it back from you. Once you leave a company and you vested equity, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1082.8s)]
*  you don't lose it. I mean, as long as you have some period in which to exercise your option, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1090.8s)]
*  if it's an option rather than stock. But other than that, I've never heard of a situation where [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1095.68s)]
*  employees can lose their vested equity. Even in a situation, Sacks, we've seen this, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1101.2s)]
*  where somebody commits fraud. They still get their vested equity and then it's up to the [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1105.36s)]
*  company to sue them for fraud separately. Right? Like we've seen, I guess that's right. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1110.24s)]
*  I mean, I guess that's right. Like committing a crime. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1114.56s)]
*  Look, I think the question here is, is it credible that they keep having these accidents [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1117.4399999999998s)]
*  and coincidences? What does judge Sacks say? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1123.36s)]
*  Judge Sacks says there's one too many coincidences. Look, I think like Jemah said, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1127.84s)]
*  you could have just owned this and said that, defended in the way he said and said, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1133.84s)]
*  but you know what? It was too aggressive and we pulled it back. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1138.24s)]
*  I think the thing is, look, if you think about the pendulum of culture in Silicon Valley, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1140.32s)]
*  we used to have a very tough culture of founder led businesses where there was extremely high [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1145.9199999999998s)]
*  expectations. And if you transgressed, it was very punitive. And then the pendulum swung in the, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1154.1599999999999s)]
*  all the way to the other opposite end where you had this like coddling daycare type approach [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1162.0s)]
*  that existed for like the last 15 or 20 years. And probably what open AI is, is an example of a [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1167.04s)]
*  company that needs to be run a little bit more like the former, but stuck with a bunch of people [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1172.16s)]
*  that still pull it towards to be the latter. And that's the cultural tension that they're [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1178.64s)]
*  going to have to sort out because in order to be this incredible bastion of like AGI and innovation, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1182.96s)]
*  I suspect that it's going to look more like a three letter agency in terms of security and [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1189.44s)]
*  protocols in the next five or 10 years than it is going to look like the Googleplex. And I think [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1194.48s)]
*  they just need to own that. And this is probably a little bit of an insight into that tension. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1199.28s)]
*  And they're going to have to go in more in that direction. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1204.3200000000002s)]
*  I think it's a good insight. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1206.4s)]
*  You're not going to be allowed to build these incredibly crazy world beating technologies where [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1207.1200000000001s)]
*  people are running around in an eight seater bicycle. It's just not going to work. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1212.24s)]
*  And by the way, I mean, because it is such an industry leading company, I think we could end [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1216.24s)]
*  up with some very bad fair use precedents or laws because Scarlett Johansson is so sympathetic [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1220.96s)]
*  as a plaintiff compared to open AI. And it's, you know, unless they show us some discovery [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1228.16s)]
*  that proves that they really did hire the voice actor and all the rest of it. I mean, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1235.92s)]
*  this could lead to some very bad precedents for the industry around fair use. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1240.16s)]
*  Well, and here we go. I think the Microsoft will pay the speeding ticket and we'll just all move [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1244.24s)]
*  on. But Freeberg, my God, can you imagine like being two or three PhDs and, you know, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1248.5600000000002s)]
*  machine learning or whatever you study your whole life, you're pursuing general AI and like people [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1255.1200000000001s)]
*  are coming up to your desk and creating all this drama and nonsense. And you're in the middle of [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1259.6000000000001s)]
*  a soap opera while you're trying to create the technology that creates super intelligence. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1263.8400000000001s)]
*  It's nuts. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1268.24s)]
*  Yeah, I find it annoying to just listening to it. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1269.92s)]
*  Okay, well, then in that case, we will move on from open AI up. Sorry. There's one more drama [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1272.64s)]
*  going on. It's not just drama. I mean, it's there's now a lawsuit. I think I think it's a [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1279.28s)]
*  very interesting case. The fair use case is interesting. I think it's a legitimately [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1283.8400000000001s)]
*  interesting case that's gonna if it goes all the way is if it goes the distance, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1287.68s)]
*  it's going to create some really interesting precedents. Well, I mean, you [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1292.4s)]
*  know, this is already but yeah, these the what happens in these content cases is they get [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1295.8400000000001s)]
*  settled almost every single time. So the case law doesn't get codified. They just get settled out of [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1300.4s)]
*  court. You go look at all the fair use cases. They almost never go to the mat. And so this one will [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1305.8400000000001s)]
*  just be settled. It'll just be a question. I think the other the interesting part of the other story [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1311.6000000000001s)]
*  is that the reason all this stuff came out about the equity clawbacks was because the safety team [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1316.72s)]
*  quit and it got leaked during that process. So this is the third dramatic story of the week [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1321.2s)]
*  that will go on. That one I think begs a little bit more of a question of [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1325.44s)]
*  Yeah, two heads of open eyes super alignment team left the company last week, the day after [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1330.88s)]
*  GPT for a launch. Ilja announced he was leaving the company. He was our chief scientist a few [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1338.64s)]
*  hours later, his partner on the alignment team, Jan Leica also announced he was resigning in a [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1344.96s)]
*  later thread like explained that he left due to quote, safety culture and processes have taken a [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1351.68s)]
*  backseat to shiny products. Okay, there's a little bit of disparagement to our former point about [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1358.8s)]
*  non disparaging non D and NDAs. So API open AI lost both its heads of AI alignment. One day after [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1365.68s)]
*  it launched that new product is that a coincidence? It's interesting. If you don't know what super [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1374.32s)]
*  alignment is, it's basically making sure that the software doesn't go Terminator. What are your [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1379.6799999999998s)]
*  thoughts on this free bird? I don't know. I mean, it could be some bad bureaucracy, bad politicking, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1385.9199999999998s)]
*  not being listened to. But I think the real interesting question is, who's going to ask these [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1394.8799999999999s)]
*  guys? What's really going on from a technology perspective? And what is that going to reveal? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1401.6s)]
*  Because these guys clearly are on the frontier of model development and the performance of models. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1408.0s)]
*  And so my guess is, there are certain regulatory people who are going to have interest in the fact [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1413.92s)]
*  that this team just left, they're going to make a phone call, they're gonna ask this team to come [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1419.68s)]
*  in and have a conversation. And they're going to start to ask a lot of questions about what the [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1423.2s)]
*  state of technology is over there. And I suspect that some things are going to start to come out. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1427.04s)]
*  Sacks, it was reported that Ilya was on the side of the non-profit, the Slow Down AI, Be Cautious [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1431.6s)]
*  group when they fired Sam. So what's your take on what's going on here with super alignment inside [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1442.8s)]
*  of OpenAI? Judge Sacks. Let's call this what it is, a mass resignation. And we don't really know why. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1449.2s)]
*  I mean, apparently they were promised something like 20% of the computing resources of OpenAI. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1456.0s)]
*  And they didn't get that. I definitely read that somewhere. And so that is part of it, I think, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1461.84s)]
*  but we don't really know the whole story. And you know, when you look at this issue of the mass [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1468.4s)]
*  rising nation, and then you look at the issue of the clawback of vested employee equity, you're [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1474.6399999999999s)]
*  like, well, wait a second, maybe they felt like they needed that clawback in order to deter all [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1480.56s)]
*  these people who are leaving from spilling the beans about right, whatever was upsetting them. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1486.24s)]
*  So I clearly upset them, right? Yeah. That's why people are saying there's this meme. What did [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1491.68s)]
*  Ilya see? What did he see? And then like you said, the board did fire him. And the only explanation [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1495.84s)]
*  they provided was that he wasn't being candid for, which at the time we thought was an incredibly [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1500.96s)]
*  damning statement. And we thought we'd get some explanation of it. We never got any explanation [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1506.32s)]
*  whatsoever. You know, I thought that the board was being incompetent because I thought that either [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1511.2s)]
*  they fired him overly hastily, or they had reason to fire him, but then they communicated poorly. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1516.24s)]
*  And, you know, is you add all these things up, and it definitely seems like smoke. Sam's a straight [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1522.08s)]
*  shooter. We should just have him on the pod to explain. Clear everything up. Stop me if you [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1528.4s)]
*  heard this before. Nvidia Nvidia just smashed all expectations while reporting record profits and [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1536.08s)]
*  revenue. The AI train continues on Wednesday. Nvidia reported earnings for the fiscal q1. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1541.28s)]
*  Revenue was 26 billion up 18% quarter per quarter, 260% year over year, basically they [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1547.28s)]
*  quadrupled year over year on billions of revenue. This chart is bonkers. We've never seen anything [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1553.6s)]
*  like this in the history of Silicon Valley or corporate America. This is if somebody, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1560.08s)]
*  like literally was mining coal and then found a diamond, a gold mine underneath it. It's bonkers [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1565.28s)]
*  what's happened here. When you look at the revenue there, though, you know, sort of slow growth or [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1571.76s)]
*  moderate growth revenue that they experienced that was all because Nvidia was primarily providing [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1577.28s)]
*  GPUs for people playing video games or mining crypto. And then what you see with this unbelievable [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1583.44s)]
*  six quarter run and five, six quarter run is companies like Microsoft, Google, Tesla, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1589.76s)]
*  OpenAI, etc. buying just billions and billions of dollars worth of hardware. I'll end on this and [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1596.72s)]
*  chamoth and get your take on it. Here's 2019 top companies by market cap in the world. Obviously, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1605.44s)]
*  Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google, Berkshire, Facebook, Alibaba, Tencent. And then you get some [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1612.4s)]
*  of the, you know, incumbents and legacy companies, J&J, Exxon, and JP Morgan Visa. Way down on the [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1617.8400000000001s)]
*  list in 2019. Number 84 was Nvidia. Today, Nvidia is the third largest company by market cap behind [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1625.28s)]
*  Microsoft and Apple and ahead of Google, aka, alphabet and Saudi ramco. Chamath, what's your [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1632.64s)]
*  take on this? Will it continue? And how do you conceptualize this level of growth on such a big [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1640.8000000000002s)]
*  number? I mean, I think it's a really, really incredibly fun moment if you're in [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1648.16s)]
*  involved in anything AI related, just because it shows the level of investment that [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1655.3600000000001s)]
*  Nvidia's customers are making into making this new reality available for everybody. Right? So when [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1661.44s)]
*  you're spending effectively $100 billion a year on the CapEx of chips, and then a couple hundred [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1670.4s)]
*  billion more on all the related infrastructure, and then another couple hundred billion more [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1675.76s)]
*  on power, you're talking about half a trillion to three quarters of a trillion dollars a year [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1681.1200000000001s)]
*  being spent to bring AI forward to the masses. So I think that's the really positive [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1687.44s)]
*  take. The other exciting thing is, if you're on the other side of the Nvidia trade, which is [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1692.24s)]
*  you're working on something that does what they do, cheaper, faster or better. It's also really [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1698.24s)]
*  exciting because at some point, the laws of capitalism kick in, right? We've talked about [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1705.68s)]
*  this when you are over earning so massively, the rational thing to do for other actors in the arena [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1709.6s)]
*  is to come and attack that margin and give it to people for slightly cheaper, slightly faster, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1716.24s)]
*  slightly better so you can take share. Yes. So I think what you're seeing and what you'll see [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1722.24s)]
*  even more now is this incentive for Silicon Valley, who has been really reticent to put money into [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1727.12s)]
*  chips, really reticent to put money into hardware, they're going to get pulled into investing in this [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1732.24s)]
*  space because there's no choice. You have a company that went from 100 billion a market cap [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1738.32s)]
*  to two and a half trillion in four years. It's just too much value that is there to then be leaked [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1743.52s)]
*  back. The interesting thing to remember, during the PC revolution, which is really mostly the 90s, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1750.8s)]
*  it ended in the late 90s, I would say like 98, 99, right before the dot-com bubble took over, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1757.12s)]
*  Intel's peak market cap was, I think it got to about $200 billion. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1762.24s)]
*  And then their average growth rate from 1998 to today was negative 1.4% a year, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1767.36s)]
*  right? So it went from about 200 billion to about 130 odd billion. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1774.6399999999999s)]
*  And why? It's not that Intel was a worst company, but it's that everything else caught up. And the [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1779.04s)]
*  economic value went to things that sat above them in the stack. Then it went to Cisco for a while. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1785.9199999999998s)]
*  Then after Cisco, it went to the browser companies for a little bit. Then it went to the app [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1792.3999999999999s)]
*  companies. Then it went to the device companies. Then it went to the mobile companies. So [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1796.8799999999999s)]
*  you see this natural tendency for value to push up the stack over time. And in AI, we've done step [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1801.1999999999998s)]
*  one, which is now you've given all this value to Nvidia, and now we're going to see it being [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1808.6399999999999s)]
*  reallocated. So Jamath, who's in the arena trying some of these things working? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1812.9599999999998s)]
*  Everybody's not working. So right now, what you do is you speculatively bet on anything that [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1818.08s)]
*  rhymes with Nvidia. So AMD is ripping, the companies that make, HPM is ripping. So all of that [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1825.6799999999998s)]
*  stuff, the folks that make optical cables, this Japanese company that I found that makes the [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1833.6799999999998s)]
*  high bandwidth optical cables ripping. So anything related to that ecosystem right now [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1838.7199999999998s)]
*  is at all time highs. But at the same time, what you find now is like every other day when you wake [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1845.28s)]
*  up and read the trades in Techland, you find that there's a company that's gotten seeded [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1851.68s)]
*  with five to 50 million bucks to create a new chip. You're also starting to see folks that are [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1857.6s)]
*  working a little bit above the stack and build better compilers, things that'll allow you to [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1862.96s)]
*  actually build once run in many different compute environments. So all of this stuff is starting to [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1868.32s)]
*  happen. At some point, the spread trade will be that Nvidia loses share, even though revenues keep [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1875.36s)]
*  compounding to these upstarts. Yeah, death by 1000 startups. All right, I guess one of the questions [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1882.56s)]
*  people are asking right now is, have we ever seen a company at this scale and the impact it's having, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1889.6799999999998s)]
*  not just in technology, which Trimof just pointed out beautifully, but also it's having a huge impact [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1895.84s)]
*  on Wall Street, on the stock market, on finance? Well, the company that everyone compares Nvidia to [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1900.3999999999999s)]
*  or asked the question about whether a historical comparison should be made is Cisco. So there's an [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1910.08s)]
*  article in Motley Fool saying is Nvidia doomed to be the next Cisco? There was one in Morningstar [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1915.6s)]
*  called Nvidia 2023 versus Cisco 1999. Will history repeat itself? The reason they're asking [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1922.4s)]
*  these questions is that if you go back to the dot com boom in 1999, to pull up the stock performance [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1927.68s)]
*  chart, you can see that Cisco had this incredible run. And if you overlay the stock price of Nvidia, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1935.44s)]
*  it seems to be following that same trajectory. And what happened with Cisco is that when the [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1944.0800000000002s)]
*  dot com crash came in 2000, Cisco stock lost a huge part of its value. Obviously, Cisco is still [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1948.0s)]
*  around today and it's a valuable company, but it just hasn't ever regained the type of market cap [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1952.8s)]
*  it had. The reason this happened is because Cisco got commoditized. So to Trimof's point, the success [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1957.76s)]
*  and market cap of that company attracted a whole bunch of new entrants and they copied Cisco's [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1963.68s)]
*  products until they were total commodities. So the question is, will that happen to Nvidia? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1967.84s)]
*  And I think the difference here is that at the end of the day, networking equipment, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1973.68s)]
*  which Cisco produced was pretty easy. Pretty one dimensional. Pretty easy to copy. Moving data around. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1978.64s)]
*  Whereas if you look at Nvidia, these GPU cores are really complicated to make. And [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1985.2s)]
*  Jensen makes it this point that the H100, for example, has thousands of components and it [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1991.76s)]
*  weighs like 70 pounds or something like that. I mean, it's like a giant oven. I mean, it's like [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=1998.32s)]
*  a frame frame. It's not just like a little chip. So it's a much more complicated product to copy. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2002.6399999999999s)]
*  And then on top of that, they're already in the R&D cycle for the next chip, right? Well, whatever [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2008.32s)]
*  is going to be the H200 or whatever it is. And so as people try to catch up with H100, they're going [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2013.28s)]
*  to be onto H200. So I think you can make the case that Nvidia has a much better moat than Cisco. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2019.6s)]
*  And just by the way, on this Cisco comparison, just to finish the thought, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2026.16s)]
*  people were making this comparison six months ago. And what's happened since then? Nvidia's had two [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2030.16s)]
*  block orders and the competitors don't seem to be that much closer. Maybe a little bit closer, but [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2035.1200000000001s)]
*  so, you know, look, I think it's an open question. So there's a counter here, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2040.64s)]
*  Freeberg, which is obviously if you follow the Cisco analogy, one of the things that also [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2044.72s)]
*  sunk Cisco was once people had bought all that capacity, there was no need, there was no [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2050.56s)]
*  file size that was so great that it couldn't be moved easily around the internet. You know, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2056.0s)]
*  you make movies HD, super HD, 2K, 4K, the bet we've created too much bandwidth, there was no use [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2061.04s)]
*  for it. So I guess that that's a counter argument for maybe when, if we build up too much capacity, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2068.4s)]
*  Nvidia also could not by competitors, but just by the build out being enough. So what's your take [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2073.92s)]
*  on that counter argument and then whatever I thought you have? I think that the Cisco analogy, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2079.36s)]
*  it's a pretty different situation because Cisco evolved the business to become much more enterprise [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2084.08s)]
*  centric. And they were able to run an M&A process like we see with enterprise software, where they [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2088.32s)]
*  could acquire and roll up lots of different product companies and sell into their enterprise [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2095.1200000000003s)]
*  channels. So do a lot of cross selling. Nvidia is not a super acquisitive business. And it doesn't [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2100.8s)]
*  make as much sense because they're selling much more kind of infrastructure tools, whereas Cisco [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2105.92s)]
*  moved really high up in the enterprise stack. They were selling stuff into office buildings, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2110.2400000000002s)]
*  they were selling software, they did acquisitions to kind of fully integrate. They had a very diverse [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2115.6s)]
*  set of products that were selling through an enterprise channel, further up the value stack [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2120.32s)]
*  and a pretty distributed customer base, no serious concentration. Even though they did sell a lot into [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2124.7200000000003s)]
*  data centers, they were also selling to telcos, they were selling to enterprises, they were selling [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2129.84s)]
*  to governments and so on. If you look at Nvidia's revenue, they did $26 billion of total revenue in [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2134.0s)]
*  the quarter, $22 billion of which was data center. And about 40% of that was from the top four [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2138.48s)]
*  hyperscalers. So a full one third of Nvidia's revenue in the quarter came from, I believe it's [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2145.12s)]
*  Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta. And so between those four businesses, you know that those [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2151.04s)]
*  companies each have, I believe, at least over or close to $100 billion of cash sitting on their [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2157.76s)]
*  balance sheet. They can't find great places to invest that cash to grow revenue. And so they've [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2163.92s)]
*  rationalized away the idea that they will make capex investments to build over the next five to [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2168.96s)]
*  10 years. And this is where that money flows. Yeah, we talked about that in a previous episode, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2173.04s)]
*  because there's no M&A to your point. You can't let you buy stuff where the UK is not going to [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2176.96s)]
*  let you buy stuff. So I think that they're going to have less maneuvering capability than Cisco had [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2181.2000000000003s)]
*  in the future. And obviously, there's this deep concentration risk, which is going to be deeply [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2186.7200000000003s)]
*  challenging. I think Nvidia, this is to build on Sachs's point, is going to get pulled into [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2190.48s)]
*  competing directly with the hyperscalers. So if you were just selling chips, you probably wouldn't. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2196.0s)]
*  But Sachs is right. Like these are these big, bulky, actual machines. Then all of a sudden, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2202.16s)]
*  you're like, well, why don't I just create my own physical plant and just stack these things and [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2208.56s)]
*  create racks and racks of these machines. And go on to have AWS instead of selling to them. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2213.28s)]
*  It's not a far stretch, especially because Nvidia actually has the software interface that everybody [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2218.0s)]
*  uses, which is CUDA. So I think it's likely that Nvidia goes on a full frontal assault against [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2224.24s)]
*  GCP and Amazon and Microsoft. That's going to really complicate the relationship that those [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2230.4s)]
*  folks have with each other. But I think it's inevitable because you're getting how do you [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2236.24s)]
*  defend it's kind of the Apple problem. How do you defend an enormously large market cap, you're [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2240.4s)]
*  forced to go into businesses that are equally lucrative. Now, if I look inside of compute, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2246.4s)]
*  and look at the adjacent categories, they're not going to all of a sudden start a competitor to [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2252.8s)]
*  TikTok, right, or a social network. But if you look at the multi hundred billion revenue businesses [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2256.7200000000003s)]
*  that are adjacent to the markets that Nvidia enables, the most obvious one is the hyperscalers, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2262.32s)]
*  which are multi hundred billion dollar revenue businesses. So they're going to be forced to [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2267.28s)]
*  compete. Otherwise, their market cap will shrink. And I don't think they want that. And then it's [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2272.16s)]
*  going to create a very complicated set of incentives for Microsoft and Google and Meta, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2278.08s)]
*  and Apple and all the rest. And that's also then going to be an accelerant, they're going to pump [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2284.24s)]
*  so much money to help all of these upstarts, to your point, Jason chip away and nip at the Achilles [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2288.3199999999997s)]
*  heels of Nvidia until they fall. Yeah, and there's a great precedent for what you're saying, because [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2295.7599999999998s)]
*  or clues, Amazon is making chips, Google is making chips, and in fact, Apple, Tesla is making chips, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2301.76s)]
*  yeah, and then Apple, everybody's makes their own chips, and they got rid of Intel. And so this is [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2308.8s)]
*  how it's going to go. Your margin is my opportunity. And you know, with all this market cap increase, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2313.92s)]
*  the good news is just reported that Jensen has bought a second leather jacket. So well, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2319.44s)]
*  this market cap has enabled him to expand the water. I gotta say, he looks really good. He [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2324.2400000000002s)]
*  looks super fit. Great. You know, he just like picture. Is he is in his late 50s. He's going [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2329.68s)]
*  into his Harrison Ford looks great. The salt and pepper 61. 61. He looks amazing. He looks amazing. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2335.12s)]
*  I'll tell you something in the zombie apocalypse draft. I'm picking him. That guy seems crafty, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2344.56s)]
*  you know, like, what do you think he does for exercise? No plastic ball, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2349.04s)]
*  plastic, no, no, no, no, his balls have plastic. No, no, he's got his have brass. He's literally [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2354.64s)]
*  had brass put into his balls. All of our balls have plastic, apparently. Okay, well, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2361.84s)]
*  we have two choices here. We can go with another tech story or we can go directly to science corner [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2367.2799999999997s)]
*  and you know, I think you should do state of the economy and then do science corner. Okay, so you [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2372.72s)]
*  want to talk about our pocket books and then we'll talk about our pockets and then we'll just make a [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2376.16s)]
*  quick detour to the right and then talk about our balls in the same vicinity. So there was [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2380.4s)]
*  our balls. Okay, great. Yeah, let's let's end with our balls. That's science. I mean, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2384.8s)]
*  he likes to start with the balls. I don't know, everybody's got different kind of vibes here. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2389.6800000000003s)]
*  The ballplay should come a little bit later in the in the program. You want to save the ballplay for [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2394.7200000000003s)]
*  later, sex. I'm having a hard time keeping this to guys. More than half of Americans think we're in [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2399.12s)]
*  a recession. I think we're in a vibe session right now because we're not in a recession. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2408.64s)]
*  But people are feeling really bad. A Harris poll conducted by the Guardian shows [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2413.36s)]
*  56% of Americans wrongly believe the US is in a recession. Not surprisingly, they blame Biden. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2419.92s)]
*  The poll highlighted a bunch of misconceptions. 55% believe the US economy is shrinking. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2426.0s)]
*  It's obviously not. 56% think the US is experiencing recession. It's obviously not. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2431.92s)]
*  49% of people believe the S&P 500 stock market index is down for the year. It's up 12% this year. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2437.2000000000003s)]
*  It was up 24% in 2023. And 49% believe that unemployment is at a 50 year high when it's in [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2442.88s)]
*  fact at a 50 year low. And Americans are really concerned about the cost of living and inflation. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2449.76s)]
*  Fair enough. 70% said the biggest economic concern was the cost of living. 68% said that inflation [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2456.56s)]
*  was the biggest economic concern. Important quote here, a majority of respondents agreed, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2463.28s)]
*  it's difficult to be happy about positive economic news when I feel financially squeezed each month, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2468.48s)]
*  and that the economy was worse than the media made it out to be. According to the poll, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2473.44s)]
*  70% of Republicans and 40% of Democrats think Biden is making the economy worse. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2477.76s)]
*  Chamath, you have some thoughts on this? I'm going to go out on the limb and speculate that [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2483.92s)]
*  a lot of the big numbers that we use to gauge how we should feel about things [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2489.28s)]
*  in today's day and age are pretty brittle. Okay. Explain brittle here. And fragile and may actually [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2496.2400000000002s)]
*  just be totally wrong. So what's an example? So for example, if you look at something like [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2504.4s)]
*  non-farm payrolls, right? So the first Friday of every month, you get this report that comes out [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2509.52s)]
*  from the Department of Labor and it shows where unemployment is. But how do they calculate that? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2514.56s)]
*  Do you think that they have a real time sense of exactly every person in that month that entered [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2520.88s)]
*  the workforce or exited the workforce? No. They do a survey and then they extrapolate. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2525.12s)]
*  And if you do that survey incorrectly, and Jason, you've commented on this before, for example, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2530.56s)]
*  if you don't capture adequately the number of people that are on the sidelines and never join [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2534.7999999999997s)]
*  the workforce or the number of people that are part of the gig economy, so they are kind of working, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2539.12s)]
*  you get an inaccurate sense of where the real economy is. I think that GDP is somewhat similar, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2544.16s)]
*  because if you just break down what GDP is, so Nick, there's a very simple pie chart I sent to you. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2550.64s)]
*  What is GDP? It's the sum of four things. Most of it is what people spend. Okay. Then the next big [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2556.64s)]
*  chunk is what companies and governments spend. And then the last is what we export to other [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2565.36s)]
*  countries. So let's just pause for one second and think about what do you think happens when rates [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2573.2s)]
*  are zero versus when rates are at 6%? People spend a lot more. Well, people tend to save when [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2577.76s)]
*  interest rates are high. Just the natural thing like why would I buy a pair of these Nike shoes? [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2584.8s)]
*  I'll just put it in the bank, I get 6%. But when the bank pays you zero, you're like, ah, let me [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2589.44s)]
*  buy these Air Force 1s and move on. Right? It turns out it's the same for companies. Companies [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2594.4s)]
*  find it easier to invest when rates are at zero because it's cheaper. It's much more expensive [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2599.5200000000004s)]
*  because they're borrowing money at 6% versus at 0%. Or more corporate gets charged a higher fee. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2604.08s)]
*  Right? Yeah. Then when you have high interest rates, you have a currency that appreciates, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2609.36s)]
*  it makes exports less attractive to other people, which means then you become an importer. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2615.52s)]
*  Okay, so what is the last thing that's left? The last thing that's left is government spending. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2621.84s)]
*  And you have to ask the question, what should governments do when rates are high? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2625.44s)]
*  There was a chart I published in my annual letter, if you just go to that for a second. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2630.08s)]
*  Just going back to this chart right before it, just so the people who are listening, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2636.4s)]
*  if you put the pie chart up, Nick, important for people to know consumer is about 70% of the [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2639.6s)]
*  economy. And if you put investment in government together, that's just over maybe 34% or something [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2644.3199999999997s)]
*  like that. 35%, exactly. So it is a consumer driven economy, but hey, corporate and government [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2650.88s)]
*  spending is a major piece as well. And then I just wanted just to highlight that when interest [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2656.08s)]
*  rates are very high, all of a sudden, governments are faced with this very difficult problem, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2662.7999999999997s)]
*  which is, oh man, I have to spend a ton of money on interest, just like if you had a bunch of credit [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2667.68s)]
*  cards, and all of a sudden the interest rates went up. So the choice is twofold. Do governments [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2671.68s)]
*  spend less? But unfortunately, it turns out that our governments in America, they just keep spending [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2677.92s)]
*  more and more. So even if net interest income is small, even if net interest income is high, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2685.04s)]
*  they're just like, forget it, the taps are on. So what does this all mean? I think what it really [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2689.92s)]
*  means is that we do a very poor job of measuring all these dynamics together. And so I actually [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2694.16s)]
*  trust the survey data of these individuals more than I trust the GDP report, in the sense that [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2700.08s)]
*  I think it more accurately captures this dynamic rates are at 6%. People are saving more, if they're [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2707.52s)]
*  not getting paid more, things are costing more. The government is giving you free money. So you [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2713.6s)]
*  kind of feel like everything is moving. So that the GDP measurement, the way that it's classically [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2718.64s)]
*  done shows that, wow, we grew at 3% or 4%. But the average individual American isn't feeling that [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2723.68s)]
*  they're actually feeling that they have less money. So I would actually go with them and actually say, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2730.16s)]
*  if we don't revisit this thing from first principles, we're going to get this dynamic where [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2736.64s)]
*  we think one thing is happening, but the actual exact opposite is happening. In this case, I do [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2741.6800000000003s)]
*  think we're in a quasi synthetic recession. Sacks, what's your take on the vibe session? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2746.1600000000003s)]
*  Well, look, I tend to agree with your mouth on this. I think this is a classic story of who do [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2753.36s)]
*  you believe? Do you believe the experts or do you believe in the intuitions of the American people? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2758.0800000000004s)]
*  And the experts have some statistics on their side, but the old saying goes, there's lies, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2763.36s)]
*  damn lies and statistics. And then the American people have their actual lived experience on their [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2770.32s)]
*  side. They know what they're feeling. And I tend to trust in that. And obviously, we're in an [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2776.88s)]
*  election year and the press knows that. So they're trying to do this big cleanup effort for Biden. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2781.92s)]
*  But why is it that people are feeling this way? Number one is inflation. And if you look at this [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2786.48s)]
*  chart, you can see that if you look at household net worth since the start of the Biden presidency [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2790.48s)]
*  and compare it to the change in household net worth at a similar point in Trump's presidency, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2798.16s)]
*  in nominal terms, it appears to be the same. But then if you adjust for inflation, in other words, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2804.16s)]
*  you look at the real household net worth, you can see that household net worth during the Biden term [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2808.72s)]
*  has been flat. Actually, it's down. Because of inflation, right? Because of inflation. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2814.72s)]
*  Where did the inflation come from? Where did the inflation come from? Yeah. Well, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2819.52s)]
*  Larry Summers warned in the first quarter of the Biden administration that if you pass an unnecessary [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2824.16s)]
*  $2 trillion of COVID stimulus, you would produce inflation. The inflation rate when Biden came into [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2830.56s)]
*  office was 1.7%. We had a rip-roaring economy, but he started stimulating. And we talked about [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2836.72s)]
*  Bidenomics is this new policy of pumping trillions of dollars of stimulus into a healthy economy, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2841.92s)]
*  which we've never done before. What happened? Inflation went all the way to 9%. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2848.48s)]
*  So people's wages have not kept up with the rate of inflation. This is why they feel worse off. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2852.64s)]
*  When you actually look at purchasing power, people are worse off in terms of their actual [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2857.6s)]
*  ability to buy things. Their purchasing power has gone down. Wages may have gone up a little bit, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2862.16s)]
*  but they have not gone up as much as inflation. So people feel worse off. Now, Larry also had that, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2866.72s)]
*  I think, really informative study showing that inflation would have peaked at 18% if you include [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2873.52s)]
*  cost of borrowing. So again, to Chamath's point, if you're trying to get a mortgage and you're [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2879.52s)]
*  paying 7.5%, 8%, you feel way worse off. If you need to buy a car and make a car payment, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2884.16s)]
*  you feel much worse off. If you've got credit card debt, which has now hit an all-time record [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2889.44s)]
*  of something like 1.1 trillion, your credit card rates have never been higher. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2894.24s)]
*  So the average American feels worse off because cost of borrowing has a huge impact [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2898.88s)]
*  on their household finances. And that's why if you read one of the last paragraphs in that story [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2902.88s)]
*  that you referred to, they use the key words, the consumer feels squeezed, the average household [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2907.84s)]
*  feels squeezed. They may not have lost their job yet, but they've lost purchasing power. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2912.88s)]
*  Yeah, they're under earning. They're under earning. And so the projection- [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2918.2400000000002s)]
*  So this is obvious. And the press can gaslight us all day long about how wonderful things are [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2921.92s)]
*  under Biden, but the average American, I think, understands differently based on their own [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2927.44s)]
*  experience. I think the whole thing comes down to the projection of an individual or a household [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2932.48s)]
*  of their lived experience onto the economy. You assume that because you're having a tough time, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2938.0s)]
*  the economy is bad. And the economy as a definition for them is how do I earn and how do I spend? [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2943.28s)]
*  And if I'm under earning, that means there must be serious job loss and things are more expensive. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2951.36s)]
*  And my ability to purchase isn't improving. And so I think we're all kind of going to end up on [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2957.28s)]
*  the same take on this one. I mean, Nick, if you want to pull this image up, this is, I think, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2962.48s)]
*  a helpful one, which is disposable personal income relative to outlays that folks are needing to [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2966.08s)]
*  spend more than they're making. So clearly indicating that they're feeling like they're [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2971.84s)]
*  under earning. So the projection of that is the economy is bad without recognizing that it is an [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2977.52s)]
*  inflationary experience. Whereas economists use the definition of quote, economic growth, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2982.56s)]
*  being gross production, gross product. And so if gross product or gross revenue is going up, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2988.4s)]
*  they're like, oh, the economy is healthy. We're growing. But the truth is, we're funding that [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2993.92s)]
*  growth with leverage at the national level, the federal level, and at the household and domestic [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=2998.2400000000002s)]
*  level. We are borrowing money to inflate the revenue numbers. And so the GDP goes up, but the [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3004.08s)]
*  debt is going up higher. And so the ability for folks to support themselves and buy things that [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3012.4s)]
*  they want to buy and continue to improve their condition in life has declined if things are [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3017.76s)]
*  getting worse. And if you go to the next image, as Sachs pointed out already, here's the image of [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3024.0s)]
*  total outstanding credit card debt over a trillion dollars. It's totally spiked. And it's going to [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3028.4s)]
*  continue to spike just like federal debt because of the next chart, which is the sudden jump in [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3034.0800000000004s)]
*  interest rates. So we've seen credit card interest rates jump from 12% on average 10 years ago to [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3039.5200000000004s)]
*  21.19% right now. And it was at 14% at the end of 2022. So we've gone from 14% average credit [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3046.72s)]
*  card interest rates to 22% now in just about 20 to 24 months. And so the projection that I think of [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3055.7599999999998s)]
*  the quote economy must be bad is resulted from the fact that income to spending is actually pretty [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3064.56s)]
*  negative. So here's the real median family income. This actually only goes through 2019. So it [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3071.44s)]
*  doesn't even capture the era that we're talking about. But this has been going on for quite some [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3076.48s)]
*  time that the average American's ability to improve their condition has largely been driven [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3081.52s)]
*  by their ability to borrow, not by their earnings. And this has created a substantial set of precedents [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3086.88s)]
*  that we're now running into a wall with interest rates spiking and inflation hitting us because [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3093.2000000000003s)]
*  of the overall federal debt that we've taken on. I think we're probably going to go around the horn [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3097.68s)]
*  and all agree. Obviously, the crazy spending started in the Trump and COVID era. And that [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3101.12s)]
*  caused a lot of the inflation as well, just to be fair, it's two administrations that are just out [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3106.96s)]
*  of control with spending. But the way I look at this is the Mickey D economy. People may not know [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3111.68s)]
*  this, but 96% of Americans eat meals at least once a year in McDonald's. 8% of Americans eat at [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3117.6s)]
*  McDonald's on an average day. And when you look at the prices of McDonald's here, if we look at [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3124.3199999999997s)]
*  this image- Yeah, this is incredible. This is incredible. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3129.44s)]
*  This is unbelievable. Medium French fries at McDonald's, $1.79 in 2019 and now $4.19. And then [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3131.28s)]
*  if we look at just McNuggets- My gosh. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3138.48s)]
*  $4.49 to $7.58, 68% increase. McChicken, $1.29 to $3.89. And then here is a very interesting one. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3141.04s)]
*  This is CPI versus McDonald's. Big Mac prices. If you take a look at that, as much as the consumer [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3149.52s)]
*  price index has surged, Big Macs have exceeded that. And so Americans are seeing this over and [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3155.04s)]
*  over again when they go to McDonald's and other places. And that's what's causing the feeling. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3161.68s)]
*  Because when you spend- Go back to that McNugget chart. I just want to see, what is it? End of [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3168.48s)]
*  2019. So this is basically, you'd want to look at the four-year stock price, right? So these guys [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3173.36s)]
*  have jacked up prices massively. If you look at what's happened to the stock, the stock is way [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3178.16s)]
*  up. It's kind of been, they've been very motivated and rewarded as a company for just rewarding the [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3183.2s)]
*  shareholder and kind of screwing over the customer. If you own equities in McDonald's and you're in the [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3188.96s)]
*  top third or half, maybe half of Americans who have equity exposure, you're feeling great. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3193.9199999999996s)]
*  If you're on the bottom third or half and you're buying at McDonald's and you don't own equity in [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3199.3599999999997s)]
*  McDonald's, you feel terrible, free break, you had some additional thoughts. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3204.0s)]
*  Yeah. But remember what McDonald's and other fast food companies have said is that labor [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3206.8799999999997s)]
*  costs have climbed. Here's a chart on labor costs that Nick can pull up. Workers at Walmart and [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3212.08s)]
*  McDonald's have had pay increases, but this has really been to try and keep up with inflation, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3217.2799999999997s)]
*  the inflation of other costs. So a lot of people will say, oh, they're price gouging, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3223.52s)]
*  they're ripping off consumers to make profits for shareholders. But the truth is, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3228.24s)]
*  the biggest component of running those restaurants is labor. And labor has gotten more expensive [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3231.68s)]
*  because the employees that work there have to earn enough to pay their bills and to afford their [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3237.12s)]
*  food. And this is the circular effect of inflation. It finds its way all through the economy, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3242.4s)]
*  it filters down, and it eventually hits everyone. Look, fast food is a pretty competitive business. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3248.16s)]
*  I mean, I think the reason why McDonald's is raising prices because everyone else is raising [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3252.72s)]
*  prices. I mean, otherwise they'd be losing share. And just look, go to the grocery store and look at [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3256.72s)]
*  the price of steak or chicken or whatever, or eggs. It's gone up tremendously over the last few [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3260.7999999999997s)]
*  years. I mean, let me ask you a candy question. When's the last time you were in supermarket? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3266.0s)]
*  Be honest. When's the last time you literally went to a, I'm just curious. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3272.08s)]
*  It's not relevant. I mean, yeah, obviously we know that the price of eggs doesn't affect me. Okay, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3277.04s)]
*  great. I'm in a fortunate position. That's not what the topic is. The topic is, what is the impact on [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3283.28s)]
*  the American people and why, why do 70% of the people in that poll feel that we're in a recession, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3287.68s)]
*  even though the expert tell us we're not? And I've explained it. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3293.68s)]
*  Yeah. And the other thing is there's a- I went to the supermarket the other day. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3296.8799999999997s)]
*  I like going to the supermarket. I take my groceries every week. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3301.2s)]
*  I cannot believe how expensive things, I mean, some of the stuff, I was just blown away how [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3303.68s)]
*  expensive things- It's bonkers. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3308.16s)]
*  It's bonkers. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3309.12s)]
*  Look at the package I sent you guys, the Driscoll's super sweet strawberries. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3309.7599999999998s)]
*  How much were they? [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3313.7599999999998s)]
*  6.99. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3314.3999999999996s)]
*  You quartered the market on the nine- [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3314.56s)]
*  I went and tried to find them here in San Mateo and there's none left. They said [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3315.68s)]
*  Chamath quartered the market. I went to Sagonas. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3318.7999999999997s)]
*  Nat and I go to Sagonas every week, A, because we like buying our own fruit, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3322.1600000000003s)]
*  but also B, because our kids like to do it and they like to see what things cost and they like [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3327.52s)]
*  to pick stuff. But this sweetest batch was seven bucks. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3331.36s)]
*  For how many strawberries is that, by the way? [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3335.44s)]
*  12 strawberries in there? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3337.04s)]
*  Well, so here's what I'll tell you quite honestly. I think that you need to put these guys on notice. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3338.08s)]
*  Oh, on blast. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3345.28s)]
*  The perfume, the nose, it's incredible. The aroma, yeah. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3346.56s)]
*  The smell is the aroma. It's just absolutely incredible. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3352.88s)]
*  But to be totally honest with you, the mouthfeel and the sweetness is not what this label [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3356.96s)]
*  would imply. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3362.96s)]
*  What were you expecting in terms of mouthfeel? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3364.7999999999997s)]
*  I was expecting something juicier, more succulent. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3367.2s)]
*  Let me ask you a question, Chamath. Do you have a sommelier for your fruit? [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3373.2799999999997s)]
*  You seem like a real connoisseur here. Did you do a tasting of fruit? [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3377.2799999999997s)]
*  No, I told you. I've been texting Friedberg about this for months. I am a connoisseur of fruit. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3380.16s)]
*  It's very important to me. I like good fruit. So my wife and I go and find good fruit for our [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3389.52s)]
*  family. And it's really expensive. And even this over promises and under delivers. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3394.56s)]
*  So Friedberg, if you can land a GMO strawberry, I'm going to put it in my bell. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3399.2799999999997s)]
*  Give me a GMO strawberry Friedberg, twice as big, three times as sweet. Get in my bell. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3404.72s)]
*  I think we should all go to Tokyo for a weekend and do some fruit tasting in Tokyo. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3411.6s)]
*  You have to get on the Hokkaido strawberries. This is where it's at. You have no idea what [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3416.08s)]
*  you can spend on strawberries. People are spending 10 bucks on a strawberry. It is bonkers. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3422.64s)]
*  I bought a hundred dollar mango once in Tokyo. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3426.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah, incredible. The other thing I think with these numbers is, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3429.4399999999996s)]
*  if you're an economist and you're like, inflation has gone down, that means the rate of inflation [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3434.24s)]
*  has gone down from six or 7% down to 3% or 2.9 or 3.1. That doesn't mean prices aren't still going [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3440.48s)]
*  up. And so the question is, how do you want to cycle down? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3446.08s)]
*  If you want to replace GDP, there was a very good article in the Wall Street Journal a few weeks [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3448.7999999999997s)]
*  ago about how there's been just a total breakdown in what these high level numbers say, kind of what [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3454.7999999999997s)]
*  we've been saying and how Americans feel. And they introduced a different score. Well, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3459.68s)]
*  they gave it publicity. It's not their score, but it's something that they call the core score. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3464.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3469.04s)]
*  And what that does, I'll just read it to you just so you can understand it. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3469.7599999999998s)]
*  It's a county level index of wellbeing using measures of economic security, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3473.7599999999998s)]
*  economic opportunity, health and political voice. And so the lowest possible score is zero. The [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3479.44s)]
*  highest possible score is 10. As it turns out, when they use this across every county in America, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3484.3999999999996s)]
*  the distribution is basically as follows. The most, quote unquote, prosperous county is [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3490.16s)]
*  Falls Church, Virginia, which is a 7.86 out of 10. And the lowest county is Jim Hogg County of Texas, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3495.68s)]
*  which has a score of 2.25. So to the extent that you want to start to look at granular measures, [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3503.8399999999997s)]
*  this is one. I'm not going to advocate for it, but it's an example. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3508.96s)]
*  But what do you notice in here? What I notice is that there's a lot of patches of like, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3512.64s)]
*  meh, to not good in most parts of America. And so other than a very few small pockets where people [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3518.24s)]
*  feel great, most of the country is sort of dissatisfied. And I think that that's a really [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3526.0s)]
*  important thing to internalize. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3532.4s)]
*  Yeah. Some of this is classic psychology. People do focus on the negative, the media focuses on the [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3534.8s)]
*  negative. And then with social media, people are seeing lifestyles that are unattainable, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3540.64s)]
*  just like they're seeing body types that are unattainable because people are doing filters. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3545.68s)]
*  You're also seeing people living a lifestyle that's unattainable. And then it makes people, [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3549.12s)]
*  because their expectation of their life is so high, when they then subtract the reality of [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3553.9199999999996s)]
*  their life, they've got a deficit. And really happiness is like expectations minus reality [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3559.2799999999997s)]
*  equals happiness. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3564.64s)]
*  Yeah. But you had that same dynamic when consumer sentiment was much higher in a previous [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3565.9199999999996s)]
*  administration, people are feeling much better about the economy. So that's a constant. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3570.08s)]
*  People were having free money. Trump dropped free money on people's heads. So your argument that [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3574.1600000000003s)]
*  Biden's crazy spending, Trump sent them free checks with his name on it. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3580.4s)]
*  Yeah. When the economy was down 33% year over year. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3584.7200000000003s)]
*  But you admit that he spent way too much money, right? You admit he spent way too much money. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3588.6400000000003s)]
*  Both parties thought that we were headed for a depression. And so we had a bipartisan stimulus [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3592.8s)]
*  bill during an actual crisis. Once the crisis was over, there was no need to keep spending. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3598.32s)]
*  So when Trump signed his name on those checks, he wasn't responsible. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3604.0s)]
*  Once the seal has been broken, I think it's fair to say both sides of the aisle now believe [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3610.88s)]
*  that they can give away an enormous amount of money. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3617.68s)]
*  There's nobody that feels like they have a responsibility to stop. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3622.8s)]
*  But I think what Sachs is right in the sense that, so if you take that as a constant, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3626.64s)]
*  right, that there will always be handouts now of all kinds. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3632.0800000000004s)]
*  There'll be different flavors depending on whether it's a Republican or whether a Democrat. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3636.48s)]
*  A Democrat may- [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3639.76s)]
*  And all rationalized. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3640.7200000000003s)]
*  So then what I'm saying is- [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3643.6000000000004s)]
*  That's my point. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3644.48s)]
*  This abstraction though doesn't solve what's happening now because this free money is in [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3645.36s)]
*  the system. It's constantly in the system. It comes in different waves. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3650.0800000000004s)]
*  So people should feel better. The fact that they don't in the face of this constant money train [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3654.4s)]
*  I think is actually quite alarming. I think what the point is, which is we are economically [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3659.6s)]
*  in a very complicated moment in the sense that there is no pandemic to blame. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3664.7200000000003s)]
*  There's no economy that's totally shut down. In fact, there's an economy that seems to be moving [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3668.96s)]
*  but leaving an enormous number of people behind. So however it has been structured, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3674.2400000000002s)]
*  just sitting here today in 2024, it's broken for more people than it's working for. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3678.96s)]
*  Trump, just to give facts, Trump will have spent 7.8 trillion. Biden will spend slightly less, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3684.64s)]
*  like 6.X trillion. At the end of these things, they're both going to have added 15 trillion. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3689.68s)]
*  You're missing the fact that Trump had 2020 with when we had the COVID depression or what [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3693.2799999999997s)]
*  would have been when the economy was down 30% a year every year. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3699.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And a terribly timed tax. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3703.6s)]
*  By the way, did you guys see it, Frank? [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3705.7599999999998s)]
*  Hold on a second. Let me just make this one point. Just because both parties have been [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3707.3599999999997s)]
*  irresponsible on spending doesn't mean that we can't make further judgments about who's been worse. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3712.08s)]
*  What's happened in the Biden administration is just quantitatively worse. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3718.64s)]
*  Well, no. Quantitatively, Trump spent more. But you're saying qualitatively Biden's is worse [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3722.0s)]
*  because he didn't need to. There was no crisis. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3726.88s)]
*  Right. Okay. I got it. So one spent more, one spent less, but one didn't need to and one [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3729.68s)]
*  absolutely didn't. Look at Trump's spending before COVID. Look at Trump's spending before COVID. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3733.76s)]
*  It was like a 5% bump on Obama's spending. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3738.56s)]
*  Well, the tax break was the one that accounted for a lot of- [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3741.92s)]
*  Yeah. But anyway, we can sit here and debate Trump versus Biden. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3745.84s)]
*  Let's talk about my balls, boys. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3749.12s)]
*  Yeah. We're wasting time here. Wasting time on Trump and Biden when we could be talking- [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3750.72s)]
*  Let's get to my ballon. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3755.12s)]
*  If we're going to talk about our balls, we need to go to somebody who's an expert [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3756.72s)]
*  on our testicles. Freeberg, let's go right to Science Corner. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3762.56s)]
*  Let's talk about our balls with the Sultan of Science. There's been a study on phthalates, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3767.52s)]
*  our balls and plastic in our balls. Freeberg, tee this up. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3774.24s)]
*  Yeah. The Consumer Reports put out a really interesting, or what has become pretty widely [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3777.68s)]
*  covered now story a couple of weeks ago, where they measured phthalates in common foods. And Nick, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3783.52s)]
*  if you want to just pull up the image that's been repeated in a lot of media, a lot of press, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3788.88s)]
*  people were going nuts over this. Phthalates are these chemical compounds that are used in plastics [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3792.72s)]
*  or used with plastics to soften them. So when you make plastics, you can make them softer and [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3799.2s)]
*  form them into all sorts of different shapes and use them for different applications like plastic [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3805.04s)]
*  bags or wraps or tubes or all sorts of things. And phthalates are these smaller molecules that [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3809.12s)]
*  go along with the polymers that are the basis of the plastics. And they measured phthalates, [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3816.08s)]
*  which are known to be toxic in terms of if you get enough of them, they can be carcinogenic and [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3821.68s)]
*  cause cancer. And they showed that every product they tested had phthalates in it. Wendy's chicken [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3826.56s)]
*  nuggets had 33,000 nanograms per serving. If you scroll up to the top- [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3833.7599999999998s)]
*  Wait, look at the Chipotle chicken burrito. Oh my God. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3839.3599999999997s)]
*  Right. And just to be clear, guys, this is not just about packaging. Packaging plays a role, [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3842.48s)]
*  but the whole food supply chain, the way we wrap food, all of our water, all of our dust, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3848.32s)]
*  all of the air we breathe, we have measured phthalates in everything. So these phthalates [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3853.6800000000003s)]
*  end up in the animals that are used to make milk and the animals that people eat. They end up in [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3859.04s)]
*  the water that goes into the vegetables that we grow in the ground. They end up being used to make [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3863.36s)]
*  the little plastic jars that we feed our kids out of, the little yogurt pouches that our kids drink [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3867.92s)]
*  out of, everything just to move food around in plastic packaging. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3872.48s)]
*  Sorry, Freeberg, why would the chicken nuggets from Wendy's though be so- [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3876.32s)]
*  Is it because they are eating? They are eating things that have plastics in them. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3881.04s)]
*  Plastics in them. But we also don't know- [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3885.6000000000004s)]
*  And so then we're eating the chicken, so we're eating the plastic. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3888.0s)]
*  We're eating the plastic. And it's also the fact that the way that they process the chicken and [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3890.56s)]
*  the material that they use and the packaging that they use and how they move this stuff from one [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3894.0800000000004s)]
*  place to another, you've got bags that are holding chicken breasts that then get put in the thing. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3897.92s)]
*  And then the oil has, the oil is transported in plastic. We don't know. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3902.3999999999996s)]
*  So it's plastics all the way down. Guys, look at this. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3906.64s)]
*  These are the things like, look at Annie's. First of all, I really dislike Annie's labeling and [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3910.3199999999997s)]
*  packaging. I think it's very ugly, so I've never bought it for that reason. But I know that there's [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3916.08s)]
*  a lot of private equity moms that buy Annie's because it's supposed to be better for- [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3920.8799999999997s)]
*  Here, keep going, Jack. This is a really good point. Hold on, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3924.8799999999997s)]
*  Chamath's making a really good point. Go ahead, Chamath. This is really good. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3929.2s)]
*  And so the problem is you see organic. When you go, again, we go to Drager's. That's typically [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3931.7599999999998s)]
*  where we go sometimes to go to Whole Foods, but we go to Drager's in Sagonas. That's the places we go [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3937.52s)]
*  to in our neighborhood. And when you go and you look at these things like prepared meals, as an [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3941.2s)]
*  example, the thing that has always attracted me to Annie's is because it is positioned as it is [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3946.16s)]
*  cleaner and better for you. And you see everybody buying it and what you actually see sitting on the [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3952.48s)]
*  shelf that's left over is actually the Chef Boyardee and the Campbell's. And I always [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3958.08s)]
*  thought to myself, I won't buy Annie's because I actually don't like the label, to be honest. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3963.36s)]
*  That was really why I just deeply dislike the packaging. But it turns out it's the [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3968.0s)]
*  actual worst for you. Yeah, it is. And let me just tell you guys some stats about this. So we produce [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3972.88s)]
*  about three million tons of Daylights a year, creating them that we use in our industrial [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3978.7999999999997s)]
*  supply chain. The global market for Daylights is about $10 billion per year. We find it everywhere. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3982.72s)]
*  In our tap water, as measured in the U.S. in multiple places, there's about one microgram. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3988.9599999999996s)]
*  So those were nanograms. So you kind of divide it by a thousand so that Annie's thing has 50 [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3995.12s)]
*  micrograms of Daylights in it. But there's about one microgram of Daylights per liter of water that [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=3999.68s)]
*  you're drinking. Now, a study was done out of Germany where they basically tried to estimate [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4004.64s)]
*  how much people were consuming. And on average, people consume or ingest about six micrograms [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4010.7200000000003s)]
*  of Daylights per kilogram of your body weight per day. So an adult male is consuming about 500 [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4016.64s)]
*  micrograms of Daylights per day. That's half a gram per day. And the human body metabolizes [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4022.88s)]
*  and excretes it. It comes out. The EPA, all of the administrative agencies that oversee this stuff, [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4028.96s)]
*  they're like, it's okay. We metabolize it as long as we don't consume more than we can metabolize. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4033.84s)]
*  It's going to be safe because it's not going to stay in our bodies. It's going to wash out. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4039.52s)]
*  Here's the problem. While it's in your body, while it's moving through your body, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4042.7200000000003s)]
*  being metabolized, it is what's called an endocrine disruptor. And we talked about this [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4046.8s)]
*  in the past with respect to the sunscreens. These Daylights actually interfere with the [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4050.56s)]
*  hormones that are made by things like your pituitary gland, your thyroid, and even some [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4055.52s)]
*  of the hormones that are produced in testicle cells. There was another study done that really [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4060.2400000000002s)]
*  tried to estimate what the impact was. And here is a study that showed how do Daylights actually [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4066.64s)]
*  interact with different parts of the endocrine system. And they went through and they found all [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4072.8799999999997s)]
*  these places that biological hormones and the endocrine system are disrupted by the Daylights. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4079.12s)]
*  And we'll put credit for everyone that shared these papers here later. And they basically showed [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4086.16s)]
*  the mechanism by which the Daylights are actually disrupting endocrine systems. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4093.92s)]
*  Now, what is the endocrine system? We talked about endocrine disruptors in the past. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4100.4800000000005s)]
*  The endocrine system is the interaction of hormones with cells in your body produced by [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4104.4s)]
*  all these different glands in your body, like your thyroid, your pituitary gland, and so on, [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4109.28s)]
*  controls things like growth, tissue development, reproductive tissue activity, like making sperm [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4112.96s)]
*  cells, autonomic function, like body temperature, blood pressure, sleep, heart rate regulation, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4118.32s)]
*  injury and stress repons, your mood. All of those things are regulated by your endocrine system. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4123.76s)]
*  And so when the hormones or the proteins or peptides that are made by those glands [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4128.56s)]
*  are disrupted by these Daylights, it can actually disrupt those systems and mess them up. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4132.96s)]
*  So while we're not consuming, generally speaking, enough Daylights to cause cancer, [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4137.2s)]
*  and therefore we all say, hey, it's okay, these Daylights aren't that bad. We're not going to all [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4142.64s)]
*  die from cancer. The truth is there is demonstrations now on how they can actually [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4146.320000000001s)]
*  disrupt the activity of your endocrine system and as a result have all of these deleterious effects. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4151.68s)]
*  Another study done on 125 men out of China, this paper was done out of China, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4156.400000000001s)]
*  they saw damage to testicle cells that would die, testicle cells that would produce fewer sperm, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4162.400000000001s)]
*  and then testicle cells that produced sperm with extra nuclei. And they actually demonstrated this [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4170.0s)]
*  in rats. So the set of compounds can be fairly disruptive. So now we'll go to the next story. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4174.8s)]
*  The next story is the one that everyone's writing about, which is, oh my God, there's plastic and [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4181.68s)]
*  balls. So a team at University of New Mexico that was published in the Journal of Toxicological [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4184.56s)]
*  Sciences just last week, they took 47 neutered dog's testicles from a local pet clinic where [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4189.92s)]
*  they were getting neutered. And they found on average 128 micrograms per gram of microplastics [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4195.68s)]
*  in those testicles. And it was mostly polyvinyl chloride or one of the main plastics and [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4202.64s)]
*  polyethylene. And again, phthalates leach out of these plastics and leach into the cells. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4208.0s)]
*  And then they went to the medical investigators office and they found these, the testicles that [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4214.0s)]
*  were frozen for seven years because when they do a medical investigation and they keep all the body [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4219.12s)]
*  parts, they keep them on ice and then they throw them away after seven years. So before they threw [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4222.8s)]
*  them away, they got humans, they got permission to use these testicles to figure out are their [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4226.0s)]
*  plastics and they measure them. In the frozen balls? In the frozen balls. These are ancient frozen [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4231.92s)]
*  balls. How old are these balls? 23 frozen balls, about seven years old. Seven year old balls frozen. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4236.96s)]
*  Wait, are people donating their balls to science? Is that how this is happening? [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4242.64s)]
*  When there's like a homicide or someone and or you don't know who died or there's an investigation [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4245.84s)]
*  into why someone died, the coroner, the coroner keeps the body parts in case it's needed for a [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4251.04s)]
*  like a police case later. All right. On the record, I don't want my balls used that way. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4257.36s)]
*  Okay. You don't have these frozen balls on your driver's license? Like freeze my balls? [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4262.8s)]
*  They asked me to store my balls, I think. They said you've got such huge balls. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4266.72s)]
*  Anyway, they got 23 of these balls from these bodies and they found plastics on average, [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4270.8s)]
*  328 micrograms per gram of testicle in these balls. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4278.32s)]
*  What do you usually find, Freberg? What do you usually find in these balls? [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4285.4400000000005s)]
*  We don't know because we've never taken human tissue and tried to take it apart in a very [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4289.4400000000005s)]
*  detailed way to figure out like how much plastic is there, what is it doing to our body. But now, [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4292.72s)]
*  I just want to connect the dots. Now we have a sense that there's these phthalates and these [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4297.84s)]
*  other compounds that come with plastics that leak in that cause all this disruption. Separately, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4301.68s)]
*  we're seeing this accumulation of these little plastic particles. Remember, plastics are polymers. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4305.68s)]
*  They're long chains of monomers. They can be short chains, they can be long, so they break apart, [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4311.36s)]
*  break apart, break apart, and little tiny bits of them end up and they're very hard to metabolize [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4316.16s)]
*  and they sit in your tissue and then they can cause all this disruption. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4320.32s)]
*  I think these are generally not- I'm just going to say it. First of all, [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4325.28s)]
*  I really appreciate that you did this. I think it's so important. We talked about microplastics a [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4328.88s)]
*  little bit ago. J. Cal moved his whole family away, I guess, a few years ago from plastics. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4334.0s)]
*  I've started to do it four or five months ago after NAC. But you can't get away from it. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4339.44s)]
*  It is everywhere. It's in the supply chain is your point. It's in the water, it's in the air, [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4343.2s)]
*  it's everywhere. This is what I was going to say. I think our food supply, I think we should just [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4348.64s)]
*  say it out loud, is totally corrupted. I think there's all of these other factors we look at, [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4352.24s)]
*  the rise in the use of SSRIs, the lack of sexual function in young men, the lack of sex, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4358.96s)]
*  the low birth rate. I think these are all related and part of it is the food supply. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4366.72s)]
*  And part of the food supply problem is the fact that it is corrupted by these materials that [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4372.56s)]
*  should never be in our body. I want to just push back on this because I don't want to limit it. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4377.6s)]
*  That's a guess, but I honestly think it's the truth. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4381.2s)]
*  I don't want to limit it to the food supply because here's the other thing. All of us are [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4384.72s)]
*  wearing clothes that use polymers, which are plastics. All of us are sitting at desks that [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4388.16s)]
*  have coatings of polymers on them. All of us have iPhones that use polymers. All of us [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4393.44s)]
*  drive cars and the rubber, one of the ways that they found that plastic, these microparticles [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4399.36s)]
*  are getting in the air is through tires. When we drive, little particulates end up in the atmosphere, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4404.32s)]
*  we breathe them in and then they end up in our body. Every part of our industrial supply chain [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4409.44s)]
*  uses polymers. Every part of our industrial supply chain- [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4414.879999999999s)]
*  I hear you, but the concentration, I'm going to guess that the concentration, when you actually [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4416.879999999999s)]
*  put it in your body and then your intestines and your organs are bathed in this stuff, [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4421.44s)]
*  I'm going to guess that the food supply has a huge part to do with this. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4429.2s)]
*  Yeah, but let's say you're wearing clothing. Almost all of our clothes now, many of our clothes [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4433.2s)]
*  have polymers in them. We put it in the washing machine, it ends up in the water supply chain, [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4438.48s)]
*  we consume that water. It's very hard to say that there's a specific action. Our whole system [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4442.4s)]
*  has been inundated with these lower- [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4448.8s)]
*  Okay, then let me say it in a way that maybe you will agree with then. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4451.28s)]
*  We need to fix something. My starting point would be the food supply. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4455.12s)]
*  Yeah. Where do you start? Yeah. My big takeaway is sort of like yours, [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4459.2s)]
*  which is almost impossible to alter this industry overnight, given how ubiquitous these [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4463.44s)]
*  compounds are and everything we do and touch, tires, phones, clothing, et cetera. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4467.28s)]
*  But I think that this is going to trigger and is the beginning of a wave. I'm noticing [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4472.4s)]
*  that a lot of folks are going to start to pay attention in the food industry and start to [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4476.72s)]
*  figure out ways to represent low plastic, low-phalate food products as a way to sell [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4481.76s)]
*  a more premium solution. I think that's been the trend historically with the food industry, [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4488.0s)]
*  Chamath, is to respond to your ask right now and to then show up with solutions. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4491.92s)]
*  Just taking a step back, we don't have to use these. These are all based on fossil fuels, [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4499.12s)]
*  so the way we make plastics is we basically pull oil out of the ground and we turn it into these [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4505.84s)]
*  polymers. That's the basis of this chemical industry. We don't have to do that. With the [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4509.84s)]
*  same function, we can get the same function from what are called bioplastics. These are compounds [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4515.360000000001s)]
*  that can actually be much more biodegradable that are made with biological systems and not made [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4520.32s)]
*  from oil using synthetic chemicals systems. I do think that there is a really big opportunity [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4525.6s)]
*  for a wave of bioplastic alternatives given that this is now becoming a little bit more [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4533.04s)]
*  obvious to folks that there is this systemic problem, that this is ubiquitous, and that we [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4538.16s)]
*  do need to address it. Okay, so just zooming out here for a minute, we talked about the phalates, [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4542.88s)]
*  but what about the Bophas, Freberg? The study on the Bophas. Let me play in. What are the Bophas, [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4547.92s)]
*  the air horn? Nick, play the air horn. No, no, okay. Let's get serious here for a second. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4585.52s)]
*  I have a real question. Part of the thing that I think is broken is that I think somewhere along [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4589.68s)]
*  the way we got screwed up in how food is labeled, and then it was gamed effectively. So for years, [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4594.320000000001s)]
*  even when I was growing up, I thought you should not buy food that was high in fat, as an example. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4601.92s)]
*  And little did I know I was ingesting all these sugars as a substitute to fat. It was a total [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4607.76s)]
*  mistake. Does the labeling need to become simpler and focus on these things that are just [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4612.16s)]
*  fundamentally carcinogenic for us? One. Two, are there lawsuits that need to happen, a la cigarettes [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4617.12s)]
*  where you kind of connect the dots between these phthalates and a bunch of these diseases? [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4624.96s)]
*  Because it just seems like people have thrown their hands in the air for years, right? Some [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4631.44s)]
*  people say autism and diet are correlated, right? Other people, so there's crones, [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4635.92s)]
*  the rise of crones. There's so many of these conditions that there is a cohort of people [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4641.4400000000005s)]
*  that attribute most of the reason the pathology of the disease exists to food. So what do we do? [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4647.12s)]
*  We're pesticides, right? Yeah, that was in there too. Is that your actual office behind you? Or [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4654.4800000000005s)]
*  is that a background, Jamal? This is my real office. Yeah, yeah. So every one of those books [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4658.4800000000005s)]
*  is coded in some of these compounds. No, these are phthalate free because these are from the [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4664.16s)]
*  1400s. They didn't have that back then. Okay, good. All right. Well, everything else at the desk is [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4670.4s)]
*  made of all of those- They're collector's items. Yeah. These are collector's items, bro. These are [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4676.08s)]
*  from an era where that stuff didn't exist. And you're pure, I'm assuming you're wearing a pure [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4681.04s)]
*  baby wool sweater, which doesn't have any polymer. Yeah, it's baby cashmere. Yeah. But I think what's [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4685.759999999999s)]
*  overwhelming about this problem- That's why it's degradable, right? I think baby [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4691.2s)]
*  cashmere is why it's degradable. Yeah. What's overwhelming about this problem is the ubiquity [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4695.599999999999s)]
*  of the problem. It's almost like asking, tell me everywhere that carbon is used. Imagine if you [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4700.5599999999995s)]
*  had to label every M&M you're eating. No, I know, but that's what I'm trying to hone you into this [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4706.4s)]
*  one area that I actually- I get the tires and the this and the that. I'm trying to get to something [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4709.84s)]
*  that I fundamentally care about. I have young children. I feed them food every day. I don't [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4714.4s)]
*  trust my food supply. I've never really trusted it. And this kind of stuff adds to this body of [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4719.68s)]
*  evidence where I'm worried that if my kids go through some kind of an issue, at the core of [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4725.280000000001s)]
*  it will actually be something dietary. And it's typically overlooked by modern medicine, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4731.6s)]
*  because you'll treat it symptomologically. You'll try to give it some kind of pill. It's not how you [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4736.88s)]
*  treat a lot of these things. It could turn out. Where- I think- Restructuring someone's diet [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4742.240000000001s)]
*  can actually have an enormous impact. So I'm just trying to figure out what is something that we can [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4747.76s)]
*  all start to do to get a handle on this, because you're putting food in your body every day. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4751.92s)]
*  Aaron Powell Yeah. It seems like you're saying it's helpless here, [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4757.280000000001s)]
*  Freebird. There's nothing we can do. And I think what Chamath and I are asking you is, [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4761.68s)]
*  where do we start? How can we start to get off of plastics? [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4765.68s)]
*  Freebird I think we got to go into the source. So biopolymers are made by living organisms. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4769.12s)]
*  They're typically longer chains of what are more like sugar molecules. And they can be used in a [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4774.56s)]
*  similar way that we're- they're not going to be as good as synthetic polymers that we use today. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4781.76s)]
*  So a lot of our applications, a lot of our industry would have to be rebuilt if we really [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4786.88s)]
*  wanted to go back to redesign the whole system. But we got to redesign the whole system, Chamath. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4790.32s)]
*  We're making everything out of these products because they're cheap. And because we can pull [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4795.04s)]
*  oil out of the ground and turn it into cheap stuff. And then it makes things affordable for [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4798.8s)]
*  everyone on earth. And that's how this industry emerged. You know, it was not like someone [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4802.64s)]
*  randomly came along and said, let's put plastics in everything because it's going to be good for [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4807.360000000001s)]
*  people. It was a way to make products more accessible and more available and cheaper. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4810.96s)]
*  And it's everywhere. And so I think there's this real question of like, [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4814.72s)]
*  what industrial synthetic chemistries do we use today as a species that we should rethink using [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4819.200000000001s)]
*  and start at that level and then rebuild from there? And I think shining a light on this stuff [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4825.04s)]
*  and just talking about what these products are and how they find their way starts us. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4829.52s)]
*  I think that's a lot of laudatory, but too complicated. I want something simpler, [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4832.72s)]
*  which is like, can we get a law passed so that chickens cannot eat certain kinds of food that [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4836.4800000000005s)]
*  are known to be high in phthalates? Yeah. And here's an idea. Look at this Chamath. Like look [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4841.84s)]
*  at this banana. Like I just, as a newsflash, a banana already has a wrapper called the peel. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4845.84s)]
*  And then people are wrapping plastics on this stuff. Like I think consumers need to demand that. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4852.0s)]
*  Why did you take a picture of a banana? Why did you take a picture of a banana? [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4857.2s)]
*  I found that on the internet. I didn't actually take it myself. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4860.72s)]
*  I thought you were like sitting at the store, [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4863.2s)]
*  you know, when you see this kind of packaging, this is what has made me nuts in my life is [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4866.4s)]
*  all this crazy packaging going on. And in Europe, you are required at the supermarket [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4871.04s)]
*  and people do this when they get to the end of the counter, they take the packaging off. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4876.64s)]
*  The supermarket has to take the packaging, right? So they have to bear the burden of it. So if you [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4880.0s)]
*  get a tube of toothpaste, you can take the packaging off and hand them the thing. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4884.32s)]
*  Other places are now saying, Hey, if you're coming for peanut butter or grains or flour or sugar, [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4887.5199999999995s)]
*  they have a barrel of sugar. They put it in a brown bag and you get this like more clean [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4892.719999999999s)]
*  experience. I think we have to have like both ends of this, the supply chain, but also consumers. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4898.5599999999995s)]
*  There's a, there's like a marketing. I want my bananas to come with packaging on them. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4903.04s)]
*  You do you want to have fingerprints? I don't want anyone's fingerprints. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4906.96s)]
*  I want everything to come in hermetically sealed plastic. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4910.08s)]
*  Yeah. But then how many people in your house handle your banana? [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4923.04s)]
*  Pause. Whoa. Whoa. How many people in his house handled his banana? [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4925.6s)]
*  No, but the real issue is not that it's like when the girls in your family have puberty [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4932.4s)]
*  younger and younger and you're like, why is that happening or inconsistent periods? Or when the [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4938.16s)]
*  boys go through these weird, you know, moments where they're like not really growing. I'm just [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4942.32s)]
*  telling you like, there's so many things that we have to panic about. It's hard to, to your point, [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4948.96s)]
*  it's hard to attribute. Yeah. To one thing. Yeah. But I think, I think the, I think the thing that [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4954.0s)]
*  everybody could get, get focused on is how can you correct at least the marketing versus the reality [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4958.5599999999995s)]
*  in our food supply? You know, a different example, I remember Nat telling me something, [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4964.08s)]
*  which was along the lines of like hormone free is something that's marketed, but like chickens had [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4967.76s)]
*  been hormone free since like the fifties, but it's like, there's some latent hormones left inside of [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4972.72s)]
*  them. And then some of the feed is, is really poorly constructed and you should be focused on [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4978.72s)]
*  like air chilled versus water chilled or whatever. There's just so much bullsh** out there. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4985.04s)]
*  Yeah. And I, so I think it's hard if you're like trying to take care of your family, [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4990.16s)]
*  make sense of it all. Yeah. Make sense of it all. It's just like, it seems impossible. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4994.8s)]
*  Everyone feels helpless and everyone wants to grasp on. I find this super frustrating [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=4998.16s)]
*  because it's something that I really care about my, like what I eat. Right. Totally. And it came [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5001.68s)]
*  from a place where a lot of disease in my family and then I was overweight when I was young. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5007.12s)]
*  And so I just want to kind of like toe off. No, I mean, you eat, and it's impossible. If you're [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5012.4s)]
*  eating vegetables, but my takeaway is there's going to be a lot of phthalates in my balls. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5017.04s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. Despite all the stuff that I do, I'm no better off than somebody eating at Wendy's [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5024.24s)]
*  in the end of the day. And I feel like, well, what is all that time and expense and difficulty? [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5030.08s)]
*  Is it, it's not worth it. Well, there's other health benefits too. And of course, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5035.84s)]
*  and there's environmental benefits, but you know, we went all glass bottles as I told you. And, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5039.28s)]
*  you know, then I find out that some of the cans we have, cause it's a couple of things we like, [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5044.72s)]
*  like certain natural sodas, they got plastic on the inside of the aluminum can. I'm like, [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5048.24s)]
*  I thought I was doing the right thing here by going to aluminum can. Exactly. So the moral of [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5053.12s)]
*  the story is don't try to do the right thing. I mean, I don't know. But anyway, I just want to, [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5059.2s)]
*  I think this stuff is unavoidable. I really do. That's why I'm not too worried about it. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5065.04s)]
*  I think you're right. And I think that's why you see all of these kinds of diseases, [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5070.0s)]
*  these chronic and acute conditions, just ticking up, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5075.679999999999s)]
*  Well, anyway, I think this was a fascinating science corner. And I took a screenshot of [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5080.5599999999995s)]
*  Saks during it. This is Saks' interest level. You can always tell how good it is. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5087.2s)]
*  I thought this was a science corner I could finally use. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5094.4s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah. They actually checked Saks' balls for the plastics and all they found were [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5097.76s)]
*  steel. So there it is. Yeah. It's just brass balls going around the horn here. What's your [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5103.4400000000005s)]

*  idiocracy in Mike Judge's film? I haven't seen it. Okay. So in the film, I'll just cue this up. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5115.360000000001s)]
*  Society has gone to the lowest possible IQ. Everybody's got an ADIQ and like people, [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5121.52s)]
*  like a reality TV star is running the country into the ground. That's what he has in idiocracy. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5127.120000000001s)]
*  And the number one television show is essentially a TikTok called ouch my balls. Here it is. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5134.160000000001s)]

*  where all the crops have died and they don't know how to make crops anymore is ouch my balls. It's [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9HEjdjyVn4&t=5165.84s)]
