**All In Podcast:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0)
*  Just so you know, everything is archived by the White House right now, so everything we say is recorded. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=0.0s)]
*  David Freeberg is a f***ing c***. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4.4s)]
*  Chamuff, stop. You're being recorded. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6.48s)]
*  Good. I hope this is discoverable. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=8.72s)]
*  F***ing c***. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=10.32s)]
*  There, White House. I just want you to know that. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=12.0s)]
*  Stupid. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=14.32s)]
*  Also, he did not pay his taxes in 2016. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=15.6s)]
*  Hahahaha. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=17.76s)]
*  You really want me to start with you? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=22.96s)]
*  You want me to start? You want me to put this in the archives? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=24.96s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=26.88s)]
*  Here, let me put this in the archives for you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=27.76s)]
*  I'm gonna pee my pants. I'm gonna pee my pants. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=29.36s)]
*  I think you need to shut the f*** up is what you need to do. Sorry White House. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=31.12s)]
*  I'm gonna pee my pants. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=34.08s)]
*  He also has some unpaid parking tickets for 2021. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=35.92s)]
*  Hahahaha. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=39.92s)]
*  You want me to start with you? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=41.12s)]
*  Alright everybody, welcome back to the number one podcast in the world with me again today. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=42.16s)]
*  Chamuff Palihapitiya, your chairman dictator. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=46.16s)]
*  David Freeberg, our Sultan of Science and two guests. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=48.72s)]
*  Obviously Ben Shapiro, very famous for having the greatest [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=53.28s)]
*  podcast in the world. How are you Ben? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=70.2s)]
*  I'm doing great. I'm just honored to be here, you know. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=74.04s)]
*  Yes. What work to do? You could exceed all in in the rankings. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=77.88s)]
*  No, we always judge ourselves, Ben, on three things. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=81.56s)]
*  In the rankings, when we look at how we're doing, what we see is Ben Shapiro, prayer from the Bible, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=86.76s)]
*  the New Testament. I don't think you've got it yet. You have the Old Testament, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  but you haven't gotten the new, you haven't gotten the sequel. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=98.92s)]
*  And then number three, murder. Also with us from the White House. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=101.8s)]
*  Yeah, welcome to All In, where we have a live feed into the White House today. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=106.68s)]
*  My good friend Antonio Gross is here. He is taking, I guess you're taking, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=112.2s)]
*  would it be safe to say a hiatus or you're from Valor to do a little tour of duty [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  in our government working on Doge? Is that the way to say it? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=122.76s)]
*  I'm still doing my day job, too, man. This is a seven day a week, 68 hour day job. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=125.48s)]
*  So I'm trying to do both. I've got some great partners are covering it for me. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=130.6s)]
*  And my firm has been tremendous in allowing me to do this. But now I'm still trying to do both. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=133.8s)]
*  Was it public prior to this week, Antonio, that you were doing this role? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=140.6s)]
*  Did you announce it anywhere? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=144.76s)]
*  I didn't announce it anywhere. No, the New York Times, they wrote a story about me going to SSA, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=145.8s)]
*  you know, which is better, sort of newer times down. Not right. But I was, I had been there. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=151.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I was out of Woodland, Maryland. 40% correct. Yeah, close enough. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=156.12s)]
*  Close enough. I'm sure they had no agenda. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=159.08s)]
*  Antonio, how does it work? So when you volunteered, is it that you and Elon and Steve just kind of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  figure out, let's put a senior person at every part of the administration where there's real [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=169.72000000000003s)]
*  opportunity? Why did you end up at SSA versus someplace else? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=175.56s)]
*  Interesting question, Jamoth. And by the way, it's great to see you guys, man. Thanks for having me [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=178.6s)]
*  on. I can see your laughs. You're like, you really make me laugh. Thank you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=181.16s)]
*  It's good to see you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=186.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=186.6s)]
*  Suit looks great, by the way. Yeah. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=188.12s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  When do you have to return it? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=190.6s)]
*  The rental is due at the end of the week. So yeah, no, what happened was I had actually [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=192.68s)]
*  volunteered to go to the VA because that's kind of, as you guys know, close to my heart. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=197.64s)]
*  And Elon said to me, look, great, you can do that next, but will you go to SSA first and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=202.68s)]
*  see what's going on there? Because it's the biggest internal problem we have and see what [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=208.04s)]
*  you find in fraud, waste and abuse. And so of course I said, sure, I'll do that. And I ended [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=211.64s)]
*  up on Woodland, Maryland with the good people at the SSA, the social administration. And that's [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=216.28s)]
*  where I started. That's how all this started for me. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=221.0s)]
*  And so do you, Antonio, go in there with a Doge engineer as your kind of sidekick per se, or you [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=223.39999999999998s)]
*  just go there solo and you show up and like, what happens day one when you walk in into the place? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=229.0s)]
*  Like, what do you do? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=234.92s)]
*  So I brought with me two great professionals, John and Peyton from Valor, one of them engineer, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=236.12s)]
*  the other one I'd say a finance ninja, both these guys are ninjas. And there was already a team [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=243.56s)]
*  there actually that was working with some great engineers. And one senior person, Scott Coulter, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=247.4s)]
*  who's from, actually worked at Lone Pine, started his own fund and had come here as a volunteer as [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=251.48000000000002s)]
*  well. So they were already doing some work, actually, particularly on the enumeration part [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=255.56s)]
*  of the system. So that is the system that you have numbers, the whole cleaning of the database, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=260.12s)]
*  the numbers, they had already started their project when I got there. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=264.76s)]
*  And what is the mandate as given to you, you know, as part of Doge? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  Fraud, waste and abuse. I mean, exactly what, you know, what, what Bill Clinton talked about, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=272.76s)]
*  what Barack Obama talked about, what all presidents, but maybe President Biden talked about [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=277.0s)]
*  going back in time, it was go figure out how to save some money, man, this system's going [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=281.8s)]
*  bankrupt, it's going to be bankrupt 2037. The country overall, as you guys know, talked about [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  many times is on its way toward bankruptcy, went to something and go, go for how we can save money, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=289.32s)]
*  go find fraud. And we don't let's get to it. You spoke at a rally, I think it was on Sunday. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=294.12s)]
*  And you pulled up a chart. Here's that chart. Maybe you could explain to the American people [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=301.8s)]
*  here what this chart shows. Yeah. So if I went to step back and say, I got it is an important, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=307.32s)]
*  we map the way we work, you guys know, very operational Valerie, but I've worked with all [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=313.96s)]
*  you guys various times. And what we do is we map the entire system from beginning to end. So we [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=317.56s)]
*  map the system from enumeration. So I get your number all the way to the end, went to the offices [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=322.36s)]
*  and saw the office operate. And in that process, one of our engineers, Peyton, I mentioned, he found [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=326.44s)]
*  the data. So we're looking at all the data enumeration, how it works, what's going on, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=334.04s)]
*  the typical stuff you'd look at. And he found this data called enumeration beyond entry. Right. So [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=337.64s)]
*  it had this giant ramp to it. You can see their baseline was kind of, you know, three, four [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=345.16s)]
*  thousand people all the way up to point one million people. And that just jumped out at [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=348.76s)]
*  what's that. And so we dug into it and that's how this started. And so what that's showing is [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=353.4s)]
*  social security numbers that were issued to non-American citizens or non-citizens. Am I [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=358.52s)]
*  correct that that's the number we're looking at? So these are non-citizens getting security numbers. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=365.4s)]
*  And for people who don't know, just like a little bit of background on the social security system, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=370.03999999999996s)]
*  we do this. This is not abnormal for us to give social security numbers. This is part of the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=374.44s)]
*  process that the government does. The social security number was created in 1936 for citizens [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=380.12s)]
*  to track their earnings. And in the nineties, we started giving them to non-citizens who were [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=385.32s)]
*  authorized to work in the U.S. so that we could collect taxes from them. And so if you are not a [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=391.15999999999997s)]
*  citizen and you're a green card holder, which some people in this program, I think, have been, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=396.92s)]
*  you have to have a social security number in order to work and you pay into social security and [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=402.12s)]
*  Medicare just like U.S. citizens. And then eventually I think you would qualify for those [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=405.96000000000004s)]
*  over some period of time. You can also get a social security number if you're a legal [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=411.40000000000003s)]
*  immigrant into the United States on a visa. So for example, when I first came to the United States [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=416.12s)]
*  25 years ago on a TN visa, I was able to get my social security number because I had a valid [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=420.44000000000005s)]
*  visa to be in the United States. Okay. So we have social security numbers being given to [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=427.16s)]
*  non-citizens. That is not controversial, but there's something controversial about this chart. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=434.28000000000003s)]
*  Antonio, tell us what that is. So I think you'll see there's it starts to like call 300,000 or so. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=438.68s)]
*  This is during the COVID period. Yeah. Coming right out of it. So we, the 21 is coming right [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=444.76000000000005s)]
*  out of COVID, right? So if you go back even a couple of years, 19, you'll see that it's about [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=449.72s)]
*  400,000. Yeah, exactly. Right there. So what happened was this program was designed for, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=454.04s)]
*  so we were talking about, you know, people that got visas, this is at Numerations Beyond Entries [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=461.8s)]
*  after you're in. There are some people in here that have H1Bs, screen cards, et cetera. And the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=466.12s)]
*  way we thought about this was that's the baseline number. That's the three to 400,000 a year you see [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=471.48s)]
*  and that should be happening. That's like, you know, there are programs for Afghans, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=475.96000000000004s)]
*  example, the translators that came in after the war, right? The people who brought it, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=480.04s)]
*  they would be in these kinds of programs. And so the baseline number and by the program goes back, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=482.84s)]
*  this particular program goes back all the way to 17 and it had a legitimate use, which was the kind [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=486.91999999999996s)]
*  of people we were talking about. People that we want to let in, like the care program, I'll make [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=491.23999999999995s)]
*  example, which are the Afghans. They would be in this number. And so what jumped out of this wasn't [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=495.15999999999997s)]
*  that this is here because it has legitimate use. It's that it's the growth. Why did it grow this [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=500.12s)]
*  fast? And what happened? That's what we dug into. Have you figured that out yet? Is it because of [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=505.15999999999997s)]
*  like a COVID overhang that the one criticism I did see of the chart that I wanted to bring up with [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=510.36s)]
*  you is, Hey, people want to see the 10 years, 20 years before this, what would we see if we were [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=514.44s)]
*  looked backwards a little bit? And do you have some theories and is the COVID overhang theory [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=519.0s)]
*  valid? Or is this just Biden opened the border as we saw, you know, especially like, and maybe it [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=523.88s)]
*  was that third year of his term, the 2023 year, and this is the overhang of the 2020 research. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=528.92s)]
*  What are your theories? Well, the answer is no, but can only know because the program really started [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=533.96s)]
*  it. It started in 2017. So they probably worked on it before that, right? If you take a few years, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=539.4s)]
*  put this into place. They worked at it by guesses, you know, back during the administration, it [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=543.88s)]
*  actually became active in 17. You see a few numbers in 18, and it starts to get a little bigger in 19 [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=548.12s)]
*  and 20. Right. So that's how we get this baseline number of 19 and 20. That's where we're using that [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=554.04s)]
*  data here. So there isn't, I can't go back 20 years. It doesn't exist. And then when we dug into it, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=557.9599999999999s)]
*  what we found was the vast majority of the growth was related to asylum programs and parolees. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=564.36s)]
*  I had people that came in on NTAs, this is noticed to appear into the country, either at the border, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=570.52s)]
*  at the airports, mostly at the border. And then we dug further into it, we found that there were, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=575.8000000000001s)]
*  this is about 5.4 million people total. There were about 1.2 million people that the status [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=584.12s)]
*  is marked as unknown and about 1.2 million people that were marked as general parole. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=588.9200000000001s)]
*  And they should have markings of what the program is there under. Because if you claim asylum, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=592.76s)]
*  you're supposed to claim like a real fear. I'm going to be tortured by my country. You know, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=597.96s)]
*  something bad is going to happen to me, so I can't go home. What we find here is that a legitimate [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=601.64s)]
*  program was in the word I use abused. The requirements were super opened so that more [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=606.04s)]
*  people come through. And the example I'll give you, you know, I have here actually the form. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=613.48s)]
*  Used to be going back in time, a four page form that the officer had to fill out in the field. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=618.8399999999999s)]
*  And the person that was claiming asylum had to actually prove that they were had a really [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=624.12s)]
*  credible fear of being, you know, murdered, tortured by their government. That's what the [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=627.8s)]
*  sign is for. It turned into a form, which I can't give you, but I'm going to show you here. If you [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=631.64s)]
*  zoom in on it, it has four questions. That's it. And the four questions are super leading. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=636.28s)]
*  I'll just read the, you know, the like one of the important ones here, right? So, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=640.92s)]
*  do you have any reason for concern about being returned to your home country or being removed [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=645.96s)]
*  from the United States? I mean, could that be more leading? Right. What they did is they open, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=650.6s)]
*  they just opened the aperture on these programs dramatically. So they allowed people that were [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=655.56s)]
*  illegals to the border to come in legally. And as we've dug further into it, we found this took us. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=660.36s)]
*  So you guys know me, Matt. I do like I'm a very methodical lean business process mapper. And we [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=665.8s)]
*  went all the way to the border, literally to Brownsville and Laredo to ask what happened. We [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=672.44s)]
*  couldn't find the data on what these unknown categories were. And it turns out that when the [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=676.6s)]
*  folks at the border who were great, by the way, they're really tried hard and they suffered a lot [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=683.4000000000001s)]
*  in this. This is a bit of, this is a human strategy I've talked about. They were giving people at times [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=687.96s)]
*  notices to appear. This is the NTA. And what that allows you to do is come in the country and then [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=693.08s)]
*  you're scheduled a court date, which is like six years out. So now you're in the country with some [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=700.9200000000001s)]
*  quasi legal status. You're waiting for your court date. And while you're waiting for your court date, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=704.6800000000001s)]
*  which could be six years out as the average, by the way, it could be longer than that. You're [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=708.76s)]
*  waiting for your court date. You could fill out an asylum application. So without even an interview, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=712.84s)]
*  just an application by filing a form. Once the application's in, you can file another form, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=718.0400000000001s)]
*  765, to get a work authorization. Once you get that, you get a 766, which is the authorization. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=723.64s)]
*  And we automatically send you a social security card in the mail, no interview at all. That is [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=729.32s)]
*  the majority of the growth you see in these numbers. Is there any ID verification along the way, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=737.1600000000001s)]
*  Antonio? Like, do we know that there are no duplications happening by validating that one [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=741.5600000000001s)]
*  individual is getting one social security number at any point in this process? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=747.32s)]
*  So it's a great question. No, the answer is there's no real ID verification. So you can, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=751.5600000000001s)]
*  one of the things we found with this was the people that some people showed ID, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=757.16s)]
*  some people didn't. And one of the things- These would be IDs, Antonio, from their home country. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=761.24s)]
*  This would be a Venezuelan driver's license or something. Yeah. I mean, it could be a passport, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=765.9599999999999s)]
*  a driver's license, but here's what really sort of tipped us off and disturbed us. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=769.8s)]
*  When we looked at the birth certificate day that was presented at the border, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=774.76s)]
*  the number one birth date was 1-1. And it was four times more likely to be born on 1-1 [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=778.04s)]
*  than any other day of the year. Now we all know this is a true- [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=782.8399999999999s)]
*  So they just hit enter on that part of the form. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=785.56s)]
*  Or more they had nothing. They could have come, they also could have gone with nothing. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=787.64s)]
*  If you give me nothing- Do we take biometrics of people at the border? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=789.64s)]
*  Do we take like an iris scan, fingerprints, and all that stuff? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=791.7199999999999s)]
*  This is one of the issues. I mean, we do have photos of people. We found that 23% of the records [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=794.68s)]
*  looked at did not have fingerprints. And look, the folks at the border were overwhelmed. And we're [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=799.56s)]
*  not sure why this happened. I will tell you guys just to understand when I went down there, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=806.52s)]
*  both border patrol and border protection told me they had the highest suicide rates [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=810.52s)]
*  of all time during the surge. Okay, over 70 of these agents committed suicide in this period. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=815.08s)]
*  It's truly tragic because they knew what was going on. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=822.28s)]
*  Given the fact that all this has happened, is the Trump administration going to try to [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=824.9200000000001s)]
*  claim the social security numbers back, invalidate them? What will be the proper action? Or is it [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=832.44s)]
*  too late? Are they already sort of in the system and now you can't do anything about it? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=836.6800000000001s)]
*  So Ben, it's a great question, right? And the first question was, what are they doing? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=840.6s)]
*  I mean, you know, like, where are these people? Where are they? How are they? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=845.56s)]
*  And we've gone through a process of mapping this. So we mapped it through to the benefit programs. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=848.6s)]
*  We found in the benefit programs that every benefit program that was being accessed by these [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=853.3199999999999s)]
*  people, you know, 1.3 million of them are on Medicaid right now today. And by the way, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=857.56s)]
*  it's just ramping. It's just starting. Just to figure your point. And then out of curiosity, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=862.6s)]
*  I woke up one night, like two in the morning. I couldn't sleep. My mind was right on this. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=867.0s)]
*  I sent the injured notes saying, hey, guys, let's look at the public voter rolls who we find [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=870.04s)]
*  but in some friendly states. And we looked at voter rolls and we found that thousands of them [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=873.72s)]
*  registered to vote in a handful of states. And then we went even further with those friendly states [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=878.04s)]
*  and found that many of those people had actually voted. It was shocking to us. If I hadn't seen it [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=882.12s)]
*  with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed it. And so now the question we're asking ourselves is, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=886.12s)]
*  what do we do? We referred some to prosecution. That's ongoing right now. You know, we're thinking [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=889.88s)]
*  through how to do it. And the reality is they have various kinds of status and it's a very [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=894.92s)]
*  detailed analysis. Legally, they're working through right now about how to deal with it. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=899.16s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell So thousands of those people registered to vote. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=903.0s)]
*  David Tenenbaum Yes. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=906.68s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell In the election. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=907.9599999999999s)]
*  David Tenenbaum Which is a federal crime, by the way. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=909.0799999999999s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Well, yeah, I mean, the interesting thing is like the Heritage [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=910.76s)]
*  Foundation has a very good project, you know, it's obviously right leaning, where they're studying [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=913.3199999999999s)]
*  all cases of fraud. I looked at it before we're here. There's only been 24 cases since 2003 of [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=917.64s)]
*  David Tenenbaum somebody who's a non citizen trying to vote. Now those are people caught. So [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=922.76s)]
*  this would be incredibly dramatic if it was even 1000 people. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=927.72s)]
*  David Tenenbaum Oh, no, Jason, it's more than 1000. I've seen it. I've seen the data myself. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=930.92s)]
*  And it's more than 1000 in just a couple of states. I mean, it is shockingly bad. And this [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=935.4s)]
*  is the tip of the iceberg guys. It's the tip of the iceberg. It doesn't include the 7.8 million [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=940.04s)]
*  people that ice has that have come in illegally and over here and all the people that came illegally, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=944.92s)]
*  we don't know are here. I mean, this is not a political issue. I want to be really clear about [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=948.92s)]
*  this. Yeah, Antonio, let's just take one step back because I just want you to repeat this. So [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=952.28s)]
*  because I think it's important and we may have just run over it a little too quickly. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=958.4399999999999s)]
*  When you get a social security number, what you're saying is there's all of these important [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=962.68s)]
*  downstream consequences. One of the downstream consequences is you could show up, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=968.68s)]
*  register to vote. And that's an illegitimate action that's breaking federal law. That's one. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=973.48s)]
*  But the second is that without knowing who this person is, they can start to absorb resources [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=979.48s)]
*  that could have otherwise gone to an American. I guess that's like a fundamental part of this. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=987.64s)]
*  Yeah. And so how do you quantify that? Can you just maybe explain it a little bit more about all of [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=993.88s)]
*  the different ways in which you think now, you know, the United States ends up leaking services [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1000.36s)]
*  to these folks? And also they could be contributing to right, they could be paying taxes into the [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1006.76s)]
*  system. And so I guess there's both of those possibilities and both of those have fingerprints [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1010.8399999999999s)]
*  to mouth. So yeah, good question. Yeah, look, we need to figure this out. This is a very, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1015.0s)]
*  it's massively complex. You can see the map I have on the whiteboard in our office. It's huge. And [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1019.9599999999999s)]
*  we're we're figuring it out right now. But let me just tell you this. And every benefit program [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1025.6399999999999s)]
*  looked at, and this is just a handful of states, we found people on all the benefit programs, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1029.48s)]
*  and we find unemployment, we find them on Medicaid. So Jason, to your point, the people [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1033.56s)]
*  on Medicaid and employment, they're not contributing. They're taking out their mooching, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1037.6399999999999s)]
*  right? There are criminals. I mean, look, we sent this data list to the National Targeting Center. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1041.96s)]
*  They I don't want to get too far into the data. But I can tell you, they found hard hits in the [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1046.52s)]
*  target center of very bad people, criminals and people on a terrorist watch list that are in this [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1050.28s)]
*  group. And so yeah, I mean, it's a problem. We got to figure out how to deal with it. And the, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1055.3999999999999s)]
*  of course, there are people that are also, you know, have jobs and paying the system. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1060.36s)]
*  That's been that's that's also true. All these things are true. And we're trying to sort the [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1065.8s)]
*  data and figure out how to actually deal with it. Now, Antonio, one of the things about the data [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1070.12s)]
*  that you triggered, which, because the data is so important, frankly, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1074.52s)]
*  is a lot of people started to try to find a way to nitpick and say, Antonio, you're cherry picking, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1081.1599999999999s)]
*  or Antonio, this is not really representative. And you had some pretty big names, right? People [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1089.16s)]
*  that have credibility, Jim Chaynos, probably being one of the more prolific people, a very well-known [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1094.28s)]
*  hedge fund manager. But I think you tried to articulate why their objections didn't make any [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1100.1200000000001s)]
*  sense. I think it's important to maybe give you a few moments here to identify what they said, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1107.96s)]
*  and maybe debunk it. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1115.0s)]
*  Antonio Santos So the chart that they're using, and you can see this, I posted something on X [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1116.04s)]
*  about this. It was apples to oranges. You can see here, they took a chart that included all [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1120.8400000000001s)]
*  enumerations, not the EB program, the enumeration by an entry program, all enumerations, they [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1127.48s)]
*  compared to our chart. So they put this just to be clear, this would have included somebody like me [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1133.0800000000002s)]
*  coming in on a TN visa or somebody on an EB one visa. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1137.56s)]
*  Jim Chaynos So those people being R-dated too, but just enumerated by entry, the data on the left of [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1142.2s)]
*  2020, the big bars, that includes people in the offices, that include people who got, they got [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1148.28s)]
*  sister numbers because they went to a consulate. And like you probably did, applied ahead of time [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1153.48s)]
*  before they came in, you know, those kinds of people. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1157.32s)]
*  Antonio Santos So we need a stacked bar chart. So there's some fun with numbers going on. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1159.32s)]
*  Jim Chaynos Can you flip back again? So your number for 24 was how much? 2.1 million. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1162.84s)]
*  Antonio Santos Yep. Yep. What they did is took, they took our data. So this was, you know, look, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1168.36s)]
*  I don't want to impute negative motives. They just maybe were confused. They took our data [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1174.04s)]
*  and they added the total data, right? This is just subsection. This is EB. And I'm just going to use [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1179.32s)]
*  the acrobatics. Okay, guys, this is EB only enumeration beyond entry, which is a program, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1185.8s)]
*  as I said, started in 2017. And then it kind of ramped up into 19. They took our data and then [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1190.6s)]
*  they added the total data before that. Right? That is apples to oranges. That's why it doesn't [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1195.72s)]
*  work. And I went through a whole analysis of this on X and you know, the person, the first person [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1201.48s)]
*  that posted the chart actually deleted it and sent me a post saying, hey, you know, I'm deleting it [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1208.1200000000001s)]
*  because I get it. You're right. And apologized and asked me some questions. I don't want to get into [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1212.28s)]
*  it. You guys know, I don't post a lot on X. I don't want to get into base people. It's not worth it. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1216.52s)]
*  Jim Chaynos But there was- [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1220.1200000000001s)]
*  Antonio Santos The data speaks for itself. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1220.44s)]
*  It basically, it basically became like a Rorschach test where people that did not want to believe the [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1221.88s)]
*  points you were making latched on to that chart that was shown even though it was disproven. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1227.24s)]
*  And that became the narrative for a good chunk of the internet and a good chunk of for media [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1233.08s)]
*  responses. Look, you guys know me, you know me for a long time. This is not political, man. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1237.24s)]
*  This is- Tell us about your political background. Again, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1241.72s)]
*  we haven't talked about this on the show, Antonio, but I think it's worth letting everyone hear about [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1243.72s)]
*  your background a little bit. Just so folks understand where you're coming from. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1247.08s)]
*  Antonio Santos I was a Democrat for 20 years. I mean, I, you know, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1251.08s)]
*  I knocked on doors for really Clinton, Iowa. I was, you know, from Illinois. And look, I've [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1253.9599999999998s)]
*  got lots of good friends who are Democrats. And when I explained the state of them, they're shocked [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1260.1999999999998s)]
*  as I am. I don't believe this is- Jim Chaynos I mean, to say you're a Democrat is an understatement. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1263.56s)]
*  You were a major donor and a majorly involved with the Democratic Party. Ben, you tend to call balls [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1268.1999999999998s)]
*  and strikes on the program. What are your thoughts on immigration generally and how it should work [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1275.0s)]
*  here in the US and how maybe we can resolve this and get to- Antonio, I want your answer to that [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1281.48s)]
*  question as well- maybe some reconciliation here between the moderates, MAGA, original, you know, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1286.2s)]
*  classic GOP, Democrats, and the woke lunatics. Like, is there any way out of this? And maybe [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1293.0s)]
*  perhaps what we're seeing here with somebody like Antonio, who is a lifelong Democrat, who now [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1300.04s)]
*  is, you know, helping the government, maybe there's some way with data and logic we can get [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1304.92s)]
*  through this. I mean, I think that what Antonio is doing here is so important specifically for that, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1309.24s)]
*  because it seems to me there's actually been a fairly wide consensus among the American population [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1315.0800000000002s)]
*  for a very long time what to do about immigration, particularly the southern border, which is number [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1319.5600000000002s)]
*  one, just stop the illegal immigration at the southern border. After Biden blew that out, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1323.0800000000002s)]
*  a lot of Democrats turned to President Trump specifically because of that issue. And that has [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1326.76s)]
*  been the signal success of the Trump administration among all the other successes. The number of [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1330.6000000000001s)]
*  the border have just plummeted to almost zero. I mean, the lowest numbers in recorded history, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1334.84s)]
*  and that is an unmitigated success. And then I think everybody knows that we have to sort of [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1338.6s)]
*  figure out who gets to stay and who gets to go, who's already in the country and what Antonio is [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1342.36s)]
*  doing by being able to discern who is here and is a net draw on the resources of the American people [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1345.3999999999999s)]
*  versus maybe who is a net taxpayer or who's actually contributing, who's a criminal, right? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1351.1599999999999s)]
*  There's always been this bizarre supposition in the political realm that there's no way on a one-to-one [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1355.8799999999999s)]
*  level to figure out who is who. You have to treat everybody as a class, everybody stays, everybody [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1360.6799999999998s)]
*  goes. And the reality is that even the way the Trump administration is doing this by first [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1364.6s)]
*  targeting, say, criminal illegal aliens for removal, and then maybe moving on to people [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1368.52s)]
*  who are net drawn resources who came in falsely under claims of asylum and now are receiving [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1372.76s)]
*  Medicaid or disability. I've made the argument for, I think, my entire career actually on this, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1377.0s)]
*  that we should be treating immigrants, illegal immigrants who are in the country, the same way [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1382.4399999999998s)]
*  we would treat people who are trying to get into the country, which is to say, are you going to [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1386.04s)]
*  benefit the United States or you're not going to benefit the United States? And the counterargument [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1389.8s)]
*  was always, well, how exactly are you going to determine who is who? And the answer I always [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1392.6s)]
*  gave was, well, the IRS does it with our tax returns literally every single year, so why should [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1397.08s)]
*  we not be able to do that? And so the kind of work Antonia is doing, showing you actually can do that [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1401.32s)]
*  by tracking the social security numbers of people who came in illegally, because the truth of the [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1404.76s)]
*  number of unknown getaways is actually really, really small compared to this. It's a small number. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1410.04s)]
*  Most of the people who are coming across the border, at least during the Biden term, I went [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1415.48s)]
*  down to the border last year and visited a Native American reservation that's right along [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1418.44s)]
*  the border where the border patrol basically was not. And they said that what was happening is [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1422.6000000000001s)]
*  people arriving at the border, they were doing exactly what Antonia was talking about. They would [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1427.48s)]
*  literally say, I fear to go back to my home country. They'd be processed. They'd be led into the [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1430.52s)]
*  country with a future date to come back. And that was all happening within 72 hours. So being able [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1434.04s)]
*  to track those people and find out who should be in, who shouldn't be, that's huge. And I think [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1439.4s)]
*  that's the consensus. So should we, are you in the camp? We should deport everybody, this sort of [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1444.84s)]
*  Stephen Miller, deport 20 million people, Ben? Or are you in the, hey, let's get rid of the criminals [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1451.0s)]
*  and that will get us to where we need to be. Well, I don't think it's just the criminals. I [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1457.0s)]
*  mean, I think you also need to go after the folks who are here to take advantage of the welfare [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1460.84s)]
*  benefits, for example, or just draw on the system. But I don't think that the number is 20 million. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1465.24s)]
*  I don't think President Trump actually thinks the number is 20 million. I don't think anybody [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1469.72s)]
*  realistically thinks the number is 20 million. Got it. Okay. They said it over and over again, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1473.48s)]
*  all 20 million are going and it's like, it's just marketing. Yes, it's a political campaign and [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1477.48s)]
*  people say that sort of stuff all the time. Antonio, let's talk maybe about reconciliation [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1482.68s)]
*  here. You spent your life as a Democrat and now you've spent, I don't know, six months as a [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1487.8s)]
*  Republican here and helping this administration. How do we get the country to sort of get back [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1492.44s)]
*  together here and maybe reconcile on this issue? Because it seems like an unnecessary to Ben's [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1497.8799999999999s)]
*  point. I think the number is 80% of people believe the border should be just shut, period, full stop [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1503.8799999999999s)]
*  and everything should be legal. And I don't know the other 20 if they're just don't know how to [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1509.72s)]
*  take a survey. I've never met anybody who said there should be an open border at the southern [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1513.08s)]

*  Clinton Democrat, fiscally conservative, socially liberal, correct me if I'm wrong there. What are [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1522.84s)]
*  your thoughts on reconciliation here? Because you really do care about that. Your parents, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1527.72s)]
*  both immigrants, my besties here, three of the four people who host this program, immigrants, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1532.84s)]
*  this is an immigrant country built by immigrants for immigrants has always been. So how do we [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1538.28s)]
*  reconcile this issue and put it behind us? And just I had asked myself this question, and I think [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1543.8799999999999s)]
*  we got to follow the truth. And that's the point follow the truth and the truth is in the data. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1549.56s)]
*  And as Ben said, the numbers don't lie. Right. And so people are productive, we got to find a way to [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1554.52s)]
*  allow them to be productive and stay. People that are taking the system should not be allowed to [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1559.1599999999999s)]
*  stay. And I think we don't want to get into the policy at all, because it's above my pay grade. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1563.08s)]
*  I mean, the reality is for me, my remit is, as Ben said, it's criminals, terrorists, and then [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1566.9199999999998s)]
*  people who have the system and then a political question needs to be answered about what happens [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1572.04s)]
*  to the rest of those people. I don't know. It's not my remit. Free birth. I will say this. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1575.96s)]
*  I think that all my friends who are still Democrats that I have been able to explain this data to, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1582.68s)]
*  they all say the same thing you guys are saying. Man, this is a problem. We've got to figure this [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1587.0s)]
*  out. And let me tell you why. The bigger problem, the biggest problem here, and it's definitely [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1590.6000000000001s)]
*  is taking off the system. But you've got to realize we gave 13 to 15 billion dollars a year [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1595.32s)]
*  to human traffickers. That's what this system did. And the money magnet that attracted these [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1600.04s)]
*  people here, it wasn't like it was some crisis, you know, environmental crisis. The money magnet [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1604.92s)]
*  attracted these people and many of them died on the way up. I mean, think about what that's like. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1609.88s)]
*  Think about the human crisis. So this is a human suffering, the human rights tragedy. You have [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1614.1200000000001s)]
*  people who are getting sold into slavery and being abused at the border. At a minimum, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1618.04s)]
*  every American should be against that. Everyone is. Every American is. Look, man, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1623.5600000000002s)]
*  this turned my stomach when I went to the border and I heard the stories. It turned my stomach, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1626.8400000000001s)]
*  man. We are America. OK, we protect people like this. We don't give incentives to people [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1630.52s)]
*  to pay traffickers. If you pay 20,000, I heard 20,000 to 500 bucks to cross the border. Twenty [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1636.36s)]
*  thousand dollars. I mean, where does someone who's coming from Central America or Africa get 20 grand [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1641.48s)]
*  to pay the pay the traffickers that are walking across the border? It's not free to walk up Mexico. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1645.96s)]
*  OK, it's controlled by the cartels. What happens? I mean, they got to pay that back. How do they pay [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1650.6s)]
*  it back? They're basically dead. It's terrible. This isn't what we do in this country. Right. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1655.0s)]
*  This country is about freedom and we are here to protect it. We protect it around the world, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1659.64s)]
*  protect in our home country. And I don't think any American that I know, none of Democrats, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1663.4s)]
*  Republicans or anyone thinks this is good. It's not good. It's bad for America and it's evil [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1667.8000000000002s)]
*  behavior. We shouldn't send it. We shouldn't. We shouldn't give people a reason to do it. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1672.2s)]
*  We should find legal ways to come in the country. And I think that's what we're going to do. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1675.72s)]
*  Do you believe that there is a Democratic Party motive to increase voter base for the Democrats [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1679.8000000000002s)]
*  behind all of this, as has been proclaimed by some? Look, as I go through the data and I see [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1685.72s)]
*  it's all about the data. David, I know you love the data. When you have just a handful of states, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1691.72s)]
*  man, I'm talking about four states. We looked at the voter rolls. We found these people, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1698.12s)]
*  thousands of them on the voter rolls, and we found many of those people had voted. Right. In one [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1702.04s)]
*  state in particular, well over a thousand voted. Yeah, I think this was a move to import voters. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1706.6s)]
*  But really importantly, I just want to make sure because when I talk to politicians from [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1712.28s)]
*  the Democratic Party about this, they say there's aspects of human rights doing the right thing for [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1716.84s)]
*  people in need that is motivating some of this behavior. Is that a lie? And they actually have [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1723.32s)]
*  a different motive? Or do some in the party think that way, but there are real kind of, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1731.24s)]
*  kind of call it a small group of highly influential folks at the top of the Democratic Party [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1737.0s)]
*  recognize that this is going to grow the voter base and they're kind of motivating this. What [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1742.76s)]
*  do you think is the construction of what sounds to some to be a conspiracy and how much of this [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1746.52s)]
*  is really like widely understood? Look, Ben, I'll tell you what I have seen. I've told you the actual [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1752.04s)]
*  information. If you look at social administration, we set all the defaults to kind of max open, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1758.44s)]
*  no ID requirements, right? You get a social number before we got here by walking in office, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1764.36s)]
*  answering with a medical record and a school ID that had your name and your date of birth on it. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1769.64s)]
*  That's it. Okay. We opened up, we set the defaults to open on social security. We set the defaults [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1777.3200000000002s)]
*  to open on pay, paying people out. And we set the collections defaults basically to zero. So that's [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1783.16s)]
*  how the system looks. I'm just reporting the facts. Do I think that the average person is a Democrat [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1788.92s)]
*  in Illinois or the guys I knew at Chicago, they know this, they don't know this. They don't know [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1796.28s)]
*  this. So were there people at the top of the system did this? Yeah. People created this policy. The [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1802.6s)]
*  former administrators of these agencies created these policies. I've seen them. I've read them [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1807.3999999999999s)]
*  myself. I've gone to the data myself. They've seen them. Now this isn't everybody. If you're the [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1811.72s)]
*  average person out there who's a Democrat and you see what I've seen, I believe you will conclude [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1816.44s)]
*  I concluded, which is this isn't right. These policies are wrong. They're evil. They're wrong. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1823.0s)]
*  We gave an incentive for people to get trafficked. That's terrible. I just don't think people know. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1828.2s)]
*  The reason I'm even willing to do all, you guys know me, I'm pretty private. I come on your [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1832.3600000000001s)]
*  podcast because we're buddies. But like, man, the reason I'm talking about this is not political. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1835.5600000000002s)]
*  It's because it's a human rights issue and the human rights issue is being confused. It's not, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1840.6000000000001s)]
*  we are incenting people to pay traffickers to come to America. We were doing this, right? We got to [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1844.44s)]
*  find better ways to do that. And I just, I don't believe any American, the 80% of people Jason's [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1850.36s)]
*  talking about that would say close the border. That's the 80% who are coming here on this issue. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1854.36s)]
*  Antonio. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1858.4399999999998s)]
*  Man, we got to take care of people. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1858.9199999999998s)]
*  Antonio, can you talk about what the next big push of effort from you and your team will be? Is there [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1860.76s)]
*  some next chart? I'm not trying to be reductive, but is there something that you can demonstrate [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1867.3999999999999s)]
*  that is going to be equivalently as powerful as this first chart, which then helps us start to [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1872.84s)]
*  move these gears towards doing the logical and right thing? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1880.12s)]
*  Antonio I think the right thing is to figure out who's who, right? Who are the criminals, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1882.9199999999998s)]
*  who are the terrorists? Number one. And number two, who's mooching off the system? And then number [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1887.32s)]
*  three, the people that are working that Jason's talking about, what we do with them. That's the [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1893.3999999999999s)]
*  right answer. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1898.36s)]
*  I would add a fourth because I think that there's probably no more electric issue than this idea of [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1898.92s)]
*  voting in propriety. And I think it has become so brazenly partisan that everybody has suspended [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1909.08s)]
*  logic. If it turns out that there was a manipulated effort in 2020, and there is even a thread of [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1915.56s)]
*  legitimacy to Trump's claims, you would never be able to see the light of day because so many of [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1922.92s)]
*  Americans just turn off, right? And that's because of the rhetoric that they've been fed. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1928.52s)]
*  This is a really important thing that I would just offer to you is that if it is true that these [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1933.8s)]
*  people illegally voted, I think it's a thunderclap. And I think it opens wide the aperture on voting [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1940.28s)]
*  illegality and voting reform. And I think that irrespective of who you are, you should want to [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1948.2s)]
*  make sure that people who are not allowed to vote are not voting, just to put it simply. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1954.44s)]
*  Yeah. Wow. What an incredible concept. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1960.8400000000001s)]
*  It's amazing. I can't get an airplane in America without ID, but I can go vote in some states that [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1963.3200000000002s)]
*  ID. I think that's crazy. I think it's totally crazy. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1969.4s)]
*  That is crazy. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1972.04s)]
*  And we're down to like, Ben, you know the number, it's 15 states now are the ones that don't have [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1972.6000000000001s)]
*  voter ID. So this is becoming like a very obvious issue in the loop for us to close. I think the [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1977.3200000000002s)]
*  best next thing for you to do is actually publish this list of people who voted, get it to the [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1981.8s)]
*  Heritage Foundation and put sunlight on it. The truth shall make you free and sunlight is the [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1985.6399999999999s)]
*  best disinfectant because I think the whole issue is absurd. Because if you look at the votes in [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1989.72s)]
*  the swing states, it would take 100,000, it would take tens of thousands and it's illegal. I've [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=1996.84s)]
*  spoken to the person at the Heritage Foundation who does this. They found like 2400 cases over [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2002.12s)]
*  40 or 50 years. The number of people voting illegally is minuscule in order to swing even [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2008.28s)]
*  but one state. You would need a coordinated effort. Hold on, let me finish. You would need [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2014.52s)]
*  a coordinated effort. I'm just giving you data, Chema. I am not partisan. There are tens of [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2019.16s)]
*  thousands of votes that would need to be manipulated in each of these markets. It's impossible. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2024.52s)]
*  There's the key word. Here's what I would ask you to consider. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2029.56s)]
*  Sure. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2033.32s)]
*  Your results are only as good as your prompt. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2033.6399999999999s)]
*  Your results are only as good as your prompt. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2038.76s)]
*  Say it in plain English. What do you mean? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2041.8s)]
*  I suspect that if you put three or four of the smartest data scientists in the world, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2044.2s)]
*  they would get to a very different answer than the answer that has been arrived to. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2050.44s)]
*  I don't know whether that will validate or invalidate the claim. But the quality of the [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2053.88s)]
*  people that are able to interrogate this data is directly correlated to the output that is created. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2059.08s)]
*  Well, listen, we all want the data clean. Ben, maybe I'll let you kind of answer the question [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2065.3999999999996s)]
*  from your perspective. Do you think there is any chance that a swing state could be swung by, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2069.72s)]
*  you know, this strategy? And in addition to that, Trump is a populist. All these people, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2076.9199999999996s)]
*  and his biggest gains were with people from South America, Mexicans, etc. in this last election. So [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2081.8799999999997s)]
*  non-college educated. So if you were going to plot this incredible strategy, it seems like the [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2088.3599999999997s)]
*  democratic strategy of importing a bunch of voters is the stupidest possible strategy [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2093.08s)]
*  because the Republican Party has won those people. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2097.4s)]
*  Well, I don't think that it would be a great short term strategy because of the problems [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2100.12s)]
*  that you mentioned in terms of the size of the voting gaps, even in close swing states, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2103.7999999999997s)]
*  although obviously you have outlier cases like Florida in 2000, where the entire state is being [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2107.0s)]
*  decided by hundreds of votes. And there you actually could see a state actually shift on [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2110.68s)]
*  that basis. It's a rarity, but it does happen. And in some cases, besides a presidential election. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2115.3199999999997s)]
*  When you're talking, however, about the long term play, I think the question that needs to be asked [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2120.52s)]
*  is if you are importing a bunch of people who are more dependent than average on the American [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2124.76s)]
*  government, for example, or who are not interested in assimilating to free market values, for example, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2129.48s)]
*  or free speech values, or who come in, and then many of these people are going to get married, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2135.0800000000004s)]
*  many of these people are going to have kids, they're going to marry American citizens, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2139.96s)]
*  they're going to have children who are American, and then they stay. Now you're talking about [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2142.28s)]
*  actually generating a change in the voting population. And that isn't a right wing point. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2145.7200000000003s)]
*  That's a point that was made by Roy Tashara all the way back in 2004, when he was a Democrat, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2148.76s)]
*  and he was making the case, essentially, there was a demographic wave that was going to shift [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2152.6800000000003s)]
*  the electorate in the United States in the direction of Democrats permanently. Now, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2156.2000000000003s)]
*  the point that you're making is that even as a long term strategy, that might be a bad play, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2160.0400000000004s)]
*  because it may be that these populations shift over time. That doesn't mean that that's not [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2163.7200000000003s)]
*  the intent in the moment. Meaning maybe they're wrong. Right. They could have gotten it wrong. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2167.4s)]
*  Right. Exactly. It could have been a very bad strategic decision. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2171.5600000000004s)]
*  Antonio, I think we have to drop you off here. Any closing comments you want to make, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2174.44s)]
*  and I just want to thank you. I know you've got other things you could be doing in your life, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2178.04s)]
*  but just on behalf of the American people who I speak for here on the program, we want to thank [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2182.76s)]
*  you all Americans for your service to this country. And I know that you are balls and strikes, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2187.64s)]
*  and you're going to let the data speak. So I just want to thank you. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2192.68s)]
*  Close this conversation, which is go to California, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2197.8s)]
*  Louis, California. Okay. Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, him California, Ronald Reagan signed [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2201.64s)]
*  Amnesty. And some 40 years later, it is now a solid blue state. And I think some of us on this [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2207.96s)]
*  program, I know you, Jason, are a refugee from California because of that, because of some of [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2215.08s)]
*  those policies. And I want you to be careful about this, because it is actually the tip of the [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2219.32s)]
*  iceberg. We have a very small sample of data in a couple of states. It's the tip of the iceberg. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2224.36s)]
*  And so I don't know what the unintended consequences will be long term, but I tell you, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2231.0s)]
*  what's already happened in America, where an Amnesty program actually turned a very large state, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2234.2000000000003s)]
*  from one party to another. And I want to leave you guys with this thought. This is not political. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2240.52s)]
*  I'm not doing it. There's no political motivation in my mind. This is about America. It's about [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2245.64s)]
*  securing the American democracy. And we will shine light onto the data when we can. We prefer these [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2249.4s)]
*  people to prosecution, and we're going to keep looking. We'll keep going and the data will lead [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2255.4s)]
*  us and the truth will lead us and eventually come out in the sunlight. You're right. But we're [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2260.04s)]
*  going to follow the truth. That's our primary motive. That is our operating parameter and what [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2264.12s)]
*  we're going to do. Right on. All right. Thank you, Antonio. Graces and continued success. And [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2270.68s)]
*  I'd love to talk to you in 30, 60 days when you have your next findings. Thanks, guys. Thank you. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2275.88s)]
*  And you're a refugee from California too, aren't you? Yes. Yeah. We took off in 2020 during COVID. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2280.84s)]
*  We took off. My company took off. We all got the hell out. I was born in California. So I spent [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2286.84s)]
*  36 years there before I moved. And yeah, they certainly did a good job of wrecking that state. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2291.96s)]
*  I mean, I did the same thing. You went to... Oh, I don't know if you can talk about where you... [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2298.04s)]
*  I'm in Florida. Yeah, my company's in Tennessee. I'm in Florida. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2302.36s)]
*  Yeah, got it. Yeah. I mean, it's just... You can't raise kids in California and just think about the [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2304.6800000000003s)]
*  crime and taxes and what you're getting for your dollar. It doesn't make any sense. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2309.7200000000003s)]
*  White House is off the Zoom, boys. Now we can start to open it up. Okay. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2314.6s)]
*  Now we can open up the aperture. No more foyer. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2318.52s)]
*  All right. Okay. What do you guys think about what you just saw? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2321.3199999999997s)]
*  Ben, I'll let you go first as our guest. I wish the entire Trump administration were rolled [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2326.12s)]
*  out as well as Antonio just rolled that out, is what I would say. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2330.04s)]
*  Totally. I think that that is high levels of competence and expertise and a meticulous [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2332.9199999999996s)]
*  message that is data first and difficult for anybody to deny. I think that the success of [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2339.24s)]
*  the Trump administration, the success that they've had are taking the 80 side of 80-20 issues. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2343.8799999999997s)]
*  And I think that the success of President Trump in 2024 was that he oddly became the [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2347.9599999999996s)]
*  normie candidate. He was the guy who was returned to normalcy candidacy in the face of Biden and [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2351.72s)]
*  the bizarreness of Harris. And I think that as we see many of Trump's policies rolled out, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2356.2799999999997s)]
*  the ones that are rolled out the way that Antonio is rolling it out are incredibly well received by [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2362.52s)]
*  the American population because they're seeing serious people doing serious work that needs to [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2367.16s)]
*  be done. And the ones that are not rolled out that way, I think are going to be a little more [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2370.6s)]
*  unpopular with the American people. And that's kind of, I want President Trump to succeed in a [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2374.04s)]
*  lot of these agenda items and I don't want his good agenda items getting essentially railroaded [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2377.96s)]
*  and run over by the bad roll out of other agenda items. So you think thoughtful is good [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2383.56s)]
*  and well thought out, constructed and communicated. What, when you talk about this being done [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2390.3599999999997s)]
*  right, what do you think is being done wrong? It could be done better, I guess, would be a [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2396.92s)]
*  generous way of saying it. What could they communicate better? I mean, not to jump into [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2400.36s)]
*  the pile of rakes that is the tariff plan, but I think that the way that the tariff plan was rolled [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2403.88s)]
*  out is about as bad a roll out as you could do. The reason I say that is not just because of my [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2409.4s)]
*  disagreements on the actual policy. I'll either be right or I'll be wrong on that. But the way [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2414.6s)]
*  that it was rolled out with essentially kind of a surprise announcement, I don't mind a surprise [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2418.6800000000003s)]
*  announcement if what is then rolled out is not replete with sort of contradictory justifications, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2424.44s)]
*  statistics that are labeled one thing but really are not that thing. And so it opens itself up to [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2431.56s)]
*  all sorts of critiques from every possible side of the aisle. If you want to make the argument, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2437.64s)]
*  make the full scale well thought argument and then we can argue over whether it's true or not. But [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2441.48s)]
*  there's four or five different claims that are being simultaneously made about the tariffs. One, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2447.08s)]
*  they're going to raise revenue. Two, they're going to reshore. Three, that you are going to [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2451.24s)]
*  somehow rejigger the world trading system. Some of these are mutually exclusive. If you're going to [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2455.24s)]
*  reshore, you're not going to raise as much revenue, for example. Those two things are mutually [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2460.7599999999998s)]
*  exclusive and they're both being trotted out at the same exact time. If you're going to put out [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2464.6s)]
*  a giant chart that the president holds up that shows tariff rates plus unspecified variable, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2468.2s)]
*  then what I'd like to know is what the actual tariff rate is as opposed to what the calculation [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2475.0s)]
*  seems to be, which was the trade deficit with a country divided into the imports to that country. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2480.92s)]
*  That has nothing to do with the tariff rate. I mean, just technically speaking, it has literally [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2487.64s)]
*  nothing to do with the tariff rate. And so what that means is now you're boxed in logically. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2490.76s)]
*  If President Trump wants to do a reciprocal tariff reduction, for example, how do you do that? Because [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2494.52s)]
*  he actually has used a statistic for the tariffs that have nothing to do with the tariff rate and [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2499.32s)]
*  are actually just trade deficits. So the only way to actually rectify that statistic is to have [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2504.52s)]
*  Madagascar buy a bunch of American product, for example, in order to get their quote unquote [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2508.76s)]
*  tariff rate down. That sort of stuff seems badly calibrated, even if you like the policy, for example. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2512.6800000000003s)]
*  Unless from a poker point of view, they spent many months declaring they're going to do tariffs. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2519.8s)]
*  And everyone thought they were bluffing and said everyone said there's no way you're going to do [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2524.6000000000004s)]
*  tariffs. It's like someone in poker saying, I'm going to play every hand I get. I'm going to be [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2527.8s)]
*  crazy. You don't believe them. And they actually have to do it in order to get the negotiating [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2531.4s)]
*  leverage that they need to be able to negotiate trade deals ultimately. And they have to look a [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2536.84s)]
*  little crazy, maybe. I mean, that's- So that's your position, Freiburg? They're in the 4D chess or- [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2541.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm trying to rationalize one kind of rational reason for why a lot of smart people would end [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2546.92s)]
*  up putting that board up, that poster board up. Where to your point, Ben, they said that these are [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2551.88s)]
*  kind of the tariffs that are being levied upon our country when in fact it is simply the math of [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2556.52s)]
*  imports minus exports divided by imports. That's what the number was. And it was [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2563.2400000000002s)]
*  maxed out at that number or 10%. And that's what they did. So they did that basically as a way, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2568.6800000000003s)]
*  in my opinion, it looks like, and I'm just trying to take a read on this, that they're using this [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2574.28s)]
*  as a way to anchor for negotiations going forward to make the case we are declaratively, crazily, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2579.7200000000003s)]
*  off the frigging ship, going to do whatever the heck we want to do here in this administration. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2586.1200000000003s)]
*  Now everyone takes them seriously. Now everyone shows up to the negotiating table, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2590.68s)]
*  and now they can actually negotiate and then announce a series of win after win after win and [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2595.16s)]
*  say, we got this set of countries to capitulate today. This is the deal we worked out. It's a [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2599.48s)]
*  totally unique deal. This set of deals we worked out today, this set of deals we worked out today, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2603.96s)]
*  and basically getting all the trade representatives to the table by making the case that they're [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2608.12s)]
*  actually willing to go all the way to the wall on stuff. So that's the only way I can kind of [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2612.52s)]
*  rationalize this rollout, Ben. That's what it feels like to me. For months, they've been very [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2616.36s)]
*  declarative. We are going to do tariffs. Besant said it to us on our interview. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2620.92s)]
*  Lutnik said it to us in our interview, and no one took them seriously. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2626.52s)]
*  I did. I did, by the way. I will say that I took them totally seriously so much so that I called [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2629.4s)]
*  my financial advisor after the State of the Union address and told them to rejigger my stock and [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2633.0800000000004s)]
*  bond ratio in my portfolio because I figured that something like this was going to happen. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2638.36s)]
*  You went heavy treasuries. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2642.2000000000003s)]
*  Yes, I went light stocks. I'll say that. And the reason for that is because, again, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2643.72s)]
*  I think that the thing about President Trump is that he may not be serious in every single [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2650.3599999999997s)]
*  thing that he says, but he is very clear that when he says a thing over and over and over, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2656.8399999999997s)]
*  there is no hidden motivation. And this is the part that I always have trouble with, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2661.08s)]
*  with sort of the 40 chess reads on President Trump. There's almost never a hidden motivation. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2664.52s)]
*  He pretty much just says the thing that he thinks, right? It's one of the things that makes him so [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2668.7599999999998s)]
*  popular and authentic is that there isn't a 40 chess game being played. If he says that he [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2671.88s)]
*  wants a thing to happen, it's because he actually wants the thing to happen. Now, the thing about [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2677.08s)]
*  President Trump, he's also a realist. So if a bunch of bad headlines hit him, he may then change [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2680.6s)]
*  his mind and decide that he wants to drive a truck directly through the center of the tariffs [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2684.28s)]
*  because the prices are going up too much on, for example, semiconductors. So one of the big [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2688.12s)]
*  exemptions from these tariffs is, in fact, in the area of semiconductors. Again, there you see a [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2691.7200000000003s)]
*  sort of couple of different justifications that are mutually exclusive that are fighting each [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2695.88s)]
*  other. One of them is the idea we need to reshore semiconductor production because it's a national [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2700.2s)]
*  security asset. And the other is it's we need to raise revenue on semiconductors. So he exempted [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2703.64s)]
*  them, which kind of, you know, kind of bollocks us up the logic. And I think that the there are [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2709.24s)]
*  a couple of tells that that isn't what's happening. It may listen, I think it may end up being the [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2714.68s)]
*  thing you're saying. I think the most likely result of these tariffs is that within the next few [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2718.2799999999997s)]
*  weeks, the headlines are not good. President Trump starts driving trucks through the center of the [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2722.04s)]
*  tariffs and then he starts getting wins from various parties outside that allow him to find [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2725.8s)]
*  an off ramp on some of these tariffs. Now, a company in in Belgium says they're going to build [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2731.2400000000002s)]
*  a factory in the United States. He has them to the White House. They have a big ceremony. And then [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2736.2000000000003s)]
*  he says, and as a result of this, we're now lowering the tariffs in sort of the same way he [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2739.8s)]
*  did with with Colombia when he said not the university, the country when he said he was [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2742.6800000000003s)]
*  going to hit them with tariffs unless you accept these these illegal immigrants. And then they did. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2746.1200000000003s)]
*  So that very well might be the I don't think that's what's going on right now. I think what's [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2750.44s)]
*  going on right now is the strategy that Lutnik has repeatedly expressed, which is that they [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2753.72s)]
*  actually kind of like the tariffs. They actually think that this is good economic policy and that [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2758.52s)]
*  between 1880 and 1910 was an amazing time in American history. And and so they agree. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2761.48s)]
*  I think that that is a bad read on economic history because there are a lot of confounds [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2768.2799999999997s)]
*  there that are being ignored. Among those confounds would be the fact that actually [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2773.7999999999997s)]
*  revolution. Yes. So a few just just to name a few in the industrial revolution, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2778.68s)]
*  extraordinarily high levels of immigration, by the way, during that period. So you had an [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2782.84s)]
*  incredibly cheap labor base that was actually coming in into the United States at that time, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2786.44s)]
*  massive expansion, no American population, no income tax, so capital, a newly discovered continent, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2790.6000000000004s)]
*  right? Like like like truly like many, many confounds. And by the way, less international [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2797.08s)]
*  trade generally. So tariffs aren't going to have the same sort of impact on global supply chains [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2801.6400000000003s)]
*  as they would now, where every product that you buy has gone through 10 different countries in [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2805.4s)]
*  10 different ways. And so I know I don't think that that is a comp, but that doesn't mean that [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2809.32s)]
*  Lutnick doesn't think that it's a comp, for example. And I think that when it comes to [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2814.52s)]
*  the rollout, again, a methodical rollout, I totally get the crazy man theory. And I think [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2819.88s)]
*  that sometimes President Trump does that. I'm hoping that that's what he's doing. But a good [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2825.48s)]
*  example of an offer he could have taken if that's the thing he's trying to do. So yesterday, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2829.8s)]
*  in anticipation of this, Israel, which had very, very low tariffs on United States goods anyway, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2833.7200000000003s)]
*  announced they'd removed all tariffs on American goods, right? There were no tariffs on American [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2837.96s)]
*  goods anymore. And the administration that afternoon listed their tariff rate at 33%. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2841.4s)]
*  And then hit them with a 17% tariff for a country that is just taking a win and just use them as an [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2847.08s)]
*  example of a great partner. Exactly. Exactly. I think that didn't kid didn't Canada do the same [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2852.6s)]
*  didn't Canada drop tariffs like the morning of CNBC and they said we're totally willing to go to [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2857.16s)]
*  zero and then the anchors correctly on CNBC were like, well, then why haven't you done that already [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2862.6s)]
*  to Ben's point, Israel did do that. And but I think your theory, Ben is like, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2867.4s)]
*  absolutely correct. If you make this analogy to what he did with overturning Roe v. Wade, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2872.2000000000003s)]
*  it is the same exact thing he told us over and over again, I'm going to put two maybe three people [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2877.4s)]
*  on the Supreme Court, I'm going to overturn it. And then afterwards, he kind of wiped his hands [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2882.6800000000003s)]
*  through it and was like, listen, it's up to you guys, I had nothing to do with it. He will tell [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2886.76s)]
*  you what he's going to do. He told you he was going to do these tariffs. He's done them. And I do think [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2890.44s)]
*  there's something embedded in what you said, Ben, which is I think he likes everybody to come to [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2895.24s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago or to come to the White House. And he loves doing deals. He's addicted to it. He wrote [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2899.8799999999997s)]
*  a book The Art of the Deal. He loves people coming to him hanging out. And Shemak, maybe you could [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2904.6s)]
*  give us your perspective, crazy man theory, crazy grandpa. Or this is a negotiating tactic, everybody [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2910.3599999999997s)]
*  has to come through him or Lutnick believes it, as he said, very clearly, I'm going to add a [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2917.64s)]
*  trillion dollars in taxes here. What do you think is going on here? Because if when I went through [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2923.56s)]
*  all the top people on the internet, all our group of friends, who are deeply in finance, I can't [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2928.7599999999998s)]
*  find anybody deeply in finance, who's not in the administration who thinks this is well executed [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2934.12s)]
*  or a good idea. What's your thought? Let me start by saying a couple things. To use the [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2938.84s)]
*  Donald Rumsfeld code. I do agree with Ben tremendously that this was a known known. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2943.32s)]
*  We mentioned this last episode. Donald Trump has been speaking about tariffs for 40 plus years. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2949.08s)]
*  So this is not a new thing. And I think that he tried this in Trump one. But to your guys' point, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2956.2799999999997s)]
*  it didn't really go well because he didn't have the team around him that had his back. And so it [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2964.6s)]
*  was inevitable that he would have tried it in Trump too. He said it and he's been able to do it. So [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2969.96s)]
*  if you weren't planning for it, whoever was vested in this outcome, you really needed to be [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2976.76s)]
*  focused on this. It was a known known. And so there was a little dereliction of duty if you [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2983.8s)]
*  were caught off guard, I think. That's one. The second is, and we've said this all year [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2987.8s)]
*  since January 1 on this pod, we started it even with that polymarket bet that I made, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2994.04s)]
*  which is the Trump administration does not care about the stock market. And by the way, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=2999.96s)]
*  the trade actually closed out. So congrats to all these people that won $650,000 on Polymarket. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3008.12s)]
*  Let me just explain. Polymarket put a betting market suggested by Chamath Polyhumpeteer. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3012.84s)]
*  They are partners of ours. Magnificent seven shrinks below 30% of S&P 500 in 2025. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3017.56s)]
*  This was free money. This was like the stock market giving out free money. But why did this [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3024.6s)]
*  happen? This happened because it was very clear to me early on that the rhetoric had shifted to say [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3029.32s)]
*  we care about MAGA. We care about people that have working class and middle class jobs. None of those [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3036.6800000000003s)]
*  folks are deeply invested in the asset economy the way maybe some of us are. And so it was [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3044.52s)]
*  directionally clear. And by the way, Scott Besson, what a cold ass quote yesterday. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3050.76s)]
*  The equity market sell off is a MAG 7 problem, not a MAGA problem. So there again, putting [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3057.1600000000003s)]
*  all of this into the realm of this is a known known. So I think it's pretty clear. One, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3064.92s)]
*  Trump has had a 40 year view on tariffs. They're going to go through with this and they're going [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3069.88s)]
*  to see it through. I don't think you're going to see this grand capitulation. Two, they are [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3074.1200000000003s)]
*  okay with the volatility in the equity markets. And then three, which is the other thing that [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3079.7200000000003s)]
*  we've been talking about a lot is where does this move our practical financing costs? What is this? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3084.2000000000003s)]
*  Right? We've talked about this. We have $6 trillion we need to finance in the next nine months. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3089.88s)]
*  So the singular goal, in my opinion, of the White House has been move the tenure [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3095.8s)]
*  as aggressively and as quickly as possible. And look what they've done. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3102.28s)]
*  As of yesterday, it's unbelievable what's happened in the tenure. You know, you are kissing 4%. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3106.28s)]
*  And we talked about this, if it had gone in the other direction, guys, 30 or 40 basis points, [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3111.4s)]
*  and it touched 5%, you're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars of extra money that would [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3115.88s)]
*  not have been found that would have had to be printed, right? And now this is hundreds of [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3121.8s)]
*  billions of dollars that we will save. So if we cut rates, if the Fed cuts rates, that's all [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3127.64s)]
*  predicated on them. This doesn't matter anymore. No, this is this is the Fed doesn't control the [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3134.04s)]
*  back end of the curve on the Treasury, the Treasury markets, the government sells treasuries. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3139.6400000000003s)]
*  Governments will not auction 10 years and the auctions will clear at around 4%. It is an [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3144.04s)]
*  enormous like, as an American, what we should all be thinking is irrespective of what you think you [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3149.7200000000003s)]
*  know, or what you think you like about tariffs, we should all have a moment where we exhale, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3155.4s)]
*  because the long end of the curve is giving us a respite in a storm. And we should be incredibly [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3160.6000000000004s)]
*  thankful. Because what I'm referring to, Chumup, is you said yesterday, Jerome Powell, you're on [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3167.96s)]
*  the clock. So maybe you could explain what you meant by that. Okay, so this is that's a different [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3173.08s)]
*  part of the curve. I understand it's a different thing. But I'm just trying to put together because [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3178.12s)]
*  those are the two things we're saying this action took. Okay, so we'll have Okay, so let's play the [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3181.96s)]
*  ball where it lies. Okay. The Wall Street smart money thought this was a $250 billion event, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3187.56s)]
*  they were wrong. This is part of why the stock market has reacted so violently today. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3193.8s)]
*  This is a $750 billion to trillion dollar event. Okay, this is a big moment in the market. So what [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3198.44s)]
*  does it create? It creates the risk of a recession. How do you minimize that risk? That is all about [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3206.1200000000003s)]
*  how easy it is for the average person to be able to borrow money. Where is that dictated? That is [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3213.32s)]
*  more dictated by the Fed and how they price the front end of the curve. So what we need to have [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3219.72s)]
*  happen now is while Scott is out financing $6 trillion on the back end, we now need to get Jerome [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3225.3199999999997s)]
*  Powell to cut the front end. And if you do it aggressively enough, you can introduce liquidity [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3232.2s)]
*  in a moment where small and medium sized businesses can go and get financed to weather the storm. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3237.8799999999997s)]
*  Shamak, I want to add on to your point, just so you guys know, there's roughly [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3244.36s)]
*  12 to $16 trillion of private corporate debt in America. So this is debt held by small businesses, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3249.0s)]
*  medium businesses, partnerships that have on average call it a 15% operating margin. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3256.76s)]
*  So they're going to be under pressure if there is some recessionary risk to make sure they have [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3264.1200000000003s)]
*  access to capital. And if you remember the interview that Besant gave to us a couple weeks ago, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3269.0800000000004s)]
*  he was very clear that one of his mandates is to enable the re-leveraging of the financial system, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3273.88s)]
*  meaning he wants to give banks the ability to issue more debt, to introduce more capital and [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3281.0s)]
*  more liquidity into the markets by taking away some of the regulatory restrictions that have [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3286.28s)]
*  made it more difficult for the banks to issue credit to business owners and to individuals. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3292.28s)]
*  So if they are successful in their deregulatory efforts, it will introduce more liquidity into [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3297.48s)]
*  the market coupled with deregulatory work that they're making in the other parts of the [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3302.92s)]
*  administration as this is their declaration, not mine. Their intention is to make sure that that [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3307.96s)]
*  capital flows into building businesses, building new businesses, underwriting new jobs, creating [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3312.92s)]
*  more employment. That's the theory that they're trying to execute. Obviously, it's part of this [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3318.36s)]
*  three legged stool, but if it doesn't all work, the stool falls over. Okay, Shamak, give us an [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3322.44s)]
*  example here. And I'm trying to get you to paint the entire picture here because the tariff [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3327.7200000000003s)]
*  cudgel is not making sense to a lot of folks. Okay, so it's not all good news. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3332.68s)]
*  Yes. So let's paint the... So I'll give a very specific example. A friend of ours [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3335.7999999999997s)]
*  runs a 100 plus year company. I'm just going to say it in generic terms so that I don't [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3343.08s)]
*  betray his confidence. Sure, no problem. And this is a business that's been built over 100 years, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3348.6s)]
*  owned by an American family, an incredible family, and they make products that we all know and love. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3354.6s)]
*  And what did this action do? So in their example, they're in a very difficult position because [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3359.72s)]
*  they have, as David said, a very tight operating margin because they have to compete [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3366.2s)]
*  ferociously against China. And they've done everything possible to maintain their capabilities [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3371.64s)]
*  in America, hire American workers in the heartland, but still compete against China. It's tough. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3378.52s)]
*  And this action today swings them from profitability to a potential yearly loss [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3384.84s)]
*  in a meaningful order of magnitude, like hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3392.2000000000003s)]
*  So Jason, that's the other side of this tariff coin. So we have to find a way of finding those [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3396.28s)]
*  examples. And as Ben said, excluding them somehow or giving them reprieve, because that wasn't the [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3402.44s)]
*  intention, I think, of what Trump was trying to do yesterday. That's an example of a company that [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3408.44s)]
*  should be winning and should continue to win and fight the good fight against China and try to [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3412.92s)]
*  continue to employ thousands of Americans. But this thing, because they had some capacity in [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3418.52s)]
*  some other countries, not China, by the way, got it blows the thing up. And so now you have to fix [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3424.04s)]
*  those things. All right, Ben, let me get you involved here. I'm going to play you a quick [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3429.32s)]
*  clip from Rand Paul. And I want to get your feedback on executive power and then on tariffs [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3432.6800000000003s)]
*  themselves and if it's a good idea or a bad idea. Play the clip. What's the rationale for [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3440.84s)]
*  getting behind this? Well, one, we should not live under emergency rule. The Constitution said taxes [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3445.1600000000003s)]
*  are raised by Congress, most specifically taxes originate in the House and come to the Senate, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3450.76s)]
*  some against emergency rule. We are richer because of trade with Canada. And so is Canada. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3455.4s)]
*  Whenever you trade with somebody, when an individual buys somebody else's product, [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3461.6400000000003s)]
*  it's mutually beneficial or you wouldn't buy it. If the trade is voluntary, it's always beneficial. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3465.64s)]
*  There is no Canada versus the US. The consumer wins when the price is the lowest price. Tariffs [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3471.7999999999997s)]
*  raise prices and they're a bad idea for the economy. Ben, your thoughts on the two issues [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3477.7999999999997s)]
*  is trade good for consumers? This is what, you know, I think is on top of everybody's mind that [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3482.12s)]
*  yeah, the whole Trump presidency and he won in large part due to inflation and Biden economics [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3486.92s)]
*  and that he was going to reduce inflation. And I think a lot of people believe inflation's about [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3494.44s)]
*  to come roaring back. Your thoughts on the two issues? Well, I mean, obviously on a macroeconomic [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3499.8s)]
*  level, I totally agree with Senator Paul. When it comes to the powers of the presidency, I think [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3503.7200000000003s)]
*  that it's pretty extraordinary that we should be able to use the trade deficit as a national [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3507.08s)]
*  emergency sufficient to put down what effectively amounts to a $700 billion tax increase on the [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3512.76s)]
*  American people. If you're talking about them paying the price of the tariffs on the other end, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3519.48s)]
*  Congress, you know, I think that if things get bad enough, there are a bunch of, you know, streams [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3524.1200000000003s)]
*  obviously here that cross. One of the big things here is that Congress is up for re-elect in a year [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3528.52s)]
*  and a half. And if the Republicans lose Congress in a year and a half, then whatever tricks President [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3533.1600000000003s)]
*  Trump is trying to pull in terms of being able to rejigger the rate at which we are paying back our [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3537.7200000000003s)]
*  national debt, all that stuff goes by the wayside because if Democrats win Congress, pretty much [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3542.6000000000004s)]
*  everything comes to a crashing halt. And there are a lot of Republicans who are in swing districts or [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3546.44s)]
*  in say, R plus five, R plus 10 districts who are suddenly going to feel pretty vulnerable. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3550.84s)]
*  A recession takes everybody with it. It takes Secretary Besson, it takes the president, [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3556.36s)]
*  it takes J.D. Vance, it takes everybody with it. Recessions tend to crush the president who is in [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3560.28s)]
*  power at the time, regardless of what their long-term plan is. When they say short-term pain for [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3564.36s)]
*  long-term gain, again, I think that there are a few factors here that I would like to see played [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3569.1600000000003s)]
*  out. For example, if there is an inflationary effect to the tariffs in terms of price, does that [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3574.44s)]
*  mean that Jerome Powell is going to eject additional liquidity into the markets by [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3579.72s)]
*  decreasing interest rates? It's hard to see how. I mean, he's holding the interest rate steady [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3583.16s)]
*  right now without decreasing the interest rates despite President Trump basically [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3586.52s)]
*  blasting him publicly since before he was even the president formally, he's just the president's [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3590.4399999999996s)]
*  elect that time. So again, it's hard for me to see how all of this squares into what looks like a [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3596.2799999999997s)]
*  really well-calibrated policy. And then beyond that, in the long term, tricks that we play with [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3602.04s)]
*  regard to the rate of interest, paying back our national debt are not going to be sufficient to [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3608.92s)]
*  pay back our national debt unless we have robust economic growth. And so a lot has to be bet on the [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3612.6800000000003s)]
*  robust economic growth out earning essentially the levels of debt that we are currently racking up. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3617.32s)]
*  And while I love what Doge is doing, the systemic drivers of our national debt are not actually [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3623.08s)]
*  being touched at this point by Doge. I mean, it's the means tested welfare programs that are really [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3627.08s)]
*  the systemic long-term drivers of our national debt. And military, I think would be number two. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3631.0s)]
*  Military is a percentage of the GDP or is a percentage of the budget has been relatively [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3635.96s)]
*  stable and in some cases decreasing since the end of the Iraq War. But when it comes to the [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3640.92s)]
*  means tested welfare programs, those continue to grow as a percentage of the budget and over time [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3646.6s)]
*  are increasingly unfunded. Yeah, as our population ages and the population grows. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3650.84s)]
*  Freeburg putting aside executive power in the midterms, which yeah, that would change everything. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3656.36s)]
*  What are your thoughts on just inflation and tariffs and the chance that this comes back [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3663.32s)]
*  and explodes in the administration's lap? Well, I think there are three consequences, [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3668.6s)]
*  not necessarily related to inflation that are just worth spending time on. One of which I don't think [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3673.56s)]
*  gets talked about enough. The first is just the challenge of tariffs in general. And I shared this [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3678.44s)]
*  clip with you guys over the group chat yesterday from Ronald Reagan talking. Oh, it's so funny. I [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3685.08s)]
*  haven't chewed up. I actually edit it. Let's do that. Let's play this clip and get your reaction. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3689.16s)]
*  And today many economic analysts and historians argue that high tariff legislation passed back [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3692.92s)]
*  in that period called the Smoot Hawley tariff greatly deepened the depression and prevented [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3698.92s)]
*  economic recovery. You see, at first, when someone says, let's impose tariffs on foreign imports, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3704.52s)]
*  it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3710.2s)]
*  And sometimes for a short while it works, but only for a short time. What eventually occurs is [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3715.48s)]
*  first homegrown industries start relying on government protection in the form of high tariffs. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3721.96s)]
*  They stop competing and stop making the innovative management and technological changes they need [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3727.2400000000002s)]
*  to succeed in world markets. And then while all this is going on, something even worse occurs. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3733.1600000000003s)]
*  People stop buying. Then the worst happens. Markets shrink and collapse. Businesses and [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3739.0s)]
*  industries shut down and millions of people lose their jobs. The memory of all this occurring back [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3744.28s)]
*  in the thirties made me determined when I came to Washington to spare the American people, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3750.28s)]
*  the protectionist legislation that destroys prosperity. So let me just say three things [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3754.92s)]
*  that I think are going to be important consequences, one of which doesn't get talked about much at all. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3759.6400000000003s)]
*  The first is the important point about the decline in competitiveness that arises when you use [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3764.2000000000003s)]
*  protectionist tactics like import tariffs. So ultimately in order to be competitive in the [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3768.92s)]
*  market, you need to have a free market to test how good you are relative to your competitors. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3774.76s)]
*  And if you use tariffs or other taxes or other government intervening systems to distort the [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3780.04s)]
*  natural forces of markets, meaning there's a buyer and a seller, there may be multiple sellers, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3786.44s)]
*  and ultimately the buyer will choose the best seller. Then you're creating a disincentive [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3791.2400000000002s)]
*  for American enterprise to be more competitive. We lost manufacturing because we weren't competitive [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3797.72s)]
*  in manufacturing. Putting a tariff on other manufacturing countries does not make Americans [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3802.68s)]
*  more competitive. It basically gives American businesses a crutch. Give an example, David. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3808.2799999999997s)]
*  So let's talk about manufacturing. So if I'm using a traditional assembly line with low efficiency [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3813.7999999999997s)]
*  systems, I'm going to be more expensive to make a device than a Chinese factory that's built with [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3818.36s)]
*  a lot of automation, high efficiency systems, et cetera. And so if I'm saying, well, to buy the [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3823.64s)]
*  Chinese product, you've got to pay twice as much because there's a tariff now. The American [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3828.7599999999998s)]
*  company does not have an incentive to invest in automating or building better technology or [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3832.7599999999998s)]
*  adopting new technology to make themselves competitive in the marketplace. So that's the [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3838.12s)]
*  challenge with tariffs long-term is that they distort economic consequences that arise in a [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3842.7599999999998s)]
*  traditional free market system. The second consequence I think is important is under this [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3847.8799999999997s)]
*  guise and in the near term, the effect of some of these tariffs is going to be the loss of revenue [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3852.84s)]
*  for a significant chunk of the American businesses. In particular, I'll use one example. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3857.4s)]
*  People may not remember this because it wasn't that big of a thing, but between 2016 and 2020, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3863.56s)]
*  during the last Trump administration, there was a continued kind of tariff and trade escalation [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3867.8s)]
*  between Trump and China. And during that time, China stopped buying American ag exports and [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3872.52s)]
*  China is the biggest buyer of American agricultural products. As a result, the Trump [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3878.36s)]
*  administration had to issue two support payment checks to farmers that totaled $28 billion in 2018 [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3882.44s)]
*  and 2019. Just because of that China stepping out of the buying market, American farmers represent [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3891.32s)]
*  a large amount of the voting block for the Republican party. And so I think that the second [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3897.56s)]
*  consequence is going to be that there is going to need to be financial support, which means increased [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3903.0s)]
*  government spending if we intend to keep the tariffs in place and the global market stops [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3907.64s)]
*  buying American exports. That's the second consequence. The third consequence, which is [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3912.52s)]
*  the one I am most worried about, which I think about a lot, is China had the state council meeting [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3916.3599999999997s)]
*  a couple of days ago. And in that state council meeting, they announced a series of measures and [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3924.2799999999997s)]
*  a series of steps that they would be willing to take on IP infringement in the case of retaliatory [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3928.52s)]
*  tariff escalation in a trade war. What that means is that China may step up and say, you know what, [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3936.6s)]
*  we are disregarding all of the IP rights held by IP rights holders around the world, and they could [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3942.12s)]
*  steal IP more openly, more brazenly. And because they have a lower cost of manufacturing, they have [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3947.88s)]
*  a larger manufacturing base, a lower cost of power, they could basically take the only thing [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3953.4s)]
*  that much of American enterprise relies on, which is our IP rights, and say, we're just going to, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3958.2799999999997s)]
*  well, people might say, oh, they already do that. They already do that. They do it to an extent. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3962.84s)]
*  But imagine if China just made copies of Microsoft Word and started selling it around the world for [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3966.92s)]
*  $5. Yeah, I mean, they did that internally for some period of time. Then they started to respect it [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3971.88s)]
*  internally, but they've never done a great point by shipping Disney films overseas. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3977.1600000000003s)]
*  That's right. And so now imagine if they started taking all of American manufacturing drawings, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3981.32s)]
*  blueprints, designs, and they have all this manufacturing capacity and they sold everything [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3985.6400000000003s)]
*  at 10 cents on the dollar to all of the global markets that the US is now cutting trade ties [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3989.4s)]
*  with because of the tariff escalation. And China says, we don't care about your IP rights anymore. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3993.96s)]
*  We don't care because you've cut us off. The rest of the world needs someone that will sell to them. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=3998.6800000000003s)]
*  I will also say China, one thing that's not talked about, which I'll add in, [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4002.6s)]
*  seems to have developed three nanometer semiconductor manufacturing technology, [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4006.12s)]
*  which is going to go into production in Q3 of 2025, and will end up being in full production [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4010.76s)]
*  in 2026. This will move the base from Taiwan potentially into China. They are developing [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4015.48s)]
*  lithography systems. They're developing advanced semiconductor manufacturing systems, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4021.32s)]
*  and they will effectively have everything from energy to the minerals, to the manufacturing [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4024.92s)]
*  capacity, to support and service all and the software now all of technology. And so we are [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4029.96s)]
*  in a really disadvantaged position if China does choose in this moment to disregard the IP rights [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4035.08s)]
*  of American businesses. So that's a big- They have the ability to swing back at us, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4039.88s)]
*  Chamath, do you want to wrap us up here? I'll take the other side of all of this. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4044.6s)]
*  I'll start with, again, there's no point prognosticating when they're just telling you [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4051.0s)]
*  what they intend to do. Nick, you want to play the clip? [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4057.24s)]
*  I could see in the next few years that we are going to have to have some kind of a grand global [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4060.12s)]
*  economic reordering. There's something on the equivalent of a new Bretton Woods, or if you want [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4067.72s)]
*  to go back, like a treat- something back to the steel agreements or the treaty of Versailles. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4073.08s)]
*  I mean, what is that just to kind of like refresher? What are we talking about? We're talking [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4079.64s)]
*  about commercial relations between, at the time, 44 countries, right? This is a big statement. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4083.48s)]
*  I don't think that these kinds of things are said casually at a Manhattan Institute cocktail hour. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4089.88s)]
*  And I think that people understand if you're kind of like steeped in the history of it, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4097.88s)]
*  how important these kinds of statements are. So I think I take this similarly to how I take [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4102.2s)]
*  Trump's rhetoric on tariffs. And I'm spending some time trying to now understand [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4108.679999999999s)]
*  how are the scenarios that could play out? Because I think David is right if you assume [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4115.0s)]
*  the status quo, meaning what are the risks? But what they're saying is, we're going to question [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4120.5199999999995s)]
*  this. We're actually going to go here and just totally rewrite that. If that happens as part of [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4125.88s)]
*  this, all bets are off, in my opinion. I don't think any of us know with any certainty what a new [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4131.4s)]
*  economic framework would look like. And if Scott is basically prepping himself to say, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4138.28s)]
*  hey, put me in, coach, I'm ready. I would take that seriously. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4144.44s)]
*  Ben, what should be- let's talk about on-shoring and bringing these jobs, bringing these factories [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4149.879999999999s)]
*  back to America. It seems to me a bit crazy that we're going to make fast fashion and people's [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4157.24s)]
*  Coachella wear and their anchor, you know, USB-C cables here. Pharmaceuticals, sure, we need that [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4164.36s)]
*  for strategic purposes. We obviously need the military and chips. But outside of that, is there [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4170.76s)]
*  some rationale here when we have the lowest unemployment of our lifetime, and everybody wants [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4176.2s)]
*  to come here, you know, to immigrate to this country, to doing these tariffs and trying to [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4181.48s)]
*  create jobs here that we don't necessarily need? We have too much employment right now [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4186.839999999999s)]
*  in the market and not enough bodies to fill all the open job wrecks. What do you think? [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4192.919999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think one of the things that's really fascinating is the kind of difference in messaging [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4197.4s)]
*  that you hear between the Treasury Secretary, Howard Lutnick, and the Commerce Secretary, [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4201.4s)]
*  and the President. I mean, they're all messaging kind of different things. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4205.24s)]
*  I think Secretary Besant is making the strongest case for what's being done with this sort of [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4208.12s)]
*  long-term, what does reordering look like? And even there, I'm still lacking clarity on what a [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4212.36s)]
*  reordered world trade relationship actually, what is the end of the rainbow there? What does that [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4217.4s)]
*  actually look like when all is said and done so that I can kind of grasp exactly what he wants [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4221.64s)]
*  that to look like? I think that, you know, Secretary Lutnick seems to actually just like tariffs, [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4226.12s)]
*  and President Trump seems to have a picture in his head when it comes to factories that we're [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4231.0s)]
*  going to revitalize the steel mills, that we're going to be doing the kinds of jobs that we did [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4235.08s)]
*  back in the 1950s, the sort of nostalgia that President Trump has in sort of his own mind about [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4240.04s)]
*  these sorts of jobs that, by the way, nobody in modern life actually wants to work at. If you were [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4245.96s)]
*  to work at a Ford factory in 1953 in a non-air-conditioned factory riveting for a living, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4250.6s)]
*  you would actually be quite unhappy, and you should be very happy that actually there are [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4254.84s)]
*  machines that do that now. And you hear this kind of talk, sometimes bandied about, not just with [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4257.8s)]
*  regard to offshoring, but with regards to technology and machines. I mean, I've talked to, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4262.2s)]
*  I remember a few years back in 2018, I talked to Tucker Carlson on my program, and he literally [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4267.0s)]
*  said that he would outlaw self-driving cars because it would get rid of white trucker jobs, [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4270.599999999999s)]
*  you know, blue-collar trucker jobs in Ohio and Michigan. And when I said, well, that sounds [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4275.72s)]
*  kind of luddite, he said, well, the luddites had a point, and then suggested that on the basis of [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4280.36s)]
*  safety, he would ban it. And I remember asking him, but those self-driving cars will presumably [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4285.4s)]
*  be more safe than humans driving. A magnitude safer, yeah. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4290.36s)]
*  Yes, and what he actually said was, well, you know, you asked me on what grounds I would ban it, [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4293.08s)]
*  not whether that was true or not. But, you know, I think that that is, I think this is the danger [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4297.799999999999s)]
*  that particularly tech runs when we're talking about these sorts of things, is to believe that [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4303.24s)]
*  the animus for trade relationships around the world or the anti-competitive nature of many of [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4307.719999999999s)]
*  the activities that are being taken are relegated solely to sort of the foreign sphere. I think [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4315.16s)]
*  that you could easily see that turn on, quote unquote, job loss that is caused by AI, or job [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4319.8s)]
*  loss that is caused by technological gain. And the truth is that if you're talking about job [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4325.16s)]
*  loss in the manufacturing sector in the United States, the vast majority of job loss in the [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4328.84s)]
*  manufacturing sector is not due to offshoring, it's due to technological advancements. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4331.96s)]
*  Manufacturing productivity in the United States has actually dramatically risen since the 1980s. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4335.56s)]
*  Okay, so let's play conspiracy theorists for a second, because, okay, you're right, Ben, like, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4340.360000000001s)]
*  you want that clarity, I want that clarity, Freeberg wants it, J. Cal, everybody wants it. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4343.8s)]
*  But at this moment, if it's a catalyst, to your point, where everybody is forced into the room, [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4348.68s)]
*  and Trump leads a grand bargain across the 50 or 60 most important trading partners in the world, [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4354.04s)]
*  what does that look like? Like, it's almost like, okay, we're re-establishing something [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4362.12s)]
*  that's akin to the United Nations and what the United Nations was meant to be post World War II. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4368.360000000001s)]
*  But that institution has totally failed. So this new thing exists purely on economic lines [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4373.72s)]
*  and cooperation. I don't know, I struggle, actually, to your point, to kind of imagine, [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4379.5599999999995s)]
*  what are the outcomes? But there's so many unbelievable outcomes in that scenario, [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4384.92s)]
*  if they were able to get the top 50 commercial mercantile countries together in a room and say, [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4389.4s)]
*  let's hammer something up. I mean, I totally agree with that. I think one of my questions, [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4394.04s)]
*  however, is the if you take a look at some of the examples that Scott is using there, when he talks [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4397.08s)]
*  about the Bretton Woods Agreement, or if you're going to talk about what Nixon did in debasing [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4402.52s)]
*  the dollar, Versailles. Versailles, at least, would be a better example in the sense that you [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4406.6s)]
*  didn't have a global hegemony at the time. If you're talking about the Bretton Woods system, [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4410.68s)]
*  literally the rest of the world effectively did not exist in the post World War II era. So what is [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4414.76s)]
*  everybody going to bet on? They have to bet on the American dollar. There's no other choice. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4418.52s)]
*  By the time that Nixon decides to go off the gold standard, essentially, he has to rely on the [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4421.4800000000005s)]
*  organization of the petrodollar in order to make sure that people don't dissociate from the United [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4425.64s)]
*  States. What is the thing that's going to draw people to the United States as opposed to looking [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4429.88s)]
*  to a rising competitor like a China? That's a great question. So what is that thing? What [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4434.4400000000005s)]
*  do you think that's a great question? AI comes to mind. Yeah. I mean, [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4438.76s)]
*  AI is the only possibility, which is why I think the AI regime inside the Trump administration is [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4442.28s)]
*  so deeply important. I also think this is why I'm warning about the possibility that these sort of [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4446.2s)]
*  anti-free market forces that are related to tariffs aren't just related to tariffs in some quarters. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4450.92s)]
*  This is where populism can kind of run out of control and start to actually turn against some [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4455.32s)]
*  of its tech masters in some of these cases. And so one of the things that I'm very concerned about [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4459.56s)]
*  is if I was talking with Danielle Smith, who's the premier of Alberta the other day, and she was [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4464.120000000001s)]
*  talking about the fact that Canada, like she's very conservative. Alberta tends to be a more [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4468.360000000001s)]
*  conservative area of Canada. And she was talking about how if Mark Carney were to become prime [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4472.04s)]
*  minister of Canada instead of Pierre Poliev, that he actually is eager for the tariff war because [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4477.240000000001s)]
*  it allows him to reorient toward China and away from the United States. And there are countries [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4481.64s)]
*  that absolutely would love to do that. I mean, there's a case to be made that the EU would love [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4486.2s)]
*  an easy off ramp with Russia and China and use this as an excuse as a way of reorienting [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4490.28s)]
*  back toward Russian oil, for example, and then Chinese markets because that Chinese market is [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4495.639999999999s)]
*  enormous. These would be lower inputs, right? I mean, you have lower input costs, which means [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4499.639999999999s)]
*  life better for citizens. And citizens like cheap things. They like cheap oil in their cars and [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4503.08s)]
*  they like cheap cars. They'll be bringing BYD cars into Europe. Exactly. And the thing that [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4509.16s)]
*  I'm worried about is when I look at the forget about Europe and forget about Canada for a second, [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4513.64s)]
*  the tariffs that kind of shocked me when I looked at that list were all the tariffs on the Southeast [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4517.64s)]
*  Asian countries, right? All of those countries where production has been shifting out of China [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4521.96s)]
*  to places like, for example, Vietnam or Cambodia. The production has been shifting to those places [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4526.52s)]
*  specifically because companies know that the United States is going after China. Well, now, [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4531.240000000001s)]
*  why exactly would you manufacture in Vietnam when Vietnam is going to be with a 46% tariff rate on [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4537.400000000001s)]
*  the basis that we have a 90? It's more than that, Ben. It's like they've made those investments [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4542.2s)]
*  over the last five or six years. And so you have tens and hundreds of millions of dollars, [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4547.639999999999s)]
*  billions of dollars of sunk costs. Now, what do you do in that moment? [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4552.679999999999s)]
*  These were specifically designed, Ben, to be a diversification strategy. Japan was paying [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4555.8s)]
*  their companies to build factories outside of China and Apple was doing India, Vietnam, [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4561.16s)]
*  to build AirPods and laptops and even the iPhone being made outside of China. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4566.36s)]
*  That diversification strategy is wiped out. Jake, did you watch the presser yesterday? The [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4571.88s)]
*  worst part for me, I only had one moment where I was like, oh gosh, he stopped on Sri Lanka and he [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4577.5599999999995s)]
*  goes, Sri Lanka. Good old Sri Lanka. Okay, Chamath, amazing Sri Lankan, but Sri Lanka, very tough on [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4583.5599999999995s)]
*  us. Not very accepting. Go ahead, Ben, you can do yours. You can do your dueling about Sri Lanka. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4592.76s)]
*  Just do a great Trump. Okay. And that's the reason why Ben Shapiro's podcast number two to all in [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4598.2s)]
*  now because of the Ben Shapiro Trump impersonation. Ben Shapiro, a great American, have you been to the [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4604.92s)]
*  White House? I have actually. Yeah. Have you been invited in this? Or are you still anti-Trump or [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4611.24s)]
*  never Trumper? He was a nasty never Trumper. Now he's pro Trump. Exactly. I had the same exact [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4618.84s)]
*  trajectory as JD Vance, except I didn't end up vice president of the United States. But I think [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4627.08s)]
*  that, again, when we talk about the rollout, the fact that, for example, the meme online right now, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4631.8s)]
*  and I know we all kind of live in a meme world, that the meme is the president and JD Vance [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4637.64s)]
*  lecturing a penguin because on that chart is the herd islands. Have you even apologized for eating [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4640.76s)]
*  all that mackerel? No, no, wait, what are you guys talking about? There's an island that got a 10% [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4646.52s)]
*  tariff, but there's nothing on the island except penguins. Yeah. It's a nation state. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4653.8s)]
*  This is where I started. Come on, have you even apologized? Okay. You got no cards. There are no [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4658.4400000000005s)]
*  cards. This penguin has no cards. You have no cards to play. Okay. Stop. Stop. You've got a great [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4666.76s)]
*  tuxedo. At least you showed up in a tux. Okay? Good stuff. Oh my God. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4673.56s)]
*  By the way, I think that Ben's framing of this, thank you for that, because that was really helpful [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4681.4800000000005s)]
*  to me. You're right. If we try to reconvene a new Bretton Woods, we have to have an anchor asset. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4685.56s)]
*  So it's a really great question. What is that anchor asset? It has to be AI. But then, [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4694.68s)]
*  underneath that AI thing, we have these two very complicated problems. One is a meaningful [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4699.8s)]
*  energy problem. I've been talking about this now incessantly. We don't have enough electrons. We [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4703.8s)]
*  just don't. And then the second is what Friedberg mentioned before, which is that we have a very [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4709.32s)]
*  delicate technological supply chain to make the underlying silicon we need for these things. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4714.36s)]
*  Neither are trivial. These are not things that can be easily solved. Yeah. The AI supply chain is [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4720.12s)]
*  electricity. We're going from one terawatt to two. China's going from three to eight [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4726.28s)]
*  over the same time period, just to be clear. So they're accelerating. The second is rare earth [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4731.24s)]
*  materials that we don't mine for. We've outsourced mining. And Doug Burgum told me an interesting [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4737.0s)]
*  stat. He's our secretary of the interior. He said, we only graduate 200 people a year in the United [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4743.08s)]
*  States with degrees in mining. Oh, gosh. Because beginning in the 90s, when globalization took off, [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4748.759999999999s)]
*  we basically stopped mining in this country and moved everything to all the places. Because we [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4753.32s)]
*  had this NIMBYism, we didn't want to have mining in our backyard. The third, obviously, is the [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4757.0s)]
*  manufacturing of semiconductors, which we don't do. The components to do the manufacturing. So [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4762.28s)]
*  there's a company called ASML, which everyone that works in tech knows about. They have these [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4767.4s)]
*  advanced lithography systems to make the semiconductors. They don't sell to China. So now [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4771.799999999999s)]
*  China's got their own homegrown lithography systems. And we don't make any of that in-house. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4777.08s)]
*  We don't mine. We don't have enough power. We don't have the materials. And we don't make [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4783.16s)]
*  lithography. And we don't have any fabs. I said this before, but one of the biggest [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4787.0s)]
*  national security threats that we created out of nowhere was when the Wall Street Journal was [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4790.52s)]
*  allowed to do a detailed article on ASML. And one of the craziest and scariest stats is that [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4795.64s)]
*  there is a person, literally one person, that can operate these machines that are trained by ASML [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4804.04s)]
*  and then forward deployed. And there was a woman that was profiled. And I thought, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4809.64s)]
*  this is a national security risk. You should not be outing who this woman is. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4814.04s)]
*  She's going to be kidnapped. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4818.6s)]
*  Brianna Hall. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4820.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4820.6s)]
*  Go. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4821.400000000001s)]
*  At the end of the day, what the US has is the weights. We've got 70 billion parameters, [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4821.88s)]
*  and we call that an AI model. That 70 billion parameters, if someone gets a copy of it, [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4827.08s)]
*  they've got an AI model. So how much of an advantage do we really have? [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4831.88s)]
*  And the other thing that we had was- [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4835.320000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, China's got the whole supply chain, and now they're making their own models. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4836.44s)]
*  And the thing that we had was our trade relationships with all the places that had [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4840.44s)]
*  all of these things that we actually needed. Right? This is one of the reasons- [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4844.28s)]
*  And it was super high functioning. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4846.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes, it was quite high functioning. And then beyond that, you also have the problem of [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4847.879999999999s)]
*  what happens if there's just less demand for dollars on the world stage? I mean, [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4852.839999999999s)]
*  the exit of the dollar as the world's global reserve currency is going to have some pretty [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4856.5199999999995s)]
*  nasty spillover effects. And it's going to require the government to start sucking in [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4860.679999999999s)]
*  more dollars from the American population in order to pay off all of these debts that [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4864.92s)]
*  we're racking up. So I mean, all these things tend- Like you could see a world where we magic [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4868.76s)]
*  our way out of this, but- That's good. This is what I've been saying to J. Cal, [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4872.76s)]
*  de-dollarization is what ends up happening. I mean, I think that's right. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4875.08s)]
*  Well, and this is what the stablecoins, I think, is set up to counter. People are now [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4877.4800000000005s)]
*  saying, hey, we're going to have- There's two stablecoin acts that are going around here. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4882.52s)]
*  One of them doesn't require, like, know your customer anti-money laundering terrorism stuff, [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4885.88s)]
*  which is tethers, according to many reports, bread and butter. And then the other one is to [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4891.24s)]
*  domesticate all this business, give it to Circle, give it to Stripe, give it to American companies, [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4898.12s)]
*  and force them to buy a certain percentage of treasuries and allow them to give interest, [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4904.599999999999s)]
*  which the stablecoin bills are now debating if they should give that. So I don't know if you guys [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4909.96s)]
*  are watching that, but that would be the greatest way to keep a buyer for our currency. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4914.76s)]
*  There's an analog to this that I think is important. Like, when you look at the debt to GDP [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4920.6s)]
*  of Japan, one of the critical questions is how can you have a functioning economy at 250%, [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4924.68s)]
*  260% debt to GDP? Right? And we're at sort of like hundred and teens, right? 120-something, [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4932.04s)]
*  whatever. And one of the critical advantages that they have is that they export a lot of incredible [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4937.88s)]
*  goods abroad, but they have an incredibly deep domestic pool of buyers for their own Japanese [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4944.6s)]
*  bonds. And so there's this permanent bid that exists because the net buyer can be a Japanese [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4950.4400000000005s)]
*  person on the margins, and they're always there. And it's not necessarily a person, it's an [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4957.160000000001s)]
*  insurance company, it's a pension fund, etc. The thing that US dollar stablecoins does is it starts [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4961.72s)]
*  to replicate one of those advantages, which again, if you think about having a release [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4968.92s)]
*  fell for the US economy, and if we needed to, all of a sudden scream to 200% debt to GDP. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4974.2s)]
*  The real question is where's the incremental net buyer of the US bond? And it could be the person [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4980.68s)]
*  that has to back the stablecoin, which would then say the people in charge of the crypto strategy, [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4987.8s)]
*  we won't name names. No, nobody knows anybody. That legislation needs to be incredibly permissive. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4992.92s)]
*  Because to your guys's point, we would want the bid to US treasuries to exist, and to be as [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=4998.92s)]
*  ferocious as possible. Right? Yeah, but I don't think you should give let Tether do it until they [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5004.76s)]
*  do an attestate until they do a proper audit, and they stop doing money laundering and terrorism [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5008.68s)]
*  and all the crazy stuff. I'm not going all the way there. But what Circle does is I think quite [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5013.4800000000005s)]
*  structured and, you know, circles. That's I mean, I think that circles. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5017.4s)]
*  USDC that's their pitch. And I think the Trump family now just launched their own stablecoin [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5023.16s)]
*  this week. So you're going to see 10 stablecoins. That is a great way to, you know, create [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5028.04s)]
*  competition. And I think it's really it's it's it's the right question that this administration [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5032.12s)]
*  has a responsibility to articulate. What is it that makes America the linchpin of the global economy [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5038.84s)]
*  of the Western democracy of the world is we enter this new era with this rising power in China. And [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5049.16s)]
*  I'm not sure that there's clarity today. What do you think it is? Oh, I'll tell you. Do you think [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5056.44s)]
*  it's both of you guys? What do you guys? Yeah, I mean, it's pretty clear what it is. The reason [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5061.96s)]
*  we keep winning and the reason China keeps stumbling is because we have rabid entrepreneurship and an [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5065.879999999999s)]
*  investment and crazy investment infrastructure. The fact that we will bet on entrepreneurs and [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5070.759999999999s)]
*  allow them to become billionaires or allow them to flame out and start again tomorrow, that [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5076.04s)]
*  entrepreneurial spirit of America is what needs to be preserved. That's what created SpaceX. That's [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5080.5199999999995s)]
*  what created Circle. We just talked about stripe, we need the American exceptionalism, and it has to [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5085.96s)]
*  be backed by recruiting, aka immigration of brilliant people like Sachs, like Freiburg, [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5091.24s)]
*  like Chamath, who were not born in this country. You can't do it just based on Ben Shapiro and [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5098.68s)]
*  J Cal. You need to be looking around the world for the smartest people and then plugging them [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5102.76s)]
*  into the entrepreneurial system here. That's the magic. And that's the golden news of America. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5107.24s)]
*  David, what do you think? That's a very good I mean, I think that's credible. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5112.6s)]
*  I honestly don't know if I can be dismissive of China, like J Cal says, they keep stumbling and [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5115.639999999999s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. I think that's absolutely wrong. There's a very good interview. What are those guys [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5121.08s)]
*  names from the Brookings Institution that do that podcast? Then you might know these guys, the three [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5126.68s)]
*  guys might as touch. Is that who you're talking about? Or is that a different podcast? I'm not [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5131.32s)]
*  sure. It's not in the top 100. I don't know. Yeah, it's not in the top. They talked about China, [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5135.88s)]
*  and they talked about actually the rise in China where they 30 x GDP per capita and call it 30 [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5141.56s)]
*  years because they allowed entrepreneurs. Are you talking about good fellows? Good fellows. Sounds [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5146.6s)]
*  right. Yeah. Yeah. That's the Stanford one. That's right. The Stanford fellows. Good fellows. Yeah, [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5151.56s)]
*  I think that was it. Pretty good product. A good talk on a good talk. No, no, no. It's Waldorf and [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5156.360000000001s)]
*  Statler. I think that's their names. Waldorf and Statler. Those are good fellows. That's what it [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5160.68s)]
*  is. Yeah. Nick, find a picture of Waldorf and Statler for free. They're so great. They're so [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5167.08s)]
*  good. So anyway, they made the point that because China allowed the entrepreneurism of the [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5173.24s)]
*  individuals to let the market run free and they have this throttle when they let the people run [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5181.24s)]
*  free, they let entrepreneurs and thrive. And then sometimes they pull the throttle back, J Cal. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5186.04s)]
*  They just did that and they crashed the whole thing. Now they've pushed it forward again. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5191.08s)]
*  And that's what drives the growth and the improvement in productivity and this [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5195.24s)]
*  extraordinary abundance in energy, in mining, and now in manufacturing. And it's, I think, [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5198.679999999999s)]
*  going to lead to a great era of prosperity for China. It's pretty clear with or without [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5204.76s)]
*  the conflict with the US. They've dramatically improved the conditions in that country over [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5208.84s)]
*  the last 30 years in a really profound historic way. So I don't want, I'm not going to be dismissive [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5213.8s)]
*  and say that they're stumbling. Let's give it to Ben and then I'll tell you what I'm dismissing. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5218.36s)]
*  So first of all, I think that China does face some serious, real serious structural problems [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5221.639999999999s)]
*  ranging from demographics to debt. And I also think that if you take a look at the history of [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5225.88s)]
*  economic fascism, which is what they're attempting to do, which is using capitalist methodologies in [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5232.36s)]
*  order to prop up a very tyrannical government that will step in. In a centrally planned way. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5237.4s)]
*  Exactly. And so for a short period of time, that seems like that will work. And then the problem is [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5242.5199999999995s)]
*  you can find yourself in a blind alley fairly quickly. And right now, AI is not a blind alley, [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5247.96s)]
*  but we also don't know exactly which way AI is going to develop in the most profitable way. I [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5252.12s)]
*  mean, the amount of money that's been poured into AI has not yet been justified by the amount of [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5255.32s)]
*  net on the return on the actual investment, obviously. And so if you don't, this is the [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5260.92s)]
*  benefit of the American market is that you have everybody chasing everything all the time. And one [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5266.2s)]
*  of those things is going to hit. The benefit of the Chinese market is you have everyone chasing [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5270.04s)]
*  one thing all the time. If that's the thing that actually hits, they'll do amazing, but it's possible [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5274.2s)]
*  that they completely miss it. But the problem is, I think, and this is where you get back to the [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5278.04s)]
*  political in the United States and the necessity of avoiding a recession is that to me, the scariest [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5281.48s)]
*  thing that is happening inside the Trump administration is not something that's bad. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5287.5599999999995s)]
*  When President Trump was inaugurated, there was one picture that spoke of the, that kind of summed [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5291.5599999999995s)]
*  up the inauguration. It was President Trump there with Tim Cook and with the, and with, and with [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5295.72s)]
*  with Elon and with all the billionaires behind him, all the tech bros right behind him. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5301.4800000000005s)]
*  If there is a recession, what comes next is not going to be salutary to innovation, [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5305.160000000001s)]
*  to investment, to technology, to anything remotely like that. And so the idea of short-term [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5309.8s)]
*  pain, it better be really, really short-term. The American people do not have patience for this. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5314.360000000001s)]
*  And if the, and if it goes sideways, then what you're going to get is a populist revolt on the [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5318.6s)]
*  left and a populist revolt on the right that is going to take down everybody who is even remotely [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5322.84s)]
*  connected with this idea of free market capitalism. And so I think that one of the dangers in, in [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5328.2s)]
*  sort of attempting to manipulate the economy this way is that we're saying, okay, we're going to, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5333.639999999999s)]
*  we're going to try these kind of methodologies of government control in which we rejigger the world [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5337.16s)]
*  economy in this way and that way, and then we'll magic our way out of it with, with stable coin [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5341.5599999999995s)]
*  and AI. Maybe, or maybe the best way to do this would actually be to allow the thing to thrive [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5345.48s)]
*  that has always thrived in America, which is lower the regulations, let people innovate, let people [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5350.28s)]
*  fail, let people succeed, get the hell out of the way. And yes, actually do the things that you need [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5354.36s)]
*  to do in cutting government debt by doing the hard things. And, and the only way you're going to be [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5358.5199999999995s)]
*  able to do all those things is through continued success, not pain to get to some long-term gain. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5364.12s)]
*  It's got to be entrepreneurship. And there are some sub-factors of it. In order to have a vibrant [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5368.28s)]
*  entrepreneurial community, you need to have immigration. That's why I asked Trump on this [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5372.92s)]
*  thing, on this program, can we get green cards? Can we get people who have degrees here, especially [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5377.4s)]
*  coming out of Stanford to stay in the country? He said, yes, he'd staple them on the degrees. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5382.6s)]
*  Great. The next thing is getting Lena con out and ending the wrath of Lena con. We need M&A [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5386.04s)]
*  because when you have M&A, the companies get bigger. The fact that YouTube and Android and [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5392.280000000001s)]
*  AdSense were purchased by Google made it into massive success. It is on a global basis today. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5398.68s)]
*  And the fact that Metta was able to buy things, you may not like it when these companies get too [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5404.84s)]
*  powerful. But what happened to Jack Ma is the reason, Freebird, that I don't believe a dictator [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5408.44s)]
*  will ever compete with our country if we stay entrepreneurial and not socialist. Socialism [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5415.24s)]
*  is a cul-de-sac, as you're saying, Ben, and it might work for a short period of time. But then [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5421.48s)]
*  someone like Xi Jinping is going to do what dictators do, which is implode. He saw Jack [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5426.28s)]
*  Ma get popular. He sent them to get re-educated and do some painting. And he took up oil painting. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5430.599999999999s)]
*  He got rid of every educational company and pulled up the chart of Chinese investment, Nick, [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5436.52s)]
*  if you have it. Boom, it just got smashed. And this is what dictators do. They do what Putin did. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5440.92s)]
*  He invades Ukraine. His economy goes off the rails. And this is what Xi Jinping did. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5447.080000000001s)]
*  They always implode. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5452.360000000001s)]
*  Let me give you a step ladder to get off your soap box so I can ask Ben a question. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5453.4800000000005s)]
*  Ben, when you said that in a recession, definitely not. That's exactly right. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5457.4800000000005s)]
*  How come you guys have to give me a hard time? When you go on your passionate rant, [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5463.16s)]
*  I give you kudos. What do you do? You just shake it in some stupid statement. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5470.2s)]
*  It says the word dictator. It's like, oh, the dictator. Ben agrees with me. Ben agrees. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5475.08s)]
*  American exceptionalism emanate. Ben and I, that's it. I'm leaving the program. Ben and I are doing [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5478.679999999999s)]
*  all in 2.0. Let me rant against dictators for a minute. Go ahead, Ben. No. You should just go [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5483.88s)]
*  rant about the Trump administration and get your cabinet position. Go ahead. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5489.88s)]
*  Okay. Ben, when you talk about in a recession, they go after tech companies. Can you just explain [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5493.16s)]
*  that more? Just explain that. I'm not sure I understood that totally. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5499.24s)]
*  Okay. So there's a recession. And President Trump, the way that people tend to think of politics [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5501.64s)]
*  is not on a granular level. They tend to see it on sort of a pixelated level because most [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5506.84s)]
*  people don't engage with politics on a granular level. They see a Surat painting. They don't see [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5510.52s)]
*  all the dots. They just see Sunday in the Park with George. And so when it comes to a recession, [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5514.52s)]
*  the image that's going to come to mind for the Trump administration is that this is an [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5519.4s)]
*  administration that is extremely friendly to business, particularly when it comes to tech. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5522.28s)]
*  And so whoever is standing next to President Trump, if there is a serious recession, [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5526.44s)]
*  gets nuked, gets caught in the fallout. And if that happens, then you will see a resurgent left [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5530.839999999999s)]
*  led by a Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party, not a sort of technocratic Obama-esque, [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5535.4s)]
*  you know, Ezra Klein abundance liberalism wing. You're going to get a resurgent Bernieism on the [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5540.28s)]
*  left that basically says these rich people screwed you in order to get ahead. You can feel it [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5546.04s)]
*  because you're feeling the recession. They're still rich. You're still poor. And so what you [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5551.88s)]
*  really need is a complete rejiggering of the American economy along the lines of fairness. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5555.32s)]
*  And you're going to see something similar happen on the right, by the way. So my friend, [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5559.64s)]
*  Matt Contenetti, who is the former editor of the Washington Free Beacon, I believe, [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5563.0s)]
*  he has a great point about presidential elections. He makes the point that candidates don't become [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5568.68s)]
*  president unless they run against their own party. In order to actually capture the imagination of [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5573.24s)]
*  the American people, you almost always have to run inside your own party against your own party. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5579.24s)]
*  So you saw this most obviously with President Trump, but this was clearly true with Barack Obama. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5582.5199999999995s)]
*  It was true to a certain extent with George W. Bush, even, who ran a compassionate conservative [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5587.0s)]
*  campaign against these sort of hard-hearted Gingrich-Dole Republicans. Clinton for sure did [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5591.88s)]
*  this. So I think it's a great point because then you have to start thinking, OK, look at the, [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5597.5599999999995s)]
*  we're turning to the right side of the aisle now. Let's say that you have a politician on [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5601.48s)]
*  the right side of the aisle. What does he run against in the, because Trump has obviously taken [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5603.799999999999s)]
*  command, tremendous command of the Republican base and the Republican party. What is there to [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5607.879999999999s)]
*  run against? Well, there's an economic downturn. Do you think that they're going to run against [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5611.32s)]
*  Trump being not capitalist enough? Or do they think they're going to run against Trump being [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5614.679999999999s)]
*  too capitalist, too friendly? Exactly. And that's how you get a populist uprising on the right. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5618.36s)]
*  And what you end up with is a horseshoe theory politics where both parties are in favor of [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5623.0s)]
*  Lena Conn. Right, but both parties are in favor of Lena Conn. And by the way, this is not a rarity. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5626.52s)]
*  I mean, I think that the vice president is an amazingly brilliant guy. He has also expressed [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5631.080000000001s)]
*  kind of public support for Lena Conn from time to time, right? And that's inside the Republican [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5636.76s)]
*  party. And on the left, obviously, there's tremendous support for Lena Conn. So if what [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5640.52s)]
*  we're saying here is one of the things we need is not Lena Conn, we should be very careful not to [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5643.56s)]
*  step on the rake. And then the thing that hits you in the face is Lena Conn. Right. Yeah. Right. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5647.96s)]
*  And that's why I said my contrarian bet for this year was this rise in [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5652.2s)]
*  social policy and the response to some of the actions the administration might take. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5656.28s)]
*  But well, I mean, how do we avoid making the bottom half of society feel included in all this wealth [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5661.24s)]
*  generation, etc.? Like what is the plan here? Is it universal health care? Is it lowering their [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5669.08s)]
*  taxes? I mean, the administration says no taxes for people under 150k. We have to give something [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5675.48s)]
*  to the working man and woman of this country, the people who feel that they can't get rich, [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5681.4s)]
*  who can't get to the middle class. Does anybody here have a suggestion for that? [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5685.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, I do. I actually do have a suggestion. And it's actually shockingly easy. President Trump [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5689.16s)]
*  has a has a visceral connection to blue collar workers in this country. Yes, clearly has a [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5693.48s)]
*  visceral connection. He should stop preaching that blue collar workers are getting screwed and [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5698.36s)]
*  start preaching that they're succeeding, because it's actually true. Okay. Yes. Yes. I mean, [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5702.28s)]
*  I think that the the fib the politicians always make bank on is the idea that, for example, [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5706.76s)]
*  the middle class in America is completely dissolved. That is not statistically true. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5711.24s)]
*  The middle class has turned into the upper middle class. Okay. And actually, all Americans, [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5714.92s)]
*  I say this on my show all the time, people have this again, this sort of rosy eyed view of the [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5720.280000000001s)]
*  1950s, which again, was a historical outlier, because the rest of the world didn't exist had [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5724.76s)]
*  been destroyed. But they also have this bizarre idea that that you were better off to be 30 years [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5728.04s)]
*  old in 1980 than you are to be 30 years old in 2025. And all I can say is in 1980, the only dude [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5732.6s)]
*  with a cell phone was Gordon Gekko, and he was a shoebox and he was holding it to his head. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5737.240000000001s)]
*  Okay, the reality is that everything in your life is better in 2025 on a material economic level [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5740.360000000001s)]
*  than it was in 1980. And the lie that politicians tell in order to gain power is they say, [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5746.280000000001s)]
*  you're you're getting screwed, somebody is screwing you, I can unscrew the screwing. And so there's [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5752.200000000001s)]
*  there's this constant sort of race to the bottom in terms of this rhetoric. And what you end up [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5757.320000000001s)]
*  with is, in the end, what can I promise you that that I can then blame somebody else for not having [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5761.0s)]
*  fulfilled the promise, President Trump, I think could avoid that because of this unique connection [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5766.36s)]
*  that he has with blue collar people where he could say, listen, we're all on the same side here, [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5770.12s)]
*  right? What we're doing here is innovation. I thought the most important line that I heard [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5774.12s)]
*  from President Trump during his his victory speech the night that he won was he when he said to Elon, [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5777.08s)]
*  and it was kind of a throw line when he said we love our geniuses, or he said we love our geniuses. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5781.64s)]
*  And I thought, yes, that's the thing we need. Celebrate success. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5785.48s)]
*  And this could be you. And and not only and we're gonna have hiring programs, as Mark Andreessen [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5791.16s)]
*  has talked about, we need to have hiring programs that are that are specifically designed to find [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5795.4s)]
*  the best people, not just abroad, but also in the United States, who might be underserviced in rural [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5798.52s)]
*  areas of the country or in blue collar areas of the country, find the next JD Vans, find the next [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5803.64s)]
*  guy who really needs you know, that that hands up, like all those things can be done. A rising tide [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5807.88s)]
*  will lift all ships. But this is the problem with the short term pain plan. Americans have a long [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5812.84s)]
*  memory. And when it comes to politics, I think this happened with the Biden administration. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5818.52s)]
*  People, their relationship with politicians is sort of like a married couple and good married [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5823.72s)]
*  couples, you know, they kind of talk through the minor problems that they're having in their [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5828.4400000000005s)]
*  marriage. And then and then things, you know, continue to maintain and grow and get better. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5831.56s)]
*  Bad married couples, what happens is that they sort of ignore that the kind of minor annoyances [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5835.160000000001s)]
*  for years at a time, and then something bad happens in the bottom just goes right out. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5839.160000000001s)]
*  And this is the thing that I'm afraid of for the Trump administration. Everybody's willing to ignore [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5842.76s)]
*  the things that are kind of mildly annoying, like penguins at the White House or whatever, [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5846.68s)]
*  up until the point where there's a serious recession. At that point, everybody kind of looks [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5850.04s)]
*  around and goes, why are we even doing this? I think that's exactly what happened with Biden [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5853.96s)]
*  with the Afghanistan withdrawal, for example, making a misstep is the is the is why I'm being [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5856.68s)]
*  critical of the terrorists. It's not because I want Trump to lose is because I want Trump to win, [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5861.4800000000005s)]
*  right? I think he's doing too many important things. Like the stuff that Antonio's doing, [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5864.360000000001s)]
*  there are too many important things happening to to take to roll the dice on a strategy that [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5868.200000000001s)]
*  isn't even being articulated. If you're going to make the case for a long term gain, I need to [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5873.64s)]
*  know what the long term gain is so I can make the case to the American public as to why they should [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5877.88s)]
*  endure the short term pain. You know, you're having surgery because after the surgery, [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5881.4800000000005s)]
*  you're going to feel better. But if I say you're having surgeries, give me some short term pain, [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5884.280000000001s)]
*  you say, okay, how am I going to feel after the surgery? You say, well, I don't know. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5887.0s)]
*  You know, maybe, maybe, who knows? [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5890.92s)]
*  We have so many job openings, we have the lowest unemployment of our lifetime. As you said, [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5895.400000000001s)]
*  consumers today can get and live an incredible lifestyle that the rich didn't have in 1980. The [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5899.64s)]
*  car you can buy today can drive itself for 2030 40k, you can buy use Tesla and have this car [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5905.72s)]
*  that's better than any car made in the last 50 years. So get a keep it positive, then think [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5911.64s)]
*  about Generation Tool Belt. You've got all these, you know, plumbing jobs, electrician jobs, [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5915.64s)]
*  construction jobs that pay massively hourly wages that are available for people today. We have [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5920.76s)]
*  too many job openings today. And you never hear Trump say that to your point, it's always this [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5927.72s)]
*  life. Everything's a disaster. And I'll save you when in fact, you don't need saving. Go ahead, [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5931.64s)]
*  freebird. I'll answer to mobster earlier question about what America can anchor to, [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5935.88s)]
*  to attract the rest of the world. And I think it's what's been the American story from the beginning, [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5941.96s)]
*  which is ambition. We pioneered the West, we launched the Industrial Revolution, we went to [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5947.4800000000005s)]
*  space, we landed on the moon, we had the Manhattan Project, we unleashed the information technology [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5954.76s)]
*  revolution with the development of the transistor. The ambition is what's been kind of consumed by [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5963.4800000000005s)]
*  China. In the last 20 years, they've built 30,000 miles of high speed rail. In the next 15 years, [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5971.24s)]
*  they're going to add more electricity production capacity than the United States times two [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5977.4800000000005s)]
*  has today. There's nothing short of ambition coming out of China. And it's what we're lacking [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5984.52s)]
*  all of our political gambits, all of our debates are all centered around what we're trying to fix [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5991.72s)]
*  that went wrong in the past, what we did wrong, and what we got to do to make it right. And we [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=5998.52s)]
*  don't talk at all about the ambition of where we can lead the world to next. China is the only one [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6003.160000000001s)]
*  that's doing that. And I think that's where we need to kind of have a bit of an important pivot [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6007.080000000001s)]
*  on the global stage if we want to be able to kind of attract partners, and also to have Americans [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6012.120000000001s)]
*  think outside of this week, where are we headed? And I just I don't know. I mean, I don't know if [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6017.400000000001s)]
*  you guys agree. But I just feel like that's one of the key things that we've kind of lost track of. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6021.96s)]
*  NERC put out a study just like this is very tactical, but it's part and parcel of what you [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6025.72s)]
*  and Jason are talking about. Do you guys know that about 25% of all of our utility workers in America [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6031.56s)]
*  became eligible for retirement between 2017 and 2022? I did not know. So most of the people, [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6038.92s)]
*  56% of all utility workers now have less than a decade of experience. You know what that's resulted [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6045.96s)]
*  in? In 2021, the average US customer of an electric utility experience seven and a half hours of service [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6050.68s)]
*  interruptions, and it's just growing. I think the average plumbers age NERC 50 something, [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6058.52s)]
*  we can't get people to become plumbers. NERC says that 19 states now in the United States can face [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6064.84s)]
*  rolling blackouts during normal peak conditions if these issues aren't addressed. And by the way, [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6070.04s)]
*  this is that's a human capital problem. But if you multiply that by 10 and 20 and 30 times, [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6074.4400000000005s)]
*  there was a different tweet. I don't know, Nick, if you could find it, that talked about an [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6080.52s)]
*  organization trying to find people to help build nuclear submarines. Did you guys see this quote, [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6084.84s)]
*  where they needed 100,000 people to build nuclear subs in the United States, [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6089.320000000001s)]
*  and they could barely find like a few hundred? [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6095.24s)]
*  Yeah, we need to get better at this stuff. I mean, the good news is, we're going to have robots to [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6098.92s)]
*  do this. Ben, you know, if I run for president, I'm one of the few people here on the pod who can, [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6103.8s)]
*  my position is going to be build three new cities with 5 million homes in each because, [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6109.24s)]
*  you know, starter homes, families can't buy starter homes. You ever consider running for [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6115.24s)]
*  office? And if you did, what would be your platform? I mean, it'd be pretty horrifying [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6118.84s)]
*  to run for office. It seems like a terrible job. And I think the age to run for president is now [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6121.8s)]
*  in your 70s. So I have like three decades to consider it. But, you know, if I were going to [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6126.2s)]
*  run, I would be running on the basic idea that in this country, the only thing that you are promised [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6131.32s)]
*  is the adventure. And, and I'm not going to make you promises that I'm not going to lie to you, [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6137.88s)]
*  I'm not going to make you promises that I can't keep about how I'm going to fix your life, [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6143.64s)]
*  because the truth is, I really can't. All I can do is help get the obstacles out of the way so you [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6146.84s)]
*  can fix your life and you can make your life better. And I can help break the institutions [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6150.92s)]
*  that have a stranglehold on your future. And there, when you're talking about electricians [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6154.6s)]
*  and plumbers, the truth is that we have set up an enormous con game that is our higher education [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6158.68s)]
*  system, particularly in the liberal arts, subsidized by the taxpayer, when most jobs [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6163.240000000001s)]
*  that we're talking about right here do not require a college degree. There's so many things that the [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6168.12s)]
*  Trump administration should be doing and is doing that again, they're great, that they could break [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6172.2s)]
*  the stranglehold on some of these things that allow for more opportunity. But I think the thing [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6176.5199999999995s)]
*  that people really, you know, the thing that I would say that I really think that maybe no other [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6180.5199999999995s)]
*  politician would say, and I can say, because I'm not a politician is your future is in America, [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6184.28s)]
*  your future is in your hands. It is not somebody else's hands. It is your responsibility. It is [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6188.679999999999s)]
*  your responsibility to go out and strive. It is your responsibility to go and succeed. We want you [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6193.96s)]
*  to be able to try again if you fail, but we want you to go and we want you to try. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6198.76s)]
*  Rugged individualism. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6203.64s)]
*  And also, you know, the kind of case that was being made a little bit earlier about China, [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6205.320000000001s)]
*  that basically China is saying that it can do things. One of the things that drives me up a [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6211.4800000000005s)]
*  wall is when politicians say, I created X jobs, or we created X jobs, you didn't create a job. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6216.84s)]
*  Okay, the government does not create jobs. The government can take money from people and then [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6223.08s)]
*  give it to other people. But it is only entrepreneurs who can create jobs. And so the [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6226.12s)]
*  way that you fight China off is not by the power of a centralized government directing people in a [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6231.0s)]
*  particular direction. The way that you fight off China is by unleashing the collective knowledge, [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6235.64s)]
*  wisdom and ambition of the American people on an individual level to go out and do all of these [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6240.36s)]
*  unbelievable things. And that would be the promise that I'd make to the American people. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6244.68s)]
*  So I'll get everybody the hell out of your way so you can succeed. That would be the only thing I [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6247.5599999999995s)]
*  would promise. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6250.84s)]
*  Guys, we got a breaking news here. It turns out the more reciprocal tariffs have dropped. Look at [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6251.16s)]
*  this. complaining about the docket. J Cal has put a 500% reciprocal tariff on that tariff on that. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6257.48s)]
*  Purchasing dogs from a breeder is now 100% tariff Friedberg. That's pretty, that's pretty stiff. And [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6265.08s)]
*  Chamath has put one on Laura Piana slippers. Yeah, too many people have them 200% tariff. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6271.32s)]
*  And oh, looks like Ben Shapiro gun and on it having Candace Owens on your podcast is now a 200%. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6276.919999999999s)]
*  Ben, what are you doing here? I mean, this is guys unkind. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6284.5199999999995s)]
*  Wait, what's the lucky one? Can you can you read that one? [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6287.4s)]
*  This is the biggest one that just dropped 1000% tariff. I'm working with J Cal for [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6291.48s)]
*  Chamath Pali hoppitya. Oh, you want to chairman dictator? Wait, I have to do you want to hear [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6298.04s)]
*  about Oh, would you like to do a little memory lane? We got so much show here. I'm trying to [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6302.04s)]
*  get this out. But okay, by the way, I created a polymarket on GDP. Oh, annualized GDP growth [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6304.76s)]
*  in Q3 of this year being below five, negative 5%. Negative 5%. Yeah. That's brutal. Check it out. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6311.400000000001s)]
*  Try market. What's the probability of that happening? Make your bets. Oh, make your bets [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6319.4800000000005s)]
*  with our partner polymarket. Chamath, do you want to do victory lab? We're gonna wrap here. What do [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6323.96s)]
*  you want to do? Well, I actually think it's fun, because we're going to kick off a different poly [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6329.8s)]
*  market around this because I think it's interesting. So the thing that we haven't talked about is with [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6333.64s)]
*  all of the tariffs, with all of the financing questions, with all of the recession questions, [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6338.6s)]
*  short term rates, long term rates, the one thing that we haven't sufficiently talked about, [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6346.68s)]
*  it's not really in the press, but it needs to be talked about is there is a tremendous amount of [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6351.4800000000005s)]
*  corporate debt that supports these businesses today. And you would say, well, if long term [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6355.72s)]
*  rates go down, there's no real risk, but the tariff picture actually impacts revenues, right? [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6362.68s)]
*  And the problem with that is that there's a lot of companies that have debt covenants tied to [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6371.72s)]
*  revenue and EBITDA. And so this is what I spoke about at the beginning of January, which is [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6376.92s)]
*  the one risk that is uncontrollable is what happens to corporate debt. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6383.8s)]
*  And could we see a wave of defaults and a wave of action? Nick, you may want to just play the [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6391.0s)]
*  clip and we can talk about what we can do about this. This was my pick for the best investment idea. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6396.28s)]
*  Go ahead. Here we go. Let me preface this by saying that this is a pick that 92 times out of 100 goes [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6402.84s)]
*  to absolute zero and six out of the remaining eight times you make 10 extra money. And then [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6411.88s)]
*  the final two times you make anywhere between a hundred to a thousand extra money. This is a [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6419.72s)]
*  loser trade, but I would be long CDS. So what am I buying? I am buying insurance. I'm buying [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6424.2s)]
*  insurance using credit default swaps. I'm buying what's called protection that there is no [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6432.76s)]
*  default event in 2025. I would like a little bit of an insurance policy in 2025 [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6438.92s)]
*  so that the men and the women that we have voted in have the chance to do their work in peace. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6446.68s)]
*  I think that there is a small chance of some volatility next year. I hope it doesn't happen. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6452.28s)]
*  I hope that this trade loses money, but if it hits, it will be the best performing asset of 2025. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6458.6s)]
*  And I just want to be clear. This is not something I think will happen. It's not something I want to [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6464.36s)]
*  happen. But I do think that if you look back in terms of just the tonnage of dollars you can make [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6468.04s)]
*  and the massive risk asymmetry that it presents to you, when you look at the concentration of [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6473.4s)]
*  the S and P, when you look at just the total gross amount of debt that we have, when you [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6477.48s)]
*  look at rates spiking, all of these things say having a little insurance may not be a bad thing. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6481.72s)]
*  It has hit Nick. You can show the CDS graph. So this thing for every billion dollars of risk [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6487.4s)]
*  you would have put on, every billion dollars that you put on would have cost you about a million [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6495.72s)]
*  dollars. And that million dollars would have made you about $7 million in about three months. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6499.88s)]
*  Did you put it on? [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6505.08s)]
*  I'm not going to comment on my trades, Jason. But we talked about it off air already. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6506.4400000000005s)]
*  But if you did put it on, does that mean you're taking us all to Italy this summer? [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6512.84s)]
*  No. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6516.92s)]
*  What's happening here? Are you getting a boat for us to record from the All-in Yacht? [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6517.16s)]
*  No, but there may be some boats for sale if this trade keeps going this way. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6520.76s)]
*  Oh, why is this important? The CDS actually represents the structural risk in the United [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6524.360000000001s)]
*  States private economy, in the corporate economy. And so Nick, if you just put it back on. So when [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6529.64s)]
*  you see these spreads blowing out, this is actually a very important warning sign. And this is actually [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6534.360000000001s)]
*  a thing that I think Scott understands well, Howard understands well. I think they'll translate this [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6539.96s)]
*  to the president. If I have an opportunity to explain it, I will. But this is a really [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6546.04s)]
*  important market to pay attention to. This is what was the canary in the coal mine for [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6551.4s)]
*  the great financial crisis. This was the stuff that showed us that there was a big [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6558.28s)]
*  default event happening in the mortgage side of the market. But then that spilled over [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6563.16s)]
*  to the broader economy. And so the tariff picture and the recession picture will get [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6567.4s)]
*  played out in this chart. And I think it's something that folks can and should probably [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6573.4s)]
*  pay tremendous attention to because I think now that this trade is in the money, the question is, [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6578.28s)]
*  I don't think we want this to happen that one sigma to sigma event where all of a sudden this [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6584.04s)]
*  trade returns 1000 X is really bad. Well, you know, let's keep our eye on the markets. And [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6589.08s)]
*  as of the taping here, we're down about 5% across the boards and excellent. You should come back. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6595.88s)]
*  Yeah, well done. And you fit right in. We're in Florida. Are you we're doing an event in Miami [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6603.24s)]

*  PE ratios on the Newsmax trade are, are, you know, ridiculous in the sense that it's going to revert [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6703.72s)]
*  back to something closer to normalcy. I think that the, that it was supposed to trade at 10 bucks [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6709.24s)]
*  and it came out at 14. It spoke to like 240. So it's more like GameStop than anything else. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6713.64s)]
*  There's a lot of retail traders who are fans of Newsmax who bought the stock and then it leapt. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6718.2s)]

*  range, somewhere three to four bill, something like that. I think what it says is that, you know, [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6731.48s)]
*  the, the stock market in the short term is a voting machine and in the long term, it is a weighing [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6736.84s)]
*  machine. And I think that, you know, when, when you, when you look at stocks that have name brand [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6740.76s)]
*  recognition, then you're going to get a lot of voting in the early going. And then it's a [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6745.72s)]
*  question of whether you can keep that up. So it turns into weighing. Right. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6749.64s)]
*  39 million in quarterly revenue. So they're at 150, 160 million dollars a year and their valuation [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6752.76s)]

*  or something? Oh no. When it went in peak, it peaked above 20 bill. Yeah. The market cap. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhA9p3ZXW0&t=6764.92s)]
