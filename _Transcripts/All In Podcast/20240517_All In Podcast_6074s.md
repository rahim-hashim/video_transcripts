*  And he leaked every single person who's there and the jets and the jet numbers. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=179.92000000000002s)]

*  No, no, no. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  It was worse than that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=188.32000000000002s)]
*  No, it's worse than that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  He's like, I got to hang out with our guy Elon for 10 minutes and 14 seconds. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=195.2s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=196.0s)]
*  He died. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  He intercepted him at the valet. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=198.32s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=202.08s)]
*  How many minutes? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=204.32s)]
*  10 minutes and 14 seconds. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=205.76s)]
*  He had the exact time down to the second. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=207.2s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=209.04s)]
*  Well, listen, I want to wish Phil Helm a happy birthday because I did miss his 60th party. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=209.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's coming up. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  Actually, his birthday's not going to be too much. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=215.36s)]
*  The good news is it wasn't actually his birthday. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=216.56s)]
*  It was Bill Gurley's. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=217.84s)]
*  So he just hijacked Bill Gurley's birthday. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=218.8s)]
*  I also got to enjoy for my first time ever the experience of Baccarat, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=221.2s)]
*  which I've decided is the most degen game on Earth. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  It's literally the most you just flip a coin. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=228.64s)]
*  It's flipping coins. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=231.76s)]
*  Well, craps is really... [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=233.28s)]
*  You make betting decisions. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=234.72s)]
*  All you do in Baccarat is you say thing or player, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=235.92s)]
*  and then you freak yourself out about how you flip the cards. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=239.44s)]
*  And the smartest people I know on Earth are all sitting around this table at 2 or 3 in the morning [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=241.83999999999997s)]
*  saying, turn this corner this way. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=248.23999999999998s)]
*  Turn it this way. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=249.04s)]
*  Turn it this way. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=249.84s)]
*  There's two dots and they're debating the right way to flip a card over. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=250.56s)]
*  It's just fever. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=254.0s)]
*  The smartest people on Earth. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=254.48s)]
*  No, the Baccarat of Sweat is the most incredible performative act in the disney. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  It's the weirdest thing. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=260.4s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=262.0s)]
*  Everyone's got their own little technique about how they bend the cards. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=262.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=265.44s)]
*  It's all destroyed by the end of the deck. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=266.0s)]
*  They get thrown out. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  I go lengthwise. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=269.04s)]
*  I go like this and I try to see. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=270.16s)]
*  Oh, like you're curling your mustache like an evil villain? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=272.0s)]
*  Yeah, like this. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=274.4s)]
*  You got to go like this. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=274.56s)]
*  And then you call it, oh my God, no spotter. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=276.48s)]
*  If you see a no spotter. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=278.48s)]
*  Or two cross. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=279.68s)]
*  And then you get to decide whether the bank turns over their cards and when they turn over. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=282.48s)]
*  Then you lose a small house and then you're like, oh, let's try it again. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, you're convincing yourself that you have all this control and ways to change the outcome. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=289.36s)]
*  You're literally flipping a card. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=293.52000000000004s)]
*  It's high card. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=294.72s)]
*  Well, it's basically high card. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=295.44s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=296.48s)]
*  It's high card. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  It's even worse than that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=297.76s)]
*  You're basically sitting down at the casino's table and then they tell you whether you've [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=298.64000000000004s)]
*  won or lost. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  And in order to convince yourself that that's not what's going on, you have to play with the card. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=303.52000000000004s)]
*  But really, they just tell you, you either win or lose. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  And I'm watching the smartest guys we know staring at the window at the little machine [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  that tells you whether bank or player one. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=317.04s)]
*  And they're studying it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  Helmuth is like, I'm calling it now, bank, bank, player, player, player. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=325.76s)]
*  And all the guys are like, let's do it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=329.04s)]
*  And then everyone's like, okay. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=330.16s)]
*  So Helmuth asked us to play in the high stakes poker game on PokerGo. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=332.24s)]
*  So it was me, Helmuth, Stanley, Sammy, House, and then Jen Tilly and Nick Aireball and Robl. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=337.44s)]
*  So most of the guys from the Huskies plus Jen Tilly and Nick Aireball. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=344.96s)]
*  Jennifer Tilly is amazing. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=348.96s)]
*  What a great human. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=350.32s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=351.2s)]
*  Well, listen to this hand. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=352.08s)]
*  Literally, the second hand of the actual poker game. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  Jen Tilly is in the big blind. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=360.96s)]
*  No, sorry. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  She's under the gun. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=366.64s)]
*  She raises. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=367.84s)]
*  House and bold three bets. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=369.12s)]
*  It comes all the way around to me on the button. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=370.8s)]
*  I look and I have pocket Kings. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=373.12s)]
*  I ship the whole cheeseburger comes back to Tilly. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=376.88s)]
*  She ships House ships. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  Listen to these hands. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=382.08s)]
*  Jen Tilly has aces. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=383.52s)]
*  Jeff House and bold has Kings. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=385.84s)]
*  I have Kings. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=387.28s)]
*  I've never seen a cooler hand like this in my life. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=389.2s)]
*  And the second in the second hand of the game. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=393.36s)]
*  Anyways, don't worry guys. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=396.08000000000004s)]
*  I came back and I want to tell you. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=398.24s)]
*  She triples up and then into lockdown mode. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=402.88000000000005s)]
*  The first time I ever played with her. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=405.36s)]
*  I know that I stacked her right. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=406.56s)]
*  And I said, anyways, well, I don't want to reveal the game, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=408.24s)]
*  but it was wonderful. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=410.24s)]
*  I show up at a mutual friend of ours game and there's a like beautiful Porsche or something [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=412.40000000000003s)]
*  in the driveway is a really notable car. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=417.04s)]
*  And the I noticed on the license plate says DJ. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=418.96000000000004s)]
*  But it's spelled with a J and I'm like, oh, degenerate. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=422.72s)]
*  What a great license plate. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=425.20000000000005s)]
*  I wonder who's that is. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=426.24s)]
*  I go in. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=426.88000000000005s)]
*  It's Jennifer Tilly. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=427.20000000000005s)]
*  She is so cool. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=428.88000000000005s)]

*  Great. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=432.16s)]
*  Very cool. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=432.56s)]
*  Very charmed. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=432.88000000000005s)]
*  Great actress. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  Great movie. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  She was in. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=434.64000000000004s)]
*  Bound. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=436.48s)]
*  That's what it was. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=436.88000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=437.68s)]
*  You don't have to ask me twice. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=438.18s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=439.6s)]
*  That is toward the force. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=440.0s)]
*  What a great gangster film. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=441.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=443.44000000000005s)]
*  With Gina Gershon. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=444.16s)]
*  I mean, Gina Gershon. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=445.68s)]
*  That's it. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=446.64000000000004s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=447.20000000000005s)]
*  That film. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=448.16s)]
*  That film. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=449.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, let's not get canceled here. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=450.08000000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=451.28000000000003s)]
*  It is quite a film. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=452.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=454.0s)]
*  Speaking of action. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=454.64000000000004s)]
*  Big week. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=458.88000000000005s)]
*  The AI industrial complex is dominating our docket here. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=459.68s)]
*  Apologies to Biden, Ukraine and Nikki Haley. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=463.12s)]
*  But we got to go AI right now. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=465.36s)]
*  Open AI. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=466.88000000000005s)]
*  Launch chat. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=468.0s)]
*  GPT-40. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=468.64000000000004s)]
*  4.0. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=470.56s)]
*  Monday, three days after Sam Wise came on All In as a programming note. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=472.24s)]
*  And we'll go to Freiburg about this. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=477.36s)]
*  We probably made a bit of a strategical or tactical error in not postponing his appearance. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=479.44s)]
*  In fairness, Freiburg, Sam Wise did tell us originally he was coming on to talk about [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=485.91999999999996s)]
*  those things, but then it got pushed back. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=490.56s)]
*  Anything you want to add to that as a programming note? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=492.24s)]
*  Because people are wondering. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=495.12s)]
*  What happened? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=496.71999999999997s)]
*  I've been talking with Sam for a while. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=498.08s)]
*  A year. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=500.71999999999997s)]
*  About coming on the show. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=501.28s)]
*  And every time I see him, we're like, hey, you should come on the show. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=502.24s)]
*  He's like, I want to come on the show. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=504.64s)]
*  Okay, let's find a date. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=505.59999999999997s)]
*  We never got a date that worked. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=506.96s)]
*  I saw him in March and he said, hey, I want to come on the show. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=508.64s)]
*  I said, okay, well, come on. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=511.28s)]
*  Let me know when works. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=513.04s)]
*  And a couple of weeks later, he's like, what about this date in May? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=513.92s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, that's fine. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=517.36s)]
*  We can make that work. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=518.72s)]
*  He's like, well, I've got a big announcement we're going to be doing. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=520.0s)]
*  And I was like, perfect. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=522.88s)]
*  Come on the show. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=523.68s)]
*  That sounds great. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=524.64s)]
*  And then the night before, he asked me, he told me, he texted me, he's like, hey, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=525.92s)]
*  we're actually not going to have this announcement happen tomorrow. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=531.12s)]
*  It's going to be delayed. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=534.48s)]
*  He didn't tell me how long. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=535.36s)]
*  And I'm like, well, is it GPT-5? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=536.16s)]
*  He's like, no, it's not GPT-5. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=538.08s)]
*  And I was like, okay, well, you know, come on the show anyway. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=540.0s)]
*  Because he didn't tell me when he's doing the announcement [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=542.64s)]
*  or when it's being pushed to. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=544.24s)]
*  So it didn't seem like that big a deal. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=545.12s)]
*  And I thought we were just going to be able to have a good chat anyway. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=546.96s)]
*  So it's really unfortunate, I think, the fact that the announcement happened [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=549.12s)]
*  two days after and he had to stay quiet about it during our interview. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=552.0s)]
*  But that's the story. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=555.44s)]
*  I think in the future, if someone says they've got a big announcement to do, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=556.8000000000001s)]
*  we should probably push them if they have to go away or something like that. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=559.2800000000001s)]
*  But don't beat yourself up. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=562.96s)]
*  But I don't think we're going to be doing a lot of these interviews anyway. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=564.08s)]
*  I think people clearly don't love them. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=566.0s)]
*  And it's better for us to just kind of hang out and talk. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=567.92s)]
*  I think if we had just gotten Sam on the day after the launch of GPT-4 Omni, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=571.92s)]
*  as opposed to what was it, three days before, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=578.24s)]
*  he could have talked much more freely about it. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=581.1999999999999s)]
*  And it would have been interesting. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=582.7199999999999s)]
*  It was supposed to happen same day. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=584.4799999999999s)]
*  So it's unfortunate this all worked out this way. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=585.68s)]
*  The other little trick is to say you can tell us under embargo. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=587.28s)]
*  But my understanding is they were still doing the videos over the weekend. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=590.8s)]
*  So I think those videos and stuff, they were still figuring them out. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=595.04s)]
*  And so, yeah, lesson learned. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=598.7199999999999s)]
*  In terms of the interviews on the show, just to recap for people, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=600.24s)]
*  we've done a dozen. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=603.76s)]
*  Half of them have been presidential candidates. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=605.36s)]
*  Sometimes they break out. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=607.36s)]
*  Sometimes they don't. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=608.4s)]
*  We follow our interest and our passion here on the pod. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=610.0s)]
*  It's got to be interesting for us, too. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=613.8399999999999s)]
*  So if we think this person is going to be interesting, we do it. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=615.1999999999999s)]
*  And yeah, we understand you miss a news subject, but yeah, it is what it is. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=617.5999999999999s)]
*  And to your point, a lot of the people that come on, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=621.6s)]
*  and increasingly a lot of people ask to come on because they know we're not journalists. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=625.52s)]
*  And so for all of those folks that expect us to be journalists, that's not what we are. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=629.36s)]
*  We're for entrepreneurs. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=636.5600000000001s)]
*  We're for business people. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=637.76s)]
*  We're for friends. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=638.8000000000001s)]
*  We're for technologists. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=639.6800000000001s)]
*  We're for curious people. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=640.64s)]
*  We're for poker players. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=641.6800000000001s)]
*  But we're not for journalists. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=643.9200000000001s)]
*  And so we're going to ask whatever we feel like asking. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=646.0s)]
*  Sometimes those things will touch a chord because it's what you wanted to have asked. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=649.2800000000001s)]
*  And sometimes we won't go to a place whether we didn't have time to or whether we forgot [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=653.44s)]
*  or whether we chose not to. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=658.72s)]
*  And I think it's important to have that disclaimer. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=660.24s)]
*  We have day jobs and this is what we do to coalesce a bunch of information in the way [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=662.6400000000001s)]
*  that we're thinking about the world. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=668.72s)]
*  So we are not journalists. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=670.1600000000001s)]
*  So please don't have that expectation. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=672.1600000000001s)]
*  I think what that means is that if the guest doesn't want to talk about something, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=673.6800000000001s)]
*  we're not going to start peppering him with gotcha questions and things like that. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=677.76s)]
*  I appeared at a conference a couple of days ago to promote GLUE, which we'll get to. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=682.72s)]
*  And the first half of the conversation was like a normal conversation about what we were [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=687.6s)]
*  launching. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=691.52s)]
*  And then the second half was basically the reporter peppering me with fastball questions, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=691.84s)]
*  which is fine. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=696.16s)]
*  I knew what I was signing up for. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=696.88s)]
*  It's a totally different style. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=698.4s)]
*  It's a totally different style than coming on the pod and just having a normal conversation. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=699.84s)]
*  But it's not really our job to make somebody open up if they don't want to talk. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=703.28s)]
*  What was the spiciest question, Sax? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=707.76s)]
*  What was the fastball? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=709.76s)]
*  Anything come close to your head? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=710.64s)]
*  No, I mean, it's not worth really getting into. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=713.36s)]
*  You can watch it if you want. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=715.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I was just curious. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=716.3199999999999s)]
*  Look, I kind of like sometimes when reporters pitch me fastballs because, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=717.36s)]
*  yeah, you can strike out or you can hit it out of the park when they do that. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=721.52s)]
*  That's an important part here. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=724.3199999999999s)]
*  I think, you know, as a former editor in chief journalist myself, I sometimes like to ask, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=725.8399999999999s)]
*  I would say, a challenging question in a respectful way. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=731.76s)]
*  I did that, for example, vague, you know, just clarifying his thoughts on trans and gay rights. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=734.72s)]
*  Wasn't disrespectful, was thoughtful. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=741.28s)]
*  Would you consider it spicy or hardcore? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=744.3199999999999s)]
*  I don't think it was hardcore. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=746.16s)]
*  He likes to talk about it. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=747.28s)]
*  No, but that's because you asked it from a position of curiosity. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=748.56s)]
*  You weren't trying to catch the guy. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=751.2s)]
*  No. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=752.88s)]
*  You see the difference? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=753.12s)]
*  I'm actually interested in his opinion. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=753.6s)]
*  Look, this is my point. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=755.12s)]
*  That's why it comes out differently. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=756.24s)]
*  And that's why I think people enjoy these conversations. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=757.6s)]
*  And sometimes we don't get to the other kind of answer because I'm not interested in trying [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=760.0s)]
*  to gotcha somebody that's working hard. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=764.96s)]
*  I always have the same conditions when I do interviews, which is I don't clear questions [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=766.96s)]
*  and I don't let people edit it. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=770.56s)]
*  But, you know, everybody's got a different view on how to do interviews and feel a difference. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=771.76s)]
*  If you like it, you like it. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=776.64s)]
*  If you like Lex Friedman's version or Tim Ferriss' version, or you prefer, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=777.6s)]
*  you know, Fox or CNN, go watch those interviews there. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=782.56s)]
*  You can have a whole range of different interviews and interview styles available to you in the media [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=785.36s)]
*  landscape. We are but one. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=789.84s)]
*  Sam Weiss mentioned on the pod last week that the next big model might not be called GPT-5. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=791.36s)]
*  So on Monday, they launched GPT-4-O. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=797.12s)]
*  The O stands for Omni. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=800.4s)]
*  It's everything you love about tech. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=802.32s)]
*  It's faster, it's cheaper, it's better. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=804.32s)]
*  But from my perspective, the real show was the massive amount of progress they made on the UI-UX. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=806.48s)]
*  The O stands for Omni as in omnivore. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=812.96s)]
*  It takes in audio, text, images, even your desktop and video from your camera [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=815.52s)]
*  to inform what it's doing. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=820.56s)]
*  You can consider it like 360 degree AI. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=822.16s)]
*  Producer Nick will show a couple of videos while I describe them here before we go to the besties [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=825.52s)]
*  for the reaction to the announcement. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=829.52s)]
*  First, they made great progress in solving the CB problem we mentioned last week. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=831.4399999999999s)]
*  That's where like when you use Siri or any of these tools, you say, you know, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=836.24s)]
*  Hey, JetGPT, what's 2 plus 2 over and you have to wait. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=839.6s)]
*  And then if you talk over each other, it breaks. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=842.72s)]
*  They now have that working much smoother. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=845.1199999999999s)]
*  They did an example of counting where they said, speed up, slow down. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=847.92s)]
*  They did a translator that worked really well. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=851.1999999999999s)]
*  I would like you to function as a translator. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=853.76s)]
*  I have a friend here who only speaks Italian and I only speak English. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=855.76s)]
*  And every time you hear English, I want you to translate it to Italian. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=859.52s)]
*  And if you hear Italian, I want you to translate it back to English. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=862.8s)]
*  Is that good? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=865.28s)]
*  Mike, she wonders if whales could talk, what would they tell us? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=874.56s)]
*  They might ask, how do we solve linear equations? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=882.16s)]
*  Certainly, yes. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=896.56s)]
*  Great. Looks like it works. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=898.16s)]
*  I think Duengo stock took a hit during that. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=900.0s)]
*  Most impressive, to me at least, and also I had Sandeep Madhra on my other podcast [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=902.48s)]
*  and we talked about it was their desktop and iOS app. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=908.08s)]
*  What this app does is fascinating. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=911.6800000000001s)]
*  It watches your desktop on your Macintosh or on your iPad or iPhone. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=913.76s)]
*  And it does things like adaptive learning. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=919.84s)]
*  Here's a clip of Sal Khan from Khan Academy and his son, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=923.04s)]
*  basically using a drawing app to do some arithmetic or geometry. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=926.88s)]
*  And it does adaptive learning and basically makes a personal coach [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=932.24s)]
*  because the app is watching his son try to solve a problem. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=935.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm here with my son and I'd love you to tutor him on this math problem. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=939.6800000000001s)]
*  But don't give him the answer. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=945.28s)]
*  You can ask questions and nudge him in the right direction. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=946.5600000000001s)]
*  But I really want to make sure he understands it himself. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=948.88s)]
*  And he's here in the room so you can talk to him directly. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=952.16s)]
*  Can you first identify which sides of the triangle are the opposite adjacent? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=954.8000000000001s)]
*  And hypotenuse relative to angle alpha? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=961.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=965.9200000000001s)]
*  So I'm pretty sure this is the angle alpha right here, right? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=966.5600000000001s)]
*  Fict. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=970.64s)]
*  Current's correct. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=971.52s)]
*  Now, looking at the triangle, which side do you think is the hypotenuse? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=972.8000000000001s)]
*  Remember the hypotenuse? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=979.76s)]
*  I'm not totally sure. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=981.36s)]
*  I think it might be this one, but I really am not sure. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=984.0s)]
*  This side AC. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=987.12s)]
*  You're close. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=989.36s)]
*  Actually, side AC is called the adjacent side to the angle alpha. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=990.64s)]
*  The hypotenuse is the longest side of a right triangle [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=995.84s)]
*  and is directly opposite the right angle. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=999.36s)]
*  Can you find which one is the hypotenuse? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1002.5600000000001s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1004.96s)]
*  I see. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1005.76s)]
*  So I think the hypotenuse is this really long side from A to B. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1006.32s)]
*  Would that be correct? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1011.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1013.6800000000001s)]
*  Well done. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1014.6400000000001s)]
*  It can also participate in Zoom calls, explain charts, all that great stuff. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1015.84s)]
*  It's going to be your guide on the side. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1020.32s)]
*  It's going to be a present personality while you're using your apps. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1022.0s)]
*  It's really impressive, I have to say. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1026.4s)]
*  So I guess let's start, Freeberg, with your takeaways on all of these innovations that we saw. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1028.32s)]
*  I think it's become quite apparent that there's an evolution underway in model architecture. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1034.64s)]
*  We've, and I think you may remember, we talked about this briefly with Sam last week, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1043.2s)]
*  but we're moving away from these very big, bulky models that are released every couple of months [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1047.04s)]
*  or quarters and cost a lot of money to rebuild every time they get re-released towards a system [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1054.8s)]
*  of models. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1061.68s)]
*  So this multimodal system basically leverages several models at once that work together [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1063.2s)]
*  or that are linked together to respond to the inputs and to provide some generative output. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1069.04s)]
*  And that those individual models themselves can be continuously tuned and or continuously updated. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1075.76s)]
*  So rather than have, hey, there's this big new release that just happened, this new model just [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1081.84s)]
*  got trained, cost $10 million to train it, it's been pushed. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1086.24s)]
*  These models can be upgraded with tuning, with upgrade features, and then linked together with [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1089.44s)]
*  other new smaller models that are perhaps specialized for specific tasks like doing [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1094.8s)]
*  mathematics or rendering an image or rendering a movie. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1099.04s)]
*  And so I think what we're going to see is soon more of an obfuscation of the individual [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1102.24s)]
*  models and more of this general service type approach where the updates are happening in [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1109.4399999999998s)]
*  a more continuous fashion. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1115.1999999999998s)]
*  I think this is the first step of OpenAI taking that architectural approach with GPT-4.0. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1116.24s)]
*  And what's behind the curtains, we don't know. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1123.1999999999998s)]
*  We don't know how many models are there. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1125.12s)]
*  We don't know how frequently they're being changed, whether they're being changed through [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1126.32s)]
*  actually upgrading the parameters or whether they're being fine-tuned. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1129.36s)]
*  And so this seems to be pretty obvious. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1133.4399999999998s)]
*  If you look at this link, one of the criticisms that initially came out when they released GPT-4.0 [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1134.8799999999999s)]
*  was that there was some performance degradation. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1142.1599999999999s)]
*  And Stanford actually runs this massive multitask language understanding assessment. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1146.4799999999998s)]
*  And they publish it, I think, daily or pretty frequently on how all the models perform. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1152.9599999999998s)]
*  And you can see the scorecard here that GPT-4.0 actually outperforms GPT-4. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1157.28s)]
*  And so this goes counter to some of the narrative that in order to get some of the performance [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1162.72s)]
*  improvements and speed improvements they got in 4.0 that they actually made the model worse. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1166.0800000000002s)]
*  So it seems actually the opposite is true that the model has gotten slightly better. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1170.48s)]
*  It still underperforms Cloud 3 Opus, which you can see here ranks top of these charts. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1173.3600000000001s)]
*  But there's lots of different charts. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1178.24s)]
*  All the companies publish their own charts. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1179.28s)]
*  They all claim that they're better than everyone else. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1180.88s)]
*  But I like Stanford because it's independent. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1182.8s)]
*  Chamath, any thoughts after seeing it in combination with our interview? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1184.48s)]
*  Do you think CHAT GPT is running away with the consumer experience? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1188.96s)]
*  Or do you think this is like neck and neck with some of the other players? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1194.0s)]
*  Not to tell tales out of school, but somebody that we all know in our group chat [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1197.2800000000002s)]
*  posted something about the fact that the consumer growth had stalled. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1201.76s)]
*  I don't know how they knew that. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1206.16s)]
*  Maybe they got some data or maybe they're an investor. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1208.24s)]
*  You guys know what I'm talking about. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1212.0s)]
*  And they said that they're trying to reinvigorate growth into the consumer app at OpenAI. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1214.0800000000002s)]
*  I mean, I think this is- Any insights as to why it might be plateauing in your perspective? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1219.2s)]
*  I wrote this in my annual letter, but there are these phases of growth. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1223.68s)]
*  And when you look at social networks as a perfect example, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1230.0800000000002s)]
*  Friendster was magical when it was first created. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1233.68s)]
*  And then you had MySpace that just ran circles around them because Friendster didn't really [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1237.1200000000001s)]
*  invest the money and the quality that it took to create a moat. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1241.76s)]
*  And then MySpace really wasn't able to compete. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1247.44s)]
*  So we were, you know, Facebook, we were the eighth or ninth when we showed up on the scene [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1249.1200000000001s)]
*  and we ran circles around everybody. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1252.72s)]
*  I think what it means is that there are these phases of product development which [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1255.3600000000001s)]
*  exist in many markets. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1261.28s)]
*  This market, I think, is going through the same thing. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1262.56s)]
*  And right now we're in the first, what I would call, primordial ooze phase, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1264.96s)]
*  which is everybody's kind of like running around like a chicken with their heads cut off. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1268.88s)]
*  There's all these core basic capabilities that are still so magical when you see them. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1273.2s)]
*  But we all know that five and 10 years from now, these things will be table stakes, right? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1277.3600000000001s)]
*  And what Freeberg just showed is a table of many companies and many trillions of market cap, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1281.3600000000001s)]
*  all effectively running to the same destination. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1289.2s)]
*  So I think where we are is probably within two years of where the basic building blocks are [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1291.84s)]
*  standardized. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1297.92s)]
*  And then I think the real businesses get built. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1299.36s)]
*  So I will maintain my perspective here, which is the quote unquote Facebook of AI has yet to be [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1301.44s)]
*  created. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1307.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1308.8s)]
*  And here it is, chat, GPT web visits, as you can see, have plateaued. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1309.28s)]
*  This data is similar web. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1314.16s)]
*  I would agree with you, Chamath. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1316.56s)]
*  It seems like the use cases and the looky-loos who were just trying the software because they [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1318.08s)]
*  heard about it, they've gone away. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1323.84s)]
*  And then we have to find actual use cases. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1326.16s)]
*  Sax, I'm wondering. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1328.16s)]
*  But our friend, Jason, just to kind of complete that, said something about the premium conversion, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1329.6000000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1333.1200000000001s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1333.52s)]
*  I don't know how he knows that. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1334.16s)]
*  Paid versus free. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1334.96s)]
*  Paid versus free. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1336.0s)]
*  So to be clear, paid versus free. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1337.2s)]
*  And then what Sam said on the podcast last week was it seems like whenever they come out with [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1338.8000000000002s)]
*  something new, the old stuff becomes free. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1343.68s)]
*  In my talk with Sunny this week, he mentioned that these new models are so much more efficient [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1346.24s)]
*  that you actually can throw the old model in the garbage because it's so inefficient. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1352.5600000000002s)]
*  And these are now becoming about 90% cheaper every year, which means every two years these [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1357.6000000000001s)]
*  things are going to be 99% cheaper and better. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1362.72s)]
*  Yep. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1364.96s)]
*  Yep. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1365.68s)]
*  And it might be that OpenAI, Sax, on a strategic level, is going to make all this free or close [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1366.24s)]
*  to free and maybe just charge for multiplayer version. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1374.4s)]
*  That seems to be where it's heading. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1377.1200000000001s)]
*  You don't have to log in to use 3.5. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1379.28s)]
*  You don't have to log in to use Google. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1382.56s)]
*  No, you do have to log in still on Google services, but I think these are going to just [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1385.6s)]
*  be free. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1388.9599999999998s)]
*  So on a product basis, what are your thoughts? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1389.4399999999998s)]
*  And then maybe you could talk about free to pay. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1391.6799999999998s)]
*  Do you think everybody in the world is going to pay 20, 30, 40 bucks, 500 a year, 200 a [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1393.6s)]
*  year to have one of these, or are they just going to all be free? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1398.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, I think you're assuming there that the long-term business model of OpenAI is [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1401.36s)]
*  in B2C subscriptions. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1405.2s)]
*  And I think that's probably the least attractive business model they have available to them. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1406.64s)]
*  It's sort of the first one and the most obvious one because they put out ChatGPT and then [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1412.48s)]
*  it's pretty easy just to roll out a premium version. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1416.96s)]
*  But in my experience, B2C subscriptions, it's just not a very attractive business model [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1419.68s)]
*  because consumers just aren't willing to pay a lot and they have high churn rates and there's [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1424.16s)]
*  no possibility of expansion really. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1428.32s)]
*  So I suspect they're going to move in more of a B2B direction over time because that's [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1430.96s)]
*  where the real money is. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1434.64s)]
*  And probably the way they do that is by monetizing all the apps that are built on top of it. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1436.3200000000002s)]
*  And I think that in that sense, GPT-4.0 is a really important innovation. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1442.88s)]
*  By the way, the O stands for Omni, which I think stands for Omni Channel. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1450.0s)]
*  I think you may have said Omnivore. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1454.72s)]
*  Well, I was making a joke. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1455.92s)]
*  Yes, it's Omni, which means all the different media types currently coming in. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1457.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1462.72s)]
*  Like that's the difference. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1462.88s)]
*  It's not like you just give it an image or give it a video. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1464.08s)]
*  It's absorbing all those at the same time in parallel, I believe. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1466.24s)]
*  That's right. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1469.6799999999998s)]
*  So there's three big innovations with this model, right? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1470.08s)]
*  So one is Omni Channel, which means text, audio, video, and images. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1472.24s)]
*  Second, it's more conversational, like it understands the tone of people talking and [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1476.72s)]
*  understand sort of sentiment in a way it didn't before. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1483.76s)]
*  And then the third thing, which is really important, is that it's just much [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1486.8s)]
*  faster and more performant than the previous version, GPT-4 Turbo. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1490.0s)]
*  In the speed test, they say it's twice as fast. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1493.92s)]
*  We've played with it at GLUE. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1495.8400000000001s)]
*  We can talk about that in a minute. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1497.68s)]
*  And it feels 10 times as fast. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1498.72s)]
*  It is much faster. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1500.3200000000002s)]
*  But it's the combination of all three of these things that really makes some magical [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1501.76s)]
*  experiences possible because when you increase the speed of processing, you can now actually [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1506.16s)]
*  have conversations within a much more natural way. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1512.0800000000002s)]
*  Before, the models were just too slow, so there'd be a long delay after every prompt. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1514.3200000000002s)]
*  So now, like you showed, it can do things like you point the camera at a blackboard [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1521.8400000000001s)]
*  or something with math equations on it, and it can walk you through how to solve that problem. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1526.88s)]
*  Or two people can be talking and it does real-time translation. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1532.16s)]
*  There's that old saying that every Star Trek technology eventually becomes true. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1536.8s)]
*  They've just basically invented the whole natural language, real-time universal translator. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1540.16s)]
*  So those are some interesting use cases. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1546.88s)]
*  But I just think they're going to be able to unleash a whole lot of new applications. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1548.48s)]
*  And if they're metering the usage of the models and providing the best dev tools, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1553.92s)]
*  I think there is a business model there. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1558.88s)]
*  And this thing is moving so fast. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1560.16s)]
*  They're in Leonardo DiCaprio mode. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1562.0s)]
*  Every two years, they throw the old model away. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1563.92s)]
*  OK. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1567.1200000000001s)]
*  Let's keep... [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1567.9399999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Sax. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1568.58s)]
*  Butter Bing. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1569.86s)]
*  Did you write that ahead of time? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1570.5s)]
*  I was just going to say I was hitting the moment. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1573.6999999999998s)]
*  That was good. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1575.54s)]
*  One point on that is there are a whole bunch of startups out there that were creating [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1578.34s)]
*  virtual customer support agents. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1584.8999999999999s)]
*  And they've been spending the last couple of years working on trying to make those [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1587.6999999999998s)]
*  agents more conversational, quicker, more responsive. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1592.1799999999998s)]
*  I think their product roadmaps just became obsolete. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1596.26s)]
*  Now, that's not to say there isn't more work for them to do in workflow in terms of integrating [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1599.1399999999999s)]
*  the AI with customer support tools and doing that last mile of customizing the model for [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1604.5s)]
*  the vertical specific problems of customer support. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1612.02s)]
*  But my guess is that hundreds of millions of dollars of R&D just went out the window. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1615.3s)]
*  And probably this is the best time to be creating a customer support agent company [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1622.1s)]
*  if you're doing it two years ago, five years ago, your work has just been obsolete. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1625.38s)]
*  That is the thing with this pace. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1629.94s)]
*  You used to have to throw away client server stuff or whatever. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1632.18s)]
*  You had a web-based thing. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1635.7800000000002s)]
*  You get an app out. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1637.0600000000002s)]
*  You throw away some of the old code. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1637.7800000000002s)]
*  But this is like every 18 months, your work has been replaced. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1639.22s)]
*  If you're an app developer, the key thing to understand is where does model innovation end [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1642.8200000000002s)]
*  and your innovation begin? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1648.42s)]
*  Because if you get that wrong, you'll end up doing a bunch of stuff that the model will just [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1650.5s)]
*  obsolete in a few months. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1655.06s)]
*  I think you're totally right. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1656.1s)]
*  I think that's such a really important observation. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1657.22s)]
*  That's why I think the incentive for these folks is going to be to push this stuff into [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1659.46s)]
*  the open source. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1663.06s)]
*  Because if you solve a problem that's operationally necessary for your business, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1664.1799999999998s)]
*  but it isn't the core part of your business, what incentive do you have to really keep [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1669.78s)]
*  investing in this for the next five and 10 years to improve it? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1674.98s)]
*  You're much better off like Klarna, for example. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1677.3799999999999s)]
*  We talked about the amazing improvement and savings that Klarna had by [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1679.7s)]
*  improving customer support. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1684.58s)]
*  Release it in the open source, guys. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1686.6599999999999s)]
*  Let the rest of the community take it over so that it's available to everybody else. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1688.34s)]
*  Otherwise, you're going to be stuck supporting it. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1692.1s)]
*  And then if and when you ever wanted to switch out a model, you know, GPT-40, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1694.74s)]
*  4-4-0 to Claude to Llama, it's going to be near impossible and it's going to be costly. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1699.86s)]
*  So I also think, Sachs, the incentive to just push towards open source in this market, if [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1705.78s)]
*  you will, is so much more meaningful than any other market. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1712.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1714.98s)]
*  I mean, listen, you were there when I think you were there at Facebook when they did the [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1715.86s)]
*  open compute project and they just were like, talk about torching an entire market. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1719.78s)]
*  Explain what it is. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1726.26s)]
*  So there was this moment where when you were trying to build data centers, you'd have these [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1727.3s)]
*  like one you rack mounted kind of like machines that you use. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1732.5s)]
*  And what Facebook observed was there was only a handful of companies that provided it. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1736.9s)]
*  And so it was unnecessarily expensive. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1740.66s)]
*  And so Facebook just designed their own and then released the specs online. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1742.8200000000002s)]
*  Just kind of said, here it is. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1747.14s)]
*  And they went to these Taiwanese manufacturers and other folks and said, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1748.66s)]
*  please make these for your cost plus a few bucks. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1752.02s)]
*  And it was revolutionary in that market because it allowed this open platform to sort of embrace [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1755.7s)]
*  this very critical element that everybody needs. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1761.94s)]
*  And I think there's going to be a lot of these examples inside of AI because [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1764.66s)]
*  the costs are so extreme, so much more than just building a data center for a traditional web app [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1770.34s)]
*  that the incentives to do it are just so, so meaningful. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1775.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And I just showed it on the screen. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1779.22s)]
*  Sax, you've actually been dancing along this line. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1780.8999999999999s)]
*  Last night I was using your new Slack killer or code gesture. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1783.06s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1787.3s)]
*  It feels like a Slack killer to me because I'm moving my company to it on over the weekend. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1787.62s)]
*  We're moving to glue and you and I were doing some very, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1791.3s)]
*  I think I may need to wet my beak on this one. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1795.3s)]
*  We want you to wet your beak. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1798.34s)]
*  It feels like a hundred bagger to me. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1799.7s)]
*  Uh, I'm in. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1801.78s)]
*  It is a Slack killer. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1802.74s)]
*  That's the way we're thinking about it. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1804.18s)]
*  Killer-esque. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1805.54s)]
*  J. Cal, can you do that again in Christopher Walken voice, please? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1806.3400000000001s)]
*  I need to wet my beak. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1810.42s)]
*  It feels like a hundred X. Slide in 500. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1812.3400000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1816.02s)]
*  Sax, tell me about product decisions. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1817.8600000000001s)]
*  Where does the AI end? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1821.22s)]
*  And your product begin. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1823.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it's a good point. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1825.78s)]
*  I think where the AI ends, we want to use the most powerful AI models possible. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1827.8600000000001s)]
*  And we want to focus on enterprise chat. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1832.8200000000002s)]
*  So you could think of us as for sure a Slack killer or Slack competitor. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1835.7s)]
*  It says that Slack wasn't built for the AI era. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1839.7s)]
*  Glue is AI native. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1842.74s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1844.42s)]
*  No channels. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1845.3000000000002s)]
*  I showed this to Tumat the first thing he said is you had me at no channels. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1846.42s)]
*  People are so sick of channels. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1850.0200000000002s)]
*  You have to keep up with all these hundreds and hundreds of channels. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1851.14s)]
*  And the real problem with channels is there's one thread in a channel [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1853.3000000000002s)]
*  that you want to see in order to see it. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1856.9s)]
*  You have to join the whole channel. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1858.98s)]
*  And now you're getting all this noise. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1860.18s)]
*  People just want the threads. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1861.7800000000002s)]
*  So if you look at what's the chat model inside of chat GPT, it's just threads. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1863.5400000000002s)]
*  You create a topic based thread in chat GPT. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1867.94s)]
*  The AI comes up with a name for it, puts it in the sidebar. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1871.7800000000002s)]
*  And then if you want to talk about something else, you create a new chat. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1875.7800000000002s)]
*  That's exactly the way that glue works. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1878.18s)]
*  It's just multiplayer. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1879.7s)]
*  You just put the groups and individuals you want on the thread. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1881.38s)]
*  Let me just show you real quick. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1884.26s)]
*  Here's my glue here. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1885.46s)]
*  And you can see that in the sidebar, I've got all the threads that I've been involved in. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1887.38s)]
*  Like I said, you can address them to multiple people or groups. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1890.98s)]
*  And then you've got the chat here. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1894.1000000000001s)]
*  Now, we've also fully integrated AI. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1896.02s)]
*  And so Nick, who's our producer, just in this thread, said, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1898.98s)]
*  at glue AI, what countries does SACS talk about most in episodes? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1902.5s)]
*  Episodes is a group we created to be the repository of all of the transcripts of our episodes. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1906.66s)]
*  And so glue did a search and it said David SACS frequently discusses Ukraine. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1912.42s)]
*  What? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1917.7s)]
*  The most. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1917.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1918.98s)]
*  Really? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1919.62s)]
*  So then Nick said, be more specific about SACS stance on Ukraine-Russia war. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1919.94s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1924.34s)]
*  And it's going to overload the server. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1925.3799999999999s)]
*  Well, it said here, David SACS has articulated a nuance and critical perspective on the [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1928.42s)]
*  Ukraine-Russia war across various episodes of the All In Pod. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1931.94s)]
*  Here are some key points encapsulating his stance. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1934.58s)]
*  And it like nailed it. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1937.3s)]
*  It's talked about prevention through diplomacy, opposition to NATO expansion, humanitarian [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1938.9s)]
*  concerns, skepticism, military intervention, peace deal proposal. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1943.0600000000002s)]
*  I'll copy and paste this onto TwitterX later today. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1947.5400000000002s)]
*  But the point is it nailed it across all these different episodes. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1951.22s)]
*  And then this is a feature of glue. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1955.0600000000002s)]
*  It provided sources. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1957.7s)]
*  So it cites where it got all the information from. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1959.22s)]
*  So imagine we're doing this for the All In Pod, but you could imagine that instead of it being [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1962.26s)]
*  transcripts of a podcast, it could be your work documents. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1968.1s)]
*  You now have in your main chat the ability just to ask, hey, at Glue AI, remind me where we left [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1971.62s)]
*  that project or tell me who the expert is on this subject matter or who's contributed the most to [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1978.4199999999998s)]
*  this project. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1983.46s)]
*  I've actually figured out using Glue AI who's contributed the most deal flow at craft is pretty [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1984.4199999999998s)]
*  amazing. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1989.06s)]
*  Now let me show you like some of the. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1989.78s)]
*  What's the answer? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1991.3799999999999s)]
*  What? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1992.02s)]
*  Yeah, what's the answer? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1992.5s)]
*  Oh, I'm not going to say here. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1993.22s)]
*  I think it's Brian. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1994.98s)]
*  Brian's my guy. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1996.1s)]
*  Those two guys. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1997.46s)]
*  Brian is my guy. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1998.02s)]
*  I want to hire Brian. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=1999.22s)]
*  If I got to go to Saks, I go Daniel and Brian. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2000.34s)]
*  Boom, boom, boom. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2002.6599999999999s)]
*  I want to go. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2003.06s)]
*  That's how I get Saks on the line. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2003.54s)]
*  Okay, you take Daniel. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2004.58s)]
*  I'll hire Brian. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2005.86s)]
*  I would reconstitute craft. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2007.7s)]
*  We'll call it craft. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2009.86s)]
*  All right, look, let me show you a couple. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2014.02s)]
*  Hold on a second. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2015.54s)]
*  Saks, I just looked at the chat GPT-4 Omni server. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2016.82s)]
*  And when you did that query, it actually rolled its eyes. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2020.6599999999999s)]
*  Keep going. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2023.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2024.4199999999998s)]
*  Hey. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2025.46s)]
*  So we talked about how chat GPT-4 Omni understands sentiment in conversations. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2026.34s)]
*  And I think this is a really good example. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2031.54s)]
*  So Evan, who's my co-founder of Glue was just testing this for us. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2033.06s)]
*  And he asked, what is each bestie's personality type based on conversations and episodes? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2037.78s)]
*  And first of all, it figured out who the besties are. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2042.5s)]
*  We didn't program that. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2044.8999999999999s)]
*  It just figured it out on its own, which is pretty impressive. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2045.9399999999998s)]
*  And here's what it said about each bestie's personality. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2049.7s)]
*  So it says Jason Kalkandis role, the moderator and entertainer. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2052.2599999999998s)]
*  Personality traits, charismatic, humorous, lively, and the glue of the group. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2056.02s)]
*  Say more. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2060.34s)]
*  Often praised for his ability to make the podcast entertaining and keep the conversation flowing. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2061.46s)]
*  Jason's energy and ability to bring humor into discussions are key elements that define his [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2066.02s)]
*  role in the podcast. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2068.82s)]
*  Comments he's acknowledged for his role in bringing the group together. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2069.78s)]
*  Chamath Palihapitiya, the visionary and hustler. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2072.26s)]
*  Personality traits, insightful, driven, persistent. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2074.98s)]
*  Chamath's relentless drive and ability to hustle are admired by his peers, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2077.86s)]
*  making him a core part of the podcast and lecture discussions. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2080.98s)]
*  I'll skip me, but does Freeberg, the pragmatic scientist and realist, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2083.14s)]
*  pragmatic, methodical, and a bit reserved? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2087.06s)]
*  Freeberg's often the voice of reason, bringing a scientific and realistic perspective to the [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2089.7799999999997s)]
*  discussion. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2093.14s)]
*  He focuses on analysis, logical reasoning. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2094.1s)]
*  And then it cites where it got this from. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2098.02s)]
*  It says here, overall, the dynamic between the four besties creates a well-rounded [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2099.54s)]
*  and engaging podcast with each member bringing their unique strengths and personality traits [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2102.98s)]
*  to the table. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2106.66s)]
*  I think that's pretty incredible. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2107.46s)]
*  How woke is this? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2108.8199999999997s)]
*  Have you put any rails on or is this just pure chat GPT-4.0 combined with the data? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2109.62s)]
*  So what we're doing here is we're wrapping chat GPT-4.0 with blue features that we've [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2118.5s)]
*  implemented to get the most out of the conversation. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2125.14s)]
*  There's things we have to do to scope the prompt. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2127.54s)]
*  And then we're using a retrieval augmented generation service called Raggy, which does [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2131.38s)]
*  rag as a service that basically slurps in our transcripts and makes them accessible [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2137.3s)]
*  to the AI. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2142.1800000000003s)]
*  So that's basically the stack that we're using. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2143.54s)]
*  But as the models get better and better, glue just gets better and better. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2146.02s)]
*  Again, can I just make a comment on this? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2148.34s)]
*  It's just so clean. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2150.82s)]
*  Jcal was the key for me in abandoning Slack. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2152.34s)]
*  He told me two or three years ago, he called me and he said, I have, you can tell me the [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2156.82s)]
*  exact channels. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2163.7000000000003s)]
*  I eliminated some channels that were random. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2164.34s)]
*  There was like two or three channels that you had banned that your Slack instance wasn't [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2167.86s)]
*  allowed to have. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2171.46s)]
*  And I was like, this is genius. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2172.9s)]
*  And I went in and I was like, all of our companies should just eliminate these channels. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2174.34s)]
*  And we could only get like 20% or 30% compliance. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2177.86s)]
*  But it really started to turn me off Slack because I would get caught in these threads [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2181.86s)]
*  that were just so totally useless. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2185.54s)]
*  And I thought, why aren't people working? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2188.98s)]
*  And this is really great because you cannot blather on about nonsense and glue, which [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2190.82s)]
*  I find really useful. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2195.3s)]
*  Well, this is what happens when Slack. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2196.34s)]
*  We use it at 80, 90, just so you know. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2198.34s)]
*  So we were the, when we got into the early adoptive beta. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2200.1000000000004s)]
*  When you get into Slack too much, people start to think Slack is the job and replying to [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2202.58s)]
*  Slack's in having conversations is the job when there's actually a job to be done. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2206.98s)]
*  There's a job to be done. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2210.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2211.38s)]
*  And so it's important. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2211.7000000000003s)]
*  And what I liked about this implementation facts was it's like the ability to make a feed [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2212.98s)]
*  or a data source inside of your communication platform. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2218.9s)]
*  So the fact that you imported all of the episodes and the transcripts is great. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2222.9s)]
*  But what I want is like our HubSpot or our cell CRM. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2227.3s)]
*  I want our Zendesk. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2231.54s)]
*  I want our LinkedIn jobs and our LinkedIn job applications. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2233.7000000000003s)]
*  I want our notion. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2237.1400000000003s)]
*  I want our coda to each have the ability. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2237.86s)]
*  And when I was using it last night, what you do is you use the at symbol to evoke [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2240.34s)]
*  and to summon in a way it's like summoning a beetle juice. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2246.26s)]
*  So you summon your AI, but then you tell it what data set you want to go after. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2249.14s)]
*  So you say, you know, at AI, let's talk about, I don't know, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2254.74s)]
*  how do you manage your deal flow at craft? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2260.2599999999998s)]
*  Do you use software like CRM software to manage deals? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2262.5s)]
*  Brian, Daniel. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2265.22s)]
*  We just do it all in Glue. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2265.86s)]
*  But we do it all in Glue. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2267.06s)]
*  So it's already right there. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2268.2599999999998s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2269.38s)]
*  So the first thing that Glue AI has access to is all of your chat history, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2269.94s)]
*  which is amazing because you get like, you know, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2274.18s)]
*  that we can look at all your attachments and we've got, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2277.14s)]
*  I think, six integrations at launch. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2280.02s)]
*  There'll be more. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2281.54s)]
*  So yeah, like all of your enterprise data will be there in the short term. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2282.3399999999997s)]
*  You're right. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2285.2999999999997s)]
*  You have to summon the repository by app mentioning because the AI [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2285.62s)]
*  needs a little bit of help of where to look. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2288.74s)]
*  But in the future, it's going to figure it out on its own. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2290.74s)]
*  So it's going to become more and more seamless. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2293.7s)]
*  But it'll insert itself. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2295.46s)]
*  So we have a discussion about sales and then you might have a sales bot that says, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2296.66s)]
*  hey, by the way, nobody's called this client in three months. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2300.5s)]
*  Well, that's where I want to go with it is I call that promptless. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2303.7799999999997s)]
*  Which is I want the AI just to chime in when it determines that it has relevant [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2307.14s)]
*  information and can help the team, even if it hasn't been summoned yet. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2311.22s)]
*  But we need some model improvement for that, frankly. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2315.62s)]
*  I mean, we'll be able to get there by GPT-5, but that's totally where this is headed. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2317.7s)]
*  I'll show you just one more fun example. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2321.54s)]
*  If I could, let me just show you this. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2323.8599999999997s)]
*  So I asked it to write a letter to Lena Con to be a guest at the All-in Summit. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2325.94s)]
*  And I told it, mention positive things we've said about Lena Con in episodes of the All-in Pod. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2332.8199999999997s)]
*  And so it wrote this letter, Dear Chair Con, we hope this message finds you well on behalf [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2340.18s)]
*  of the host of the All-in Pod. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2345.54s)]
*  We are excited to send an invitation for you to speak at the upcoming All-in Summit. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2346.3399999999997s)]
*  And then it says, in our conversations, we have frequently highlighted your impressive [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2350.66s)]
*  credentials and the impactful work you've undertaken. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2354.02s)]
*  For example, in episode 36, we acknowledge your trailblazing role. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2356.74s)]
*  And so the letter was able to quote episodes of the All-in Pod just without anyone having [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2361.62s)]
*  to go do that research and figure out what would be the best. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2367.14s)]
*  Because I told it, only say positive things. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2369.62s)]
*  Don't say anything negative. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2371.7799999999997s)]
*  And then it said warm regards and it said who the four besties were. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2373.94s)]
*  Again, we never told it who the besties are. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2376.42s)]
*  We just said, write us a letter. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2378.66s)]
*  So it's pretty incredible. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2380.98s)]
*  Now, this is an example of the All-in Pod. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2382.98s)]
*  Think about any work context where the AI has access to your previous work documents. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2385.3799999999997s)]
*  It's pretty amazing what it can do. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2390.42s)]
*  Well, I mean, it is kind of in the name. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2393.38s)]
*  Like this is glue, put you together and Slack is where you Slack up. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2394.98s)]
*  Makes total sense. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2398.66s)]
*  The brands give you a little bit of a tip, but we should have seen it coming with Slack. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2400.1s)]
*  Totally. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2404.02s)]
*  We have a breaking news story. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2407.7000000000003s)]
*  It's a breaking news story. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2409.2200000000003s)]
*  It's an All-in exclusive today on the program. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2410.26s)]
*  I got breaking news coming in. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2412.82s)]
*  Friedberg, your life's work. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2414.98s)]
*  Sax did his product review. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2417.8599999999997s)]
*  Now it's your turn, Friedberg. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2420.74s)]
*  We got breaking news coming in. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2421.8599999999997s)]
*  I did promise you that when Ohalo decides to come out of stealth [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2423.2999999999997s)]
*  and explains what we've done and what we're doing, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2428.1s)]
*  I would do it here on the All-in Pod first before the All-in exclusive. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2431.54s)]
*  All-in exclusive. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2436.2599999999998s)]
*  So basically, by the time this pod airs, we're going to be announcing [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2437.9399999999996s)]
*  what Ohalo has been developing for the past five years and has had an incredible breakthrough in, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2442.42s)]
*  which is basically a new technology in agriculture. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2447.2200000000003s)]
*  And we call it boosted breeding. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2451.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm going to take a couple of minutes just to talk through what we discovered or invented [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2452.9s)]
*  at Ohalo and why it's important and the kind of significant implications for it. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2458.26s)]
*  But basically, five years ago, we had this theory that we could change how things are [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2464.02s)]
*  change, how plants reproduce. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2471.46s)]
*  And in doing so, we would be able to allow plants to pass 100% of their genes to their [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2474.02s)]
*  offspring rather than just half their genes to their offspring. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2481.62s)]
*  And if we could do that, then all the genes from the mother and all the genes from the father [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2485.22s)]
*  would combine in the offspring rather than just half the genes from the mother and half the genes [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2489.06s)]
*  from the father. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2493.7s)]
*  And this would radically transform crop yield and improve the health and the size of the plants. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2494.9s)]
*  Which could have a huge impact on agriculture because yield, the size of the plants ultimately [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2501.22s)]
*  drives productivity per acre, revenue for farmers, cost of food, calorie production, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2506.42s)]
*  sustainability, etc. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2511.38s)]
*  So this image just shows generally how reproduction works. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2512.9s)]
*  You've got two parents. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2515.94s)]
*  You get a random selection of half of the DNA from the mother and a random selection of half [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2518.02s)]
*  the DNA from the father. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2523.78s)]
*  So you never know which half you're going to get from the mother or which half you're going [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2524.66s)]
*  to get from the father. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2527.46s)]
*  That's why when people have kids, every kid looks different. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2528.5s)]
*  And then those two halves come together and they form the offspring. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2531.86s)]
*  So every time a new child is born, every time a plant has offspring, you end up with [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2534.66s)]
*  different genetics. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2540.18s)]
*  And this is the problem with plant breeding. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2541.94s)]
*  Let's say that you have a bunch of genes in one plant that are disease resistant, a bunch of [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2543.7s)]
*  genes in the other plant that are drought resistant, and you want to try and get them [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2548.34s)]
*  together. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2551.54s)]
*  Today, the way we do that in agriculture is we spend decades trying to do plant breeding, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2552.5s)]
*  where we try and run all these different crosses, find the ones that have the good genes, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2557.62s)]
*  find the other ones that have the good genes, and try and keep combining them. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2561.38s)]
*  And it can take forever. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2563.94s)]
*  And it may never happen that you can get all the good genes together in one plant to make [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2564.9s)]
*  it both disease resistant and drought resistant. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2569.38s)]
*  So what we did is we came up with this theory that we could actually change the genetics [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2572.8199999999997s)]
*  of the parent plants. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2577.8599999999997s)]
*  We would apply some proteins to the plants and those proteins would switch off the reproductive [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2579.38s)]
*  circuits that cause the plants to split its genes. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2585.54s)]
*  And as a result, the parent plants give 100% of their DNA to their offspring. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2588.98s)]
*  So the offspring have double the DNA of either parent. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2594.82s)]
*  You get all the genes from the mother, all the genes from the father. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2597.94s)]
*  And finally, after years of toiling away and trying to get this thing to work and all these [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2601.3s)]
*  experiments and all these approaches, we finally got it to work. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2606.02s)]
*  And we started collecting data on it. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2609.7s)]
*  And the data is ridiculous. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2611.54s)]
*  Like the yield on some of these plants goes up by 50 to 100% or more. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2613.62s)]
*  Just to give you a sense, like in the corn seed industry, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2618.02s)]
*  breeders that are breeding corn are spending $3 billion a year on breeding. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2622.5s)]
*  And they're getting maybe one and a half percent yield gain per year. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2626.18s)]
*  With our system, we are seeing 50 to 100% jump in the size of these plants. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2629.46s)]
*  It's pretty incredible. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2633.38s)]
*  Here's an example. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2634.1s)]
*  This is a little weed that you do experiments with in agriculture called Arabidopsis. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2635.14s)]
*  So it's really easy to work with. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2640.02s)]
*  And you can see that what we have on the top are those two parents, A and B. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2641.14s)]
*  And then we applied our boosted technology to them and combined them. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2645.22s)]
*  And we ended up with that offspring called Boosted A and B. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2648.9s)]
*  You can see that plant on the right is much bigger. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2650.9s)]
*  It's got bigger leaves. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2652.66s)]
*  It's healthier looking, et cetera. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2653.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2654.74s)]
*  Friar Rokas, can I ask you a question? [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2655.06s)]
*  Does that mean that the boosted one has twice the number of chromosomes as A and B? [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2656.1s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2661.2999999999997s)]
*  So is that like a new species then? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2662.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2665.22s)]
*  So how does it survive with twice the number of chromosomes? [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2665.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2668.9s)]
*  It's called polyploidy. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2669.3799999999997s)]
*  So we actually see this happen from time to time in nature. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2670.5s)]
*  For example, humans have two sets of chromosomes. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2674.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2676.82s)]
*  So does corn. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2677.22s)]
*  So do many other species. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2678.1s)]
*  Somewhere along the evolutionary history, wheat doubled and then doubled again. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2680.5s)]
*  And you end up actually in wheat having six sets of chromosomes. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2686.26s)]
*  Wheat is what's called a hexaploid. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2689.78s)]
*  Potatoes are a tetraploid. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2692.26s)]
*  They have four sets of chromosomes. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2693.54s)]
*  And strawberries are an octaploid. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2695.38s)]
*  They have eight. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2697.06s)]
*  And some plants have as many as 24 sets of chromosomes. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2697.94s)]
*  So certain plant species have this really weird thing that might happen from time to [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2700.7400000000002s)]
*  time in evolution where they double their DNA naturally. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2704.7400000000002s)]
*  And so what we've effectively done is just kind of apply the protein to make it happen [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2708.1s)]
*  and bring the correct two plants together when we make it happen. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2713.06s)]
*  And so- [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2715.94s)]
*  So this could only happen for a plant, right? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2716.7400000000002s)]
*  This could never happen with an animal? [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2718.58s)]
*  It wouldn't work in animals. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2720.18s)]
*  It works in plants. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2721.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2722.66s)]
*  And one way you can think about plant genetics [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2723.06s)]
*  is all the genes are sort of like tools in a toolbox. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2725.7799999999997s)]
*  The more tools you give the plant, the more it has available to it to survive in any given [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2729.22s)]
*  second to deal with drought or hot weather or cold weather, et cetera. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2734.3399999999997s)]
*  And so every given second, the more tools or the more genes the plant has that are beneficial, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2739.2999999999997s)]
*  the more likely it is to keep growing and keep growing. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2743.7799999999997s)]
*  And that plays out over the lifetime of the plant with bigger leaves and grows taller. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2745.7s)]
*  But more importantly, if you look at the bottom, the seeds get bigger. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2751.14s)]
*  And in most crops, what we're harvesting is the seed. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2753.86s)]
*  That's true in corn and many other crops. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2756.42s)]
*  And so seeing over a 40% increase in seed in this little weed was a really big deal. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2759.3s)]
*  But then we did it in potato. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2763.86s)]
*  And potato is a crazy result. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2765.38s)]
*  Potato is the third largest source of calories on earth. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2767.06s)]
*  And so we took two potatoes that you see here in the middle, AB and CD. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2769.94s)]
*  We applied our boosted technology to it, to each of them, and put them together. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2774.34s)]
*  And you end up with this potato, ABCD. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2778.26s)]
*  That's the boosted potato. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2780.1800000000003s)]
*  And as you can see, these were all planted on the same date. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2781.7s)]
*  And the boosted potato is much bigger than all the other potatoes here, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2784.3399999999997s)]
*  including a market variety that we show on the far right. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2788.58s)]
*  That's what's typically grown in the field. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2790.8199999999997s)]
*  Now, here's what's most important. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2792.74s)]
*  When you look under the ground and you harvest the potatoes, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2793.9399999999996s)]
*  you can see that that AB potato only had 33 grams, CD had 9 grams. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2796.66s)]
*  So each parent had 33 and 9 grams potato. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2801.8599999999997s)]
*  But the boosted offspring had 682 grams of potato. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2805.22s)]
*  The yield gain was insane. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2809.06s)]
*  And so you could see this being obviously hugely beneficial for humanity. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2810.98s)]
*  Potatoes being the third largest source of calories. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2816.98s)]
*  Indian potato farmers are growing one acre of potato. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2819.54s)]
*  In India, they eat potato two meals a day. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2822.98s)]
*  In Africa, potato is a food staple. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2826.02s)]
*  So around the world, we've had a really tough time breeding potatoes and improving the yield. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2828.5s)]
*  With our system, we've seen incredible yield gains in potato almost overnight. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2832.42s)]
*  And the other key feature- [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2835.94s)]
*  But how big are those potatoes? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2836.66s)]
*  Those are normal-sized potatoes that you see there. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2838.5s)]
*  Those are like, you know, table potatoes. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2840.34s)]
*  Basically, that looks like a russet potato right there. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2842.7400000000002s)]
*  That's like a normal-sized russet potato. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2844.82s)]
*  It started as like a little creamer potato, basically, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2848.1000000000004s)]
*  and you blew it up into a russet potato. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2850.1800000000003s)]
*  Is that what- [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2852.26s)]
*  Yeah. So the genetics on AB, you can see they're like little purple, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2852.58s)]
*  tiny little purple potatoes. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2857.3s)]
*  The genetics on CD are like these little white, you know, tiny little ball potatoes. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2858.42s)]
*  But when you put those two together with boosted and you combine all the DNA from AB [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2862.6600000000003s)]
*  and all the DNA from CD, you get this crazy high-yielding potato. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2866.5s)]
*  ABCD, which by the way is higher yielding than the market variety [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2870.18s)]
*  that's usually grown in the field on the far right. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2873.54s)]
*  So why not just grow russet potatoes then? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2875.54s)]
*  We are. And so we're working on doing this with russet. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2878.1s)]
*  We're working on doing this with every major potato line. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2880.58s)]
*  Sorry. The improvement you'll see is actually in yield. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2882.8999999999996s)]
*  So it's not the size of the potato. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2886.18s)]
*  It's the number of potatoes that are being made. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2887.46s)]
*  And so you'll see- [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2889.54s)]
*  For a hectare acre or something like that, like the Dwarf Week- [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2890.8199999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2892.66s)]
*  You know, projects in the 60s and 70s. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2893.46s)]
*  Shamaf, you know how you can tell Freeberg's onto something here? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2895.2999999999997s)]
*  He got David Sachs to pay attention during it. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2898.5s)]
*  It's going to be a deca-cord if Sachs is awake. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2902.82s)]
*  Sachs is like, how do I wet my beak? [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2905.06s)]
*  Sachs is interrogating the potato lines. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2906.26s)]
*  I've never- [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2908.82s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2909.7s)]
*  I think Janak is interesting. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2910.66s)]
*  So have you tried these potatoes? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2912.1s)]
*  Do they taste different? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2913.54s)]
*  Oh, no, they're awesome. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2914.74s)]
*  Yeah, they're potatoes. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2915.62s)]
*  And we do a lot of analysis- [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2916.98s)]
*  You haven't sprouted any horns yet or anything like that? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2918.58s)]
*  No. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2920.58s)]
*  I mean, again, one of the other advantages of the system that we've developed, [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2922.82s)]
*  let me go back here, and I just want to take two seconds on this. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2927.2999999999997s)]
*  One of the other things this unlocks is creating actual seed that you can put in the ground [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2929.7s)]
*  in crops that you can't do that in today. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2936.42s)]
*  So potatoes, the third largest source of calories. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2938.2599999999998s)]
*  But the way we grow potatoes, you guys remember the movie The Martian, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2940.98s)]
*  you chop up potatoes and you put them back in the ground. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2943.2999999999997s)]
*  Because the seed that comes out of a potato, which grows on the top in the flour, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2945.7799999999997s)]
*  every one of those seed is genetically different because of what I just showed on this chart. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2950.2599999999998s)]
*  Right? You get half the DNA from the mother, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2954.34s)]
*  half the DNA from the mother. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2955.7s)]
*  So every seed has different genetics. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2956.58s)]
*  So there's no potato seed industry today. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2958.8199999999997s)]
*  And potato is like a hundred billion dollar market. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2960.8999999999996s)]
*  With our system, not only can we make potatoes higher yielding and make them disease resistant, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2964.1s)]
*  what we also make is perfect seed. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2969.22s)]
*  So farmers can now plant seed in the ground, which saves them about 20% of revenue, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2971.7799999999997s)]
*  takes out all the disease risk, and makes things much more affordable and easier to [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2975.8599999999997s)]
*  manage for farmers. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2979.46s)]
*  So it creates entirely new seed industries. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2980.58s)]
*  So we're going to be applying this boosted technology that we've discovered across [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2982.74s)]
*  nearly every major crop worldwide. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2986.66s)]
*  It'll both increase yield, but it will also have a massive impact on [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2989.14s)]
*  the ability to actually deliver seed and help farmers and make food prices lower. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2994.4199999999996s)]
*  Is it more expensive? [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=2998.8999999999996s)]
*  No, it's actually cheaper. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3001.7799999999997s)]
*  So higher yield, lower cost. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3003.14s)]
*  Do you need more water? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3004.74s)]
*  Less water, less land, less energy. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3006.66s)]
*  Do you need more fertilizer? [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3009.06s)]
*  Fertilizer usually scales with biomass, but these sorts of systems should be more efficient. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3012.74s)]
*  So fertilizer use per pound produced should go down significantly as we get to commercial [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3016.8199999999997s)]
*  trials with all this stuff. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3023.3799999999997s)]
*  And we're doing this across many crops. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3024.66s)]
*  So there's a lot of work to do in terms of how do you scale the production in the field. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3026.18s)]
*  And tell us about the patents and how important patents play a role in this, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3030.18s)]
*  because isn't it like one of Monsanto's big things, like they just go and sue everybody [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3036.9799999999996s)]
*  into the ground or whatever? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3040.9799999999996s)]
*  I'm going to answer you one second. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3042.34s)]
*  I'm just going to switch my headset. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3043.46s)]
*  It just died. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3044.82s)]
*  Wow. We went from Saks' bots to Freeberg's crops. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3045.46s)]
*  I'm glad we're doing him second because all of a sudden, like group chat doesn't [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3050.7400000000002s)]
*  seem very important. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3054.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3055.38s)]
*  Wow. He just solved the whole Ukraine crisis here. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3055.86s)]
*  I wouldn't be able to grow wheat in the desert and in the rain forest. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3060.1800000000003s)]
*  He solved the world food problem. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3063.38s)]
*  Yeah, Saks, what did you do for the last six months? [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3065.38s)]
*  Yeah, we made Enterprise Chat a little better, but. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3067.7000000000003s)]
*  We added AI to Enterprise Chat. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3070.5s)]
*  We cleaned up your Slack. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3072.58s)]
*  So yeah, when you invest, we've invested a ton of money. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3073.7799999999997s)]
*  This was dealt for five years. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3076.3399999999997s)]
*  We put a ton of money into this business. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3077.7s)]
*  So when you invest like, um. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3079.94s)]
*  I mean, north of 50. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3083.14s)]
*  North of 50. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3084.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3085.3799999999997s)]
*  50 million five years and you don't have a product in market yet. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3086.02s)]
*  Wow. That's some detail. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3089.2999999999997s)]
*  We actually have some product. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3089.94s)]
*  Yeah. So I haven't talked about the way we've been making money in some of the business [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3090.98s)]
*  we've been doing. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3093.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3094.18s)]
*  Let me just make sure this is like clear. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3094.58s)]
*  So that last photo you showed with the different types of potatoes, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3096.66s)]
*  you had created the super huge ones, but you're saying that the yield benefit here is [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3102.58s)]
*  just you create a much bigger, heartier plant that's capable of producing. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3107.7799999999997s)]
*  Many more potatoes. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3110.8999999999996s)]
*  But the size of the potatoes doesn't change? [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3112.18s)]
*  You can control for that when you breed. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3114.18s)]
*  So the selection of what plants you put together in the Boosted system allows you to decide. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3115.8599999999997s)]
*  Do you want small, medium, large? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3119.7799999999997s)]
*  That's all part of the design of which plants do you want to combine? [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3121.22s)]
*  Okay. Because your goal is not to turn like a russet potato into like a watermelon or [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3124.98s)]
*  something like that. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3128.42s)]
*  No, no. The goal is to make more russet potato per acre so that we use less water, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3128.9s)]
*  we use less land, farmers can make more money, people pay less for food. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3133.22s)]
*  That's the goal. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3137.14s)]
*  And so it's all about yield. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3138.18s)]
*  It's not about changing the characteristics. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3139.46s)]
*  There are some crops where you want to change the characteristics. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3141.62s)]
*  You might want to make bigger corn kernels and bigger cobs on the corn, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3144.1s)]
*  which is another thing that we've done. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3147.86s)]
*  And that's actually been published in our patent. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3149.62s)]
*  And the reason, by the way, I'm talking about all this is some of our patents started to get [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3152.26s)]
*  published last week. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3155.78s)]
*  And so when that came out, the word started to get out. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3157.2200000000003s)]
*  That's why we decided to get public with what we've done, because it's now coming out in the open. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3159.3s)]
*  You mentioned something briefly there about where different crops can be planted. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3163.5400000000004s)]
*  We had these big talks about wheat and corn. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3170.9s)]
*  They're only available in very specific parts, you know, north of the equator, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3173.46s)]
*  the campy jungles, campy, and obviously polar or desert extremes. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3178.0200000000004s)]
*  So if you're successful, what would this do for on a global basis where these crops are made? [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3182.34s)]
*  Because remember, this whole discussion about Ukraine, the wheat belly of Europe, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3190.34s)]
*  the cradle of wheat. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3195.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3196.5800000000004s)]
*  I'm so glad you asked it, because that's one of the key drivers for the business, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3197.94s)]
*  is that we can now make crops adapted to all sorts of new environments that you otherwise [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3201.6200000000003s)]
*  can't grow food. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3206.34s)]
*  Today, there's close to somewhere between 800 million and a billion people that are malnourished. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3207.46s)]
*  That means they are living on less than 1200 calories a day for more than a year. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3211.22s)]
*  But on average, we're producing 3500 calories per person worldwide in our ag systems. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3215.9399999999996s)]
*  The problem is we just can't grow crops where we need them. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3221.54s)]
*  And so by being able to do this sort of system where we can take crops that are very drought [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3224.74s)]
*  resistant, or can grow in sandy soil or very hot weather, and adapt cooler climate crops to those [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3229.2999999999997s)]
*  regions, but through the system, we can actually move significantly where things are grown. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3235.06s)]
*  And an improved food access in regions of how [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3240.26s)]
*  Freebird when you look at a potato, how do you figure out what part of their [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3243.6200000000003s)]
*  DNA is the drought resistant part? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3247.5400000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3250.26s)]
*  And then how do you make sure that that's turned on? [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3251.1400000000003s)]
*  So even if you inherit that chromosome, is there some potential interaction with the [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3252.98s)]
*  Generally, if we can, so these are what are called markers, genetic markers. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3257.46s)]
*  And so there are known markers associated with known phenotypes, a phenotype is a physical [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3261.2200000000003s)]
*  trait of a plant. And so we know lots of markers for every crop that we grow markers for disease [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3266.1s)]
*  resistance, drought resistance, markers for big plants, short plants, etc. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3271.86s)]
*  And so what we do is we look at the genetics of different plants that we might want to combine [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3277.38s)]
*  into the boosted system. And we say these ones have these markers, these ones have these markers, [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3281.62s)]
*  let's put them together. And then that'll drive the results. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3285.46s)]
*  One of the other interesting things we're seeing, which I didn't get too much into in the slides, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3288.8199999999997s)]
*  is it's not just about combining traits. But it turns out, when you add more genes together, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3292.5s)]
*  biology figures out a way to create gene networks. These are all these genes that [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3301.94s)]
*  interact with each other in ways that are not super well understood. But it makes the organism [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3305.86s)]
*  healthier and bigger and live longer. This is like when you bring like why mutts are healthier and [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3311.86s)]
*  live longer than purebred dogs, because they have more genetic diversity. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3316.42s)]
*  So there's a lot of work now in what's called quantitative genomics, where you actually look [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3320.9s)]
*  at the statistics across all the genes, you use a model, and the model predicts which two crosses [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3325.46s)]
*  you want to make out of hundreds of thousands or millions of potential crosses that the AI predicts. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3332.3399999999997s)]
*  Here's the two best ones to cross, because you'll get this growth or this healthiness. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3337.14s)]
*  So how do you want to make money, Freeberg? Are you going to sell the seeds? Are you going to [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3340.98s)]
*  become the direct farmer? Are you going to become food as a service? How do you make the most money? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3345.62s)]
*  We're not going to farm. Farmers are our customers. There are different ways to partner with people in [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3352.02s)]
*  the industry who already have seed businesses or already have genetics and help them improve the [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3358.58s)]
*  quality of their business. Then there's other industries like in potato, where we're building [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3363.8599999999997s)]
*  our own business of making potato seed, for example. So every crop and every region is [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3368.58s)]
*  actually quite different. So it becomes a pretty complicated business to scale. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3373.3s)]
*  We're in the earlier days. We're already revenue generating. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3377.46s)]
*  I would like a sweeter blueberry. No comment. No comment. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3380.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. I get tilted by the quality of the Driscoll's blueberries. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3384.82s)]
*  Let me tell you something about the Driscoll's blueberries. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3388.7400000000002s)]
*  Also, the Driscoll, I've had only one batch of a Driscoll's strawberry that was just off the charts, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3390.9s)]
*  and every 19,847 other batches I bought have been total sh**. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3396.7400000000002s)]
*  Now you want the European small ones or the Japanese ones from Hokkaido, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3401.7s)]
*  because they're rich and sweet and they're not these like monstrosity of giant flavorless [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3406.1s)]
*  strawberries. What's that about, Freebird? Could you do a seedless mango? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3411.46s)]
*  Yes, don't cut it. So you can just cut it. Oh my God, how great would that be? [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3416.02s)]
*  Work for a bite on a mango is like the worst ratio. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3420.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Well, somehow we made it about us. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3424.42s)]
*  Yeah. No, no, look, I think that's it. It's all about you guys. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3427.7s)]
*  Tell us about the blueberries. Sorry. Well, no, every year Driscoll's puts out a special [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3430.26s)]
*  labeled package called sweetest batch. And they just had the sweetest batch of [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3436.1000000000004s)]
*  strawberry and blueberries. I don't know if they're still in the stores, but they only last for like [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3440.6600000000003s)]
*  a week or two. And that's the best genetics only grown on a small number of acres. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3443.86s)]
*  What? Really incredible blueberries. I'm going to go in as soon as this is done. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3447.38s)]
*  See if they have it. So I got it a few weeks ago. It's quite delicious. Anyway, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3451.7000000000003s)]
*  let's just say we know the berry market very well. My co-founder, CTO, Jud Ward, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3455.94s)]
*  whose brilliant idea boosted breeding was many years ago, who I met because they had a New Yorker [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3460.6600000000003s)]
*  article on Judd. I cold called him and said, Hey, will you come in and give us a tech talk? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3466.34s)]
*  We started talking and Judd came up with this idea for boosted breeding. And so we started the [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3470.5800000000004s)]
*  business with Judd and Judd ran molecular breeding at Driscoll. So we have a lot of Driscoll's people [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3474.42s)]
*  that work at Ohalo. We know the market really well. Can you go back to the patent stuff? Like, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3479.2200000000003s)]
*  are you, will some seed person sue you? So we've spent 50 million bucks plus on this business today. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3482.74s)]
*  So we have filed for IP protections that people can't just rip us off. But I would say, I think [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3490.66s)]
*  that the real advantage for the business arises from what we call trade secrets, which is not [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3496.2599999999998s)]
*  just about taking patents and going out and suing people. That's not a great business. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3502.18s)]
*  The business is how do you build a moat? And then how do you extend that moat? The great thing about [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3506.02s)]
*  plant breeding and genetics is that once you make an amazing variety, the next year the variety gets [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3510.82s)]
*  better and the next year the variety gets better. And so it's hard for anyone to catch up. That's [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3515.7000000000003s)]
*  why seed companies generally get monopolies in the markets because farmers will keep buying that [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3519.6200000000003s)]
*  seed every year provided it delivers the best genetics. And so our business model is really [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3525.2200000000003s)]
*  predicated on how do we build advantages and moats and then keep extending them rather than [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3530.1800000000003s)]
*  try to leverage IP. So I'm a big fan of like building business model advantages. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3534.5s)]
*  This is going to be a credible sax. If you think about geopolitically what's going on in Somalia, [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3538.26s)]
*  Sudan, Yemen, Afghanistan, those places have tens of millions of people, I think hundreds of [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3543.46s)]
*  millions collectively who are at risk for starvation. If you could actually make crops that could be [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3549.6200000000003s)]
*  farmed there, Friedberg, you would change humanity. And then all these people buying [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3554.1000000000004s)]
*  up farmland in America, that could devalue that farmland if that wasn't as limited of a resource. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3558.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, Friedberg? [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3564.9s)]
*  No, I think so first of all, like farmland in America is mostly family owned. It's got [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3565.46s)]
*  60% rented actually. So a lot of families own it and then they rent it out because they stop farming [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3570.82s)]
*  it. But the great thing that we've seen in agriculture historically is that the more [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3575.6200000000003s)]
*  calories we produce, the more food we produce, the more there seems to be a market. It's like [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3582.6600000000003s)]
*  any other economic system. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3586.34s)]
*  What about wheat and rice? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3587.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so those are calorie sources one and two. And there's certainly opportunity for us to apply [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3589.9399999999996s)]
*  our boosted systems there. The big breakthrough with potatoes, we can make potato seed using [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3595.8599999999997s)]
*  our boosted system in addition to making better potatoes. McDonald's is the largest buyer of [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3600.8199999999997s)]
*  potatoes. Yeah. So in the US, 60% of the potatoes go to French fries and potato chips. McDonald's [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3605.14s)]
*  buys most of the fries. PepsiCo under Frito-Lay buys most of the potato chip potatoes. 40% are [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3610.8999999999996s)]
*  table potatoes. In India, 95% of the potatoes are table potatoes. They're eaten at home. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3616.18s)]
*  And the Indian potato market's three to four times as big as the US potato market. In Brazil, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3623.2999999999997s)]
*  it's 90% table potato. So all around the world, potatoes are different. The US is [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3627.8599999999997s)]
*  unusually large consumers of French fries and potato chips. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3633.2999999999997s)]
*  I speak on behalf of J. Calhoun. I said, we will gladly invest a million at a 10 cap in both of [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3636.66s)]

*  and J. Calhoun have secured the bag. So breaking news. Jamath and J. Calhoun have secured the bag [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3658.82s)]
*  from the besties actually doing work. Yeah. Well, I appreciate you guys letting me talk about it. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3664.1s)]
*  Congratulations. I'm excited to share it. I'm excited to be with the both of you. I love it. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3668.66s)]
*  It's been a, yeah. Building stuff is hard. There's always risk. It's a lot of work and [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3671.7s)]
*  a lot of setbacks, but man, when you get stuff working, it's great. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3677.14s)]
*  It's so great. We're each doing the things we do best. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3680.98s)]

*  We need your enterprise chat a little better. All progress counts. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3691.06s)]
*  All right. Stanley Druckenmiller has got a new boyfriend. Druckenmiller's got a boyfriend [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3693.94s)]
*  and his name is Javier and they've eloped to Argentina. Druckenmiller professed his love. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3702.42s)]

*  If he came to office, they've gone from a primary deficit of like four or five percent to a 3% [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3720.9s)]
*  surplus. They've taken a massive hit in GDP, basically a depression for a quarter and his [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3725.7000000000003s)]
*  approval rating has not gone down. Druckenmiller has explained how he invested in Argentina after [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3730.6600000000003s)]
*  seeing Malay's speech at Davos, which we covered. Here's a 30 second clip, play the clip, Nick. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3737.62s)]
*  By the way, do you want to hear how I invest in Argentina? It's a funny story. I wasn't at Davos, [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3743.86s)]
*  but I saw the speech in Davos and it was about one o'clock in the afternoon in my office. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3749.3s)]
*  I dialed up perplexity and I said, give me the five most liquid ADRs in Argentina. It gave me [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3754.26s)]
*  enough of a description that I followed the old Soros rule, invest and then investigate. I bought [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3761.54s)]
*  all of them. We did some work on them. I increased my positions. So far it's been great, but we'll [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3767.7000000000003s)]
*  see. Yeah, that's quite interesting. He quick note, you hear Druckenmiller mentioned ADRs. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3773.3s)]
*  For those of you who don't know, and I was one of them, they stand for American Depository Receipts, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3779.6200000000003s)]
*  basically a global stock offered on a US exchange to simplify things for investors. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3784.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he didn't sign a prenup here. He just went all in and he bought the stock, Chamath, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3791.0600000000004s)]
*  and then he's going to figure it out later. Tell us your thoughts on this love affair, this bromance. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3796.1800000000003s)]
*  There's a great clip of Millet. He goes on this talk show in Argentina and the talk show host, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3801.94s)]
*  she's just so excited and greets him and then they start making out. Have you guys seen this? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3807.38s)]
*  What? They're just guys out of control. Full on French kissing each other. It's hilarious. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3813.86s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, like Soros has been very famous for this invest and investigate thing. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3820.82s)]
*  It's like a smart strategy for very, very liquid public market investors that have the curiosity [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3825.7s)]
*  that he does. I mean, I don't have much of a reaction to that. I think that the thing with [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3832.9799999999996s)]
*  Argentina that's worth taking away is when you've spent decades casting about and misallocating [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3836.9799999999996s)]
*  capital and running your economy into the ground, the formula for fixing it is exactly the same. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3844.66s)]
*  You cut entitlements and you reinvigorate the economy. And so, the thing we need to take away [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3851.7000000000003s)]
*  is if we don't get our shit together, that's probably what we're going to have to do. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3858.26s)]
*  Sax, the influence of Millet on American politics. Will there be any? It seems like he has paralleled [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3860.82s)]
*  what Elon did at Twitter, Facebook, and Zuck did at Facebook. Do you think that this experiment [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3869.2200000000003s)]
*  he's doing down there of just cutting staff, cutting departments will ever make its way [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3877.54s)]
*  into American politics? Probably not. I mean, not until we're forced to. But what Millet did, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3882.5s)]
*  he comes in and they've got a huge budget deficit and they've got runaway inflation and they're [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3889.78s)]
*  debasing their currency and just practically overnight, he just slashes government spending [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3894.1s)]
*  to the point where he has a government surplus. And then as soon as he gets credibility with the [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3898.98s)]
*  markets, that allows them to reduce interest rates, inflation goes away, and people start [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3903.46s)]
*  investing in the country. Magic. It's magic. So there is a path. It's obvious. Listen, I mean, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3908.6600000000003s)]
*  you can't run deficits forever. You can't accumulate debt forever. It's just like a household. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3914.98s)]
*  If your spending exceeds your income, eventually you got to pay it back or you go broke. And the [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3922.1800000000003s)]
*  only reason we haven't gone broke or experienced hyperinflation is because we're the world's [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3928.9s)]
*  reserve currency. So there's just a lot of room for debasement. And there's not already alternative [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3932.5s)]
*  yet. I mean, everyone's trying to figure out what the alternative will be. So we've been able to [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3938.58s)]
*  accumulate more and more debt, but it's reaching a point where it's unsustainable. And what we've [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3942.34s)]
*  already seen is that the feds have to jack up interest rates from very low, practically nothing [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3946.34s)]
*  to five and a half percent. And that has a real cost on people's wellbeing because now your cost [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3952.02s)]
*  of getting a mortgage goes way up. I mean, mortgage rates are over what? Seven and a half percent now. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3959.3s)]
*  Yeah. Six, seven percent, depending on how much net worth and your credit rating. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3963.78s)]
*  Right. And so it's much harder to get a mortgage now. It's harder to make a car payment if you need [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3968.5800000000004s)]
*  to borrow to buy a car. And if you have personal debt, the interest rates can be higher. The [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3973.54s)]
*  inflation rate actually doesn't take into account any of those things. Remember Larry Summers did [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3978.1800000000003s)]
*  that study where he said the real inflation rate would be 18% or would have peaked at 18%. If you [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3982.34s)]
*  include a cost of borrowing, that's why people don't feel as well off as the unemployment rate [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3988.34s)]
*  would normally suggest. So people are hit really hard when interest rates go up in terms of big [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=3993.7000000000003s)]
*  purchases they need to make with debt. And then of course, it's really bad for the investment [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4001.7000000000003s)]
*  environment because when interest rates are really high, that creates a higher hurdle rate and people [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4005.86s)]
*  don't want to invest in risk assets. And so eventually the pace of innovation will go down. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4012.9s)]
*  And Druckenmiller made this point in his next set of comments. He said that treasury is still acting [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4018.5s)]
*  like we're in a depression. It's interesting because I've studied the depression. You had a [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4023.86s)]
*  private sector crippled with debt basically with no new ideas. So interventionist policies were [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4027.86s)]
*  called for and were effective. He said the private sector could not be more different today than it [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4033.2200000000003s)]
*  was in the Great Depression. The balance sheets are fine. They're healthy. And have you ever seen [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4038.34s)]
*  more innovation ideas that the private sector could take advantage of like blockchain, like AI? [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4042.18s)]
*  He says all the government needs to do is get out of the way and let them innovate. Instead, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4047.54s)]
*  they spend and spend and spend. And my new fear now is that spending and the resulting [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4050.58s)]
*  interest rates on the debt that's been created are going to crowd out some of the innovation [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4056.02s)]
*  that otherwise would have taken place. I completely endorse Druckenmiller's view of binomics. And [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4061.22s)]
*  actually, I mean, this is what I said way back in 2021. Victory lap. Here we go. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4065.22s)]
*  David Sacks victory lap. We need a little graphic for that. Druckenmiller used the word binomics. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4072.66s)]
*  Instead, I give these guys an F because they're still printing money and spending money like [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4076.8999999999996s)]
*  we're in a depression, even though we're in a rip-roaring economy. And when they started [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4081.2999999999997s)]
*  doing this back in 2021, I tweeted binomics equals pumping trillions of dollars of stimulus into a [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4085.2999999999997s)]
*  rip-roaring economy. I'm not going to pretend like I know what's going to happen next, but [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4090.66s)]
*  never tried this before. What happened next was a lot of inflation and that jacked up interest rates. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4093.54s)]
*  According to even Keynesian economics, the reason why you have deficit spending is because you're [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4098.02s)]
*  in a recession or depression. And so use the government to stimulate and balance things out. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4103.3s)]
*  You don't do deficit spending when the economy is already doing well. So this spending, there's no [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4107.9400000000005s)]
*  reason for it. It's like showing up to like a party that's going crazy and being like, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4113.700000000001s)]
*  putting gasoline on the fire. Yeah. I mean, more importantly, it should limit the approval or [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4118.5s)]
*  action of certain programs that you might otherwise want to do in a normal environment, [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4124.66s)]
*  but in an inflationary environment, you don't have the flexibility to do them. Student loan [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4130.58s)]
*  forgiveness is a really good example. Is now the time? Of course not. To do student loan [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4136.5s)]
*  forgiveness or do we wait for inflation to temper a bit? Is now the time? So there's just a lot of [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4141.139999999999s)]
*  these examples that actually the opposite should be true. Yeah, but none of all of those things get [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4146.98s)]
*  you votes. Before we move on from this, look, what we have coming out of Washington here is a [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4152.02s)]
*  contradictory and therefore self-defeating policy. You've got the Fed jacking up rates [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4155.9400000000005s)]
*  to control inflation. You move across town and you've got Capitol Hill on the White House [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4160.42s)]
*  spending like there's no tomorrow, which is inflationary. Right. Why would you do both [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4165.3s)]
*  those things? Choose what your policy is going to be. It's like driving with your foot on the brake [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4168.740000000001s)]
*  and the gas at the same time. It's not a great idea for the car. Let me just make one comment, [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4172.580000000001s)]
*  J. Cal, before we move on about the Druckenmiller investment statement. Of course. I just wanted [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4176.34s)]
*  to say I think what it highlights about Druckenmiller and call it a rift in investing philosophy or skill [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4180.66s)]
*  is the difference between precision and accuracy. What I mean by that is precision really references [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4187.94s)]
*  that you do a lot of detailed analysis to try and make sure you understand every specific thing that [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4194.18s)]
*  is going right or could go wrong. But the problem, and so that means you, for example, might do a ton [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4200.18s)]
*  of diligence on a company and make sure you understand every dollar, every point of margin, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4205.3s)]
*  all the specifics of the maturation of that business and where they are in their cycle. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4209.54s)]
*  But you could be very precise, but be very inaccurate, for example, if you miss an entire [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4214.34s)]
*  trend. Someone could invest in Macy's back when Amazon was taking off and have done a lot of [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4219.86s)]
*  precise analysis on Macy's margin structure and performance and said this is a great business. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4225.78s)]
*  But they missed the bigger trend, which is that e-commerce was going to sweep away Macy's. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4230.9s)]
*  Consumers were simply that's not possible in the analysis that they were doing. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4235.7s)]
*  Let's be honest, Freeberg. Nobody could make that stupid of a trade to say Macy's versus [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4240.0199999999995s)]
*  Amazon over the next 10 years. Do you want to show that? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4244.5s)]
*  Do not poke the tiger. Let's not get into it with other broadcasters. The worst spread trade in [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4251.46s)]
*  history. Let me just finish the statement. But the other one is being accurate. Accurate means you get [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4256.58s)]
*  the right bet, the right sentiment, the right friend. The problem with being accurate, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4262.66s)]
*  you could have said in the year 2000, hey, the internet is going to take off. And you could have [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4267.46s)]
*  put a bunch of money in. But the problem was you were right. You just had to have the necessary [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4272.98s)]
*  patience. And so accuracy generally yields better returns, but it requires more patience because you [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4278.179999999999s)]
*  can't necessarily time how long it will take for you to be right. So a guy like Druckenmiller is [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4285.78s)]
*  making an accurate bet. He bets correctly on the trend on where things are headed. He doesn't [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4291.22s)]
*  necessarily need to be precise, but he has the capital and his capital structure that allows him [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4296.900000000001s)]
*  to be patient to make sure that he eventually gets the return. And to build on your thoughts, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4301.780000000001s)]
*  having watched this movie a couple of times and you know, I overthought the Twitter investment [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4305.22s)]
*  as but one example, I had the opportunity to invest in Twitter when it was like a single digit [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4309.7s)]
*  millions company. And I just thought, you know what, this thing is only like the headline. And [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4314.740000000001s)]
*  I told that like it's the headline. It's not like the entire blog post, it'd be a cacophony of idiots. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4320.02s)]
*  This thing is going to be chaos. And I was right, but I was wrong. Right. Great bet, but my wrong [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4324.9800000000005s)]
*  analysis. And so you can add precision to other aspects, like when you sell your shares or when [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4329.9400000000005s)]
*  you double down, but you have to get the trend right, which is Evan Williams, great entrepreneur, [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4336.26s)]
*  Jack, great entrepreneur, Twitter taking off like a weed, just make the bet. Right. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4340.34s)]
*  And the problem is you knew too much about journalism. You knew too much about the space [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4344.42s)]
*  they were trying to disrupt. And that can be a mistake. Correct. We did PayPal, none of us knew [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4349.38s)]
*  anything about payments. That was one of the reasons we were successful. All the payments [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4354.1s)]
*  experts told us it couldn't be done. Right. So that happens a lot. I had never even know, [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4357.06s)]
*  I didn't even know what a Facebook was when I joined Facebook. It's an American college [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4362.34s)]
*  phenomenon. No, serious? You don't have that in Canada. But you knew Zach and you saw some [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4365.86s)]
*  growth charts and you saw some precision in his ability to build product. And that's the way to [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4370.5s)]
*  go. The great thing about network effect businesses is there's a trend line that sustains [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4375.46s)]
*  because it builds if it's an appropriate network effect. So you can be accurate about buying into [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4380.74s)]
*  the right network effect business. You don't need to use all of this diligence to be perfectly sound [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4385.78s)]
*  around the maturation of the revenue and the margin structure and all that stuff, [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4392.82s)]
*  as long as the trend line is right. And you're willing to be patient to hold your investment. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4396.74s)]
*  I think Druckenmiller's point is incredible. He took a look, he very quickly made a macro assessment [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4400.18s)]
*  from a macro perspective. What Millay is doing is significantly different than what we're seeing in [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4405.38s)]
*  any other emerging market, let alone mature market with respect to fiscal austerity and appropriateness [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4410.18s)]
*  in this sort of inflationary global inflationary environment. And he said, you know what, I don't [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4415.86s)]
*  see any other leader doing this. This is a no brainer bet. Let me make the bet. And as long as [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4419.86s)]
*  he's willing to hold this thing for long enough, eventually the markets will get there and call it [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4424.900000000001s)]
*  a spread trade against anything, he'll be proven right. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4429.54s)]
*  But speaking of bets, Jayco you told me this week that you just made your largest investment ever. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4434.5s)]
*  Tell us about that. Yeah. So I've gotten very lucky now because a lot of my founders from the first [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4439.3s)]
*  couple of cohorts of investing I did when I was a Sequoia Scout have come back and created second [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4444.66s)]
*  and third companies. And so that happened with TK Uber and the Cloud Kitchens. It happened with [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4450.5s)]
*  Raoul from Reportive then Superhuman. And then it happened recently just in the past year, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4456.34s)]
*  my friend Jonathan, who's the co-founder of Thumbtack, asked me to come to dinner and said, [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4462.58s)]
*  hey, you know, you were the first investor in Thumbtack. Will you be the first investor in [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4466.58s)]
*  our next company, Athena? And I said, sure. What do you do? And he explained it to me. And we put [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4470.02s)]
*  a seven figure bet in, which is rare for us as a seed fund, right? Normally our bet sizes are 100k, [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4473.78s)]
*  250, you know, it's a $50 million fund. Why did you do it? Yeah, it's very simple. It's the fastest [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4478.900000000001s)]
*  growing company I've ever seen. And I'm including Uber in that. It has been growing at, you know, [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4484.26s)]
*  a rate that I'll just say is faster than Uber and Robinhood when we were investing in them, [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4492.5s)]
*  tens of millions of dollars. It's a very simple concept. When Thumbtack was building their [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4496.820000000001s)]
*  marketplace, they used researchers in places like Manila, et cetera, in the Philippines, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4502.74s)]
*  knowledge workers. And what they realized was the 0.1% of those knowledge workers were as good or [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4509.06s)]
*  better than say Americans at doing certain jobs. And so they've created this virtual EA service. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4515.14s)]
*  You can go see it at AthenaWow.com. And we now have two of them inside of our company. It turns [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4521.46s)]
*  out Americans don't want to do the operations role. So it's kind of like AWS. You just give them [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4528.18s)]
*  $36,000 a year. They give you essentially an operations or an EA. And they have ones that [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4532.820000000001s)]
*  are kind of chief of staff-ish. And this company is growing like a weed. So I am working with them [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4538.26s)]
*  on the product design as well. So imagine having, you know, two or three of these incredibly hard [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4545.46s)]
*  working people who are trained with MBA class level curriculum. They spend months training [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4551.9400000000005s)]
*  these people up. They pay them two or three times what they would make at any other company. And [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4560.18s)]
*  then they pair them with executives here. And it's kind of been an underground secret in Silicon [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4564.74s)]
*  Valley because it's only by invitation right now, because they can only train so many people. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4569.78s)]
*  But if you've tried to hire an executive assistant, I don't know if anybody's tried to do that recently. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4574.58s)]
*  You hooked me up. So I will be guinea picking this service. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4578.98s)]
*  Soon. And I have two of them. And so it is just the greatest that you can have an operations. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4582.9s)]
*  Are these people powered by AI tools as well? Yeah. So that's the kind of secret sauce here is [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4588.26s)]
*  they're training them and they watch you work and then they will learn how you do your job. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4593.86s)]
*  And then how quickly you can delegate and get stuff off your plate is the name of the game. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4599.219999999999s)]
*  So we have an investment team with researchers and analysts in it. We have a due diligence team. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4603.38s)]
*  And then you have like executive functions in our fund. They have now started shadowing, [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4607.78s)]
*  you know, you know, highly paid Americans in an investment firm, ours, and then train them up. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4613.78s)]
*  And now our due diligence, our first level screening, you know, and our tracking of [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4619.86s)]
*  companies is being done by these assistants for what I'll say is a third to a fourth of the price [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4624.58s)]
*  I was paying previously. So what that does in an organization is we're just delegating away and [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4629.94s)]
*  then moving our investment team to doing in-person meetings and doing higher level stuff. And so [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4635.0599999999995s)]
*  you're 80, 90. So at 80, 90, we have this funny thing where we've made a derrb. Whenever you see [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4640.9s)]
*  somebody doing high quality work at a quarter to a 10th of the cost, we say, Oh, you just 80, 90'd [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4646.82s)]
*  it. So you're 80, 90 in the investment team. I'm 80, 90 in the investment team. And you know what? [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4652.98s)]
*  It was scary as hell for them. Cause they're like, am I going to lose my job? It's like, no, [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4657.94s)]
*  you now get to, instead of doing a check and call once a month, you can do a check and call every [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4661.139999999999s)]
*  other week or every week, or instead of doing 15 first round interviews a week, you can do 25, [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4665.7s)]
*  because you have this assistant with you doing all the repetitive work. The way that companies [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4671.62s)]
*  will work in five and 10 years. I don't think guys, any of us are going to recognize what it's [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4676.5s)]
*  going to look like. This is where I go. I mean, like watching Sachs' demo earlier, how much [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4680.74s)]
*  progress and how seamless that product works with the features it has enabled by the underlying [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4686.42s)]
*  models. You just get to thinking how all of these vertical software applications become [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4692.58s)]
*  completely personalized and quickly rebuilt around AI. It's so obvious. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4700.34s)]
*  Can you imagine how long it would have taken John to write a letter to Lena Conn to invite, [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4706.58s)]
*  like if we said, John, invite Lena Conn, but be sure to reference all the nice things we said about [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4710.58s)]
*  her on episodes of the pod. It'd be 10 hours of work. You got to go find the episodes, listen to [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4714.66s)]
*  them, and figure out what the best quotes are. And you got it done in five seconds. It's incredible. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4720.26s)]
*  Imagine building that same sort of capability into a very specific vertical application that's [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4725.38s)]
*  specific to some business function. And you can probably spend a couple of minutes or an hour [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4730.18s)]
*  building that function. And then it saves you hours a day in perpetuity. I think that's why [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4735.46s)]
*  these tools companies or the tools products that Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and a few others are [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4741.78s)]
*  building are actually incredible businesses because so many enterprises and so many vertical [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4749.7s)]
*  application builders are going to be able to leverage them. I got their entire business [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4755.139999999999s)]
*  functions. I got myself and my co-founders at 80 90. We get this stream of emails of companies [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4759.139999999999s)]
*  that are like, or people that are like, we have this product idea, or we have this small product. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4764.34s)]
*  One of the emails I got, this is crazy, was from a guy that's like, oh, we've 80 90 Photoshop. So [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4770.9s)]
*  we have a much, much cheaper version of Photoshop. And the guy was doing a few million bucks of [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4776.82s)]
*  ARR and growing really nicely. But then it turned out that somebody saw that and then 80 90'd it. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4781.38s)]
*  And so to your point, Fieberg, none of these big companies stand a chance. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4790.98s)]
*  Not because the products aren't good, but like, J-Cal's going to go off and experiment with this. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4798.9s)]
*  SAC's going to go off and build a product. You know, as every time that you're at a boundary [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4804.18s)]
*  condition, we're all going to explore, well, maybe we could do this with AI. Maybe we shouldn't hire [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4808.02s)]
*  a person, not because we're trying to be mean about it, but it's because the normal, natural [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4813.3s)]
*  thing to do. And the apex of companies is just going to go down, which means the size of companies [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4818.5s)]
*  are going to shrink, which means the amount of money you need is going to go down. And that's [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4823.700000000001s)]
*  just going to create the ability for these companies to sell those products cheaper. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4827.9400000000005s)]
*  So it's a massive deflationary tale. We had the same thing happen with compute and now it's [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4832.02s)]
*  happening inside of organizations. I wrote a blog post about this on my sub-stack called ADD. This [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4838.1s)]
*  is the framework I came up with. I told my entire team, look at what you got done every week. And I [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4843.06s)]
*  want you to ask three questions. How can I automate this? How can I deprecate this? How can I delegate [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4848.02s)]
*  it? And the automate part is AI and what you're doing, David. The delegate part is AthenaWow.com. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4853.860000000001s)]
*  And then the deprecate is, Hey, just be thoughtful. What are you doing that you don't need to do? [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4860.18s)]
*  And that's 80 90 and something like there are things inside these products that you don't [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4864.9800000000005s)]
*  actually need. What's the core functionality of the product? You know, make it as affordable as [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4869.06s)]
*  possible. And then what's going to happen for people who think this is bad for society, you've [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4874.1s)]
*  got it completely wrong. We're going to have more people be able to create more products and solve [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4878.26s)]
*  more problems. The unemployment rate is going to stay very low. We're just going to have more [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4883.54s)]
*  companies. So the idea like there was somebody who was working on very small like software, [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4888.58s)]
*  I want to get pitched on very niche ideas. I want to create something where people can find people [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4894.26s)]
*  to play pickleball with, right? Like a pickleball marketplace. Now that didn't wouldn't typically [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4898.82s)]
*  work because you would need $5 million a year to build that product. But if you can build it for [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4903.7s)]
*  $500,000 a year, well, now you've only got to clear that number to be profitable. So a lot more [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4907.94s)]
*  smaller businesses, a lot more independence, all these little niche ideas will be able to be built. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4912.9s)]
*  And a VC who says I'm not giving you $5 million to build that app will be like, but I will give you [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4918.179999999999s)]
*  500k. And that's what I'm seeing on the ground in startups, the same startups that had a request of [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4922.099999999999s)]
*  $3 million in funding five years ago are now requesting 500 to a million. It's deflationary [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4928.179999999999s)]
*  all the way down. Did you guys see the Google thing? Did you guys see the Google Gemini stuff? [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4935.62s)]
*  Chat GPT Omni launch at the same time, or perhaps strategically right before Google dropped its [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4941.46s)]
*  latest AI announcements at IO. The biggest announcement is that they are going to change [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4948.74s)]
*  search. This is the piece of the puzzle in the kingdom that they have been very concerned with [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4955.38s)]
*  and they're going for it. The new product, and they have like 20 different products. You can see [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4960.18s)]
*  them at labs.google where they put all their different products, but this is the most important [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4965.3s)]
*  one they call it AI overviews. Basically, it's perplexity for most users by the end of the year, [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4969.22s)]
*  they're going to have this. Here's how it works. And you can see it on your screen. If you're [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4974.34s)]
*  watching us go to YouTube. Here, they gave an example. How do you clean a fabric sofa? This [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4977.46s)]
*  normally would have given you 10 blue links here, it gives you step by step guide with citations and [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4982.34s)]
*  links. So they're preempting the you know, the issue of people getting upset. And as I predicted, [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4987.46s)]
*  they're going to have targeted ads. Here's the things you need in order to clean your couch. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4993.94s)]
*  You can only use this if you're using your Gmail account. If you use like a domain name [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=4999.7s)]
*  on Google Docs, it won't work there. So go to labs.google. But they're doing citations. And [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5003.94s)]
*  I think that we're going to see a major lawsuit here. Those people who are in those boxes are [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5010.099999999999s)]
*  going to look at the answer here and realize maybe they don't get the click through. And that this [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5014.9s)]
*  answer was built on that. And now we're going to have to have a new framework, there's going to [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5018.419999999999s)]
*  need to be sacks a new company that clears this content so that Google can do answers like this. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5021.54s)]
*  The workflow stuff in Gmail also kicked ass the demo that they showed was you get a bunch of [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5028.66s)]
*  receipts. And the person giving the demo she said something the effective well, wouldn't it be great [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5034.42s)]
*  if like, you know, the AI assistant were able to find all the receipts, and then aggregated them, [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5040.0199999999995s)]
*  and it puts them in a folder, and then also actually generated an expense report or like a [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5044.98s)]
*  spreadsheet on the fly. It it's crazy. Yeah, I gotta say, I think that it's free to change your [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5050.42s)]
*  mind. And so it's good to do that. Oh, and I think that Jamath, in a rare moment of reflection, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5056.5s)]
*  might do a we can have a re underwriting. I change my mind all the time. I just I mean, [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5064.26s)]
*  you know, because I'm [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5070.42s)]
*  gentlemen, breaking news. Jamath is re underwriting his Google train. Sorry, I know to blow your ears [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5071.22s)]
*  out. I think the Google thing is pretty special between last week's announcement of isomorphic [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5078.1s)]
*  labs, which let's be honest, that's a that's just a multi hundred billion dollar company. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5084.18s)]
*  So you're saying there might be many think about it this way, right? [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5090.42s)]
*  Multi billion dollar opportunity sitting there dormant inside a Google that AI unlocks. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5093.700000000001s)]
*  Look at a company like royalty pharma. So royalty pharma with a pretty it's a phenomenal business [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5097.620000000001s)]
*  run by a phenomenal entrepreneur Pablo Lagareta. But what is that business that's buying two and [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5103.3s)]
*  3% royalties of drugs at work? And you can see how much value that those guys have created, [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5107.54s)]
*  which is essentially 90% EBITDA margin business, it's outrageous, because they're in the business [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5113.94s)]
*  of analyzing, and then buying small slivers. I think something like isomorphic ends up being [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5119.62s)]
*  of that magnitude of margin scale, but at an order of magnitude or two orders of magnitude higher [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5125.38s)]
*  revenue. So if you if you fold that back into a Google, if you think about what they're doing now [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5130.34s)]
*  on the search side, these guys may be really kicking some ass here. So I think that the [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5137.14s)]
*  the reports of their death were premature and exaggerated. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5143.780000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. And the report of their death freeburg was based upon people don't need to click on the [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5146.900000000001s)]
*  ads. But as I said on this very bogus, my belief is that this is going to result in more searches [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5150.9800000000005s)]
*  and more knowledge engagement. Because once you get how to cook your steak and get the [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5158.18s)]
*  right temperature right for medium rare, it's going to anticipate your next three questions [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5163.62s)]
*  better. So now to say, Hey, what wine pairing would you want with that steak? Hey, do you need [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5168.42s)]
*  steak knives? And it's just going to read your mind that you need steak knives and charmoth likes [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5172.34s)]
*  to buy steak knives, but maybe you like to buy mock meats, whatever it is, it's going to drive [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5176.18s)]
*  more research and more clicks. So while the monetization per search may go down, we might [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5181.38s)]
*  see many, many more searches. What do you think freeburg you work there? And when we look at the [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5186.1s)]
*  the future of the company and the stock price, Nick, we'll pull it up. Man, if you had held your [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5192.820000000001s)]
*  stock, did you hold? I bought some during the original stock during the WCAI stuff. Oh, no, [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5198.58s)]
*  I sold all my stock back when I started climate because I was a startup entrepreneur and needed [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5206.740000000001s)]
*  to live. So which, you know, I recently did, I did the math on it. It was pretty, it'd be worth, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5211.9400000000005s)]
*  it'd be worth a lot. It would be worth billions or tens of billions? No, no. Would it have been a [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5220.18s)]
*  billion or? No, no. Okay. You know, I was not like a super, I was not a senior exec or anything. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5226.02s)]
*  I think what you said is, is probably true. So that's a creative. I think the other thing [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5231.62s)]
*  that's probably true is a big measure at Google on the search page in terms of search engine [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5237.46s)]
*  performance was the bounce back rate, meaning someone does a search, they go off to another [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5243.94s)]
*  site and then they come back because they didn't get the answer they wanted. And then the one box [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5248.34s)]
*  launched, which shows a short answer on the top, which basically keeps people from having a bad [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5252.900000000001s)]
*  search experience because they get the result right away. So a key metric is they're going to [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5258.02s)]
*  start to discover which vertical searches, meaning like, Hey, cooking recipes, that kind of stuff, [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5262.02s)]
*  like you're referencing, there's lots and lots of these different types of searches that will trigger [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5269.22s)]
*  a snippet or a one box that's powered by Gemini that will provide the user a better experience [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5274.34s)]
*  than them jumping off to a third party page to get that same content. And then they'll be able [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5279.860000000001s)]
*  to monetize that content that they otherwise were not participating in the monetization of. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5284.26s)]
*  So I think the real victim in all this is that long tail of content on the internet [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5289.78s)]
*  that probably gets cannibalized by the snippet one box experience within the search function. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5294.66s)]
*  And then I do think that the revenue per search query in some of those categories actually [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5299.38s)]
*  has the potential to go up, not down. Explain, give me an example. You keep people on the page, [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5304.18s)]
*  so you get more, more search volume there. You get more searches because of the examples you gave. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5308.9800000000005s)]
*  And then when people do stay, you now have the ability to better monetize that particular search [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5315.46s)]
*  query because you otherwise would have lost it to the third party content page. So for example, [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5320.5s)]
*  selling the steak knives is another, you know, it's kind of a good example or booking the travel [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5325.38s)]
*  directly and so on. So by keeping more of the experience integrated, they can monetize the [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5330.34s)]
*  search per query higher and they're going to have more queries and then they're going to have the [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5335.22s)]
*  quality of the queries go up. So I think it's all in, there's a case to be made. I haven't done a [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5341.38s)]
*  spreadsheet analysis on this, but I guarantee you going back to our earlier point about precision [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5346.58s)]
*  versus accuracy, my guess is there's a lot of hedge fund type folks doing a lot of this precision [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5351.3s)]
*  type analysis, trying to break apart search queries by vertical and trying to figure out [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5356.26s)]
*  what the net effect will be of having better AI driven one box and snippets. And my guess is [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5361.54s)]
*  that's why there's a lot of buying activity happening in the stock right now. And I think [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5365.9400000000005s)]
*  they're probably all missing to Moff's point, a lot of these call options like isomorphic labs. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5368.900000000001s)]
*  I can tell you Meta and Amazon, Meta and Amazon do not have an isomorphic lab in Waymo sitting [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5375.9400000000005s)]
*  inside their business that suddenly pops to a couple hundred billion of market cap. And Google [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5381.46s)]
*  does have a few of those. So other bets could actually pay off. Look, I mean, there's Calico, [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5385.78s)]
*  no one talks about Calico. I don't know what's going on. Let me get Sax involved in this [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5391.46s)]
*  discussion. Sax, when we show that example, it's obvious. Google is telling you where they got [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5395.3s)]
*  these citations from and how they built their how to clean your couch, how to make your stake. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5401.54s)]
*  Those, they were in a very delicate balance with content creators over the past two decades, [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5405.78s)]
*  which is, Hey, we're going to use a little bit of your content, but we're going to send you traffic. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5410.0199999999995s)]
*  This is going to take away the need to send traffic to these places. They're going to benefit [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5415.38s)]
*  from it. To me, this is the mother of all class action lawsuits because they're putting it right [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5420.26s)]
*  up there. Hey, we're using your content to make this answer. Here's the citations. We didn't get [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5424.82s)]
*  your permission to do this, but we're doing it anyway. What do you think is the resolution here? [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5430.179999999999s)]
*  Does all these content go away because there's no model? Does Google try to make peace with the [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5434.82s)]
*  content creators and cut them in or license their data? What's going to happen to content creation? [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5439.54s)]
*  When somebody like Google is just going to take wire cutter or these other sources that are not [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5444.58s)]
*  behind a paywall and just give you the answer. Well, look, this is the same conversation we've [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5449.78s)]
*  had two or three times where we're going to need the courts to figure out what fair use is. And [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5454.98s)]
*  depending on what they come up with, it may be the case that Google has to cut them in by licensing, [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5459.54s)]
*  by doing licensing deals. We don't know the answer to that yet. By the way, I do know a founder who [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5464.98s)]
*  is already skating to where the puck is going and creating a rights marketplace so that content [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5469.46s)]
*  owners can license their AI rights to whoever wants to use them. I think that could be very [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5475.7s)]
*  interesting. I had a call with him yesterday and you and I will be on that cap table together. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5480.5s)]
*  So I don't want to say who it is because we can't let him announce his own round, but only [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5486.18s)]
*  participating in the seed round. Look, stepping back here, it's interesting. If you go back to [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5489.9400000000005s)]
*  the very beginning of Google, the OG Google search bar had two buttons on it, right? Search [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5494.42s)]
*  and I feel lucky. I feel lucky was just tell me the answer, just take me to the best result. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5499.38s)]
*  And no one ever did that because it kind of sucked. Then they started inching towards with one box, [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5505.06s)]
*  but it wasn't, you didn't get the one box very often. It's very clear now that Gemini powered [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5510.26s)]
*  one box is the future of Google search. People just want the answer. I think that this feature [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5514.74s)]
*  is going to eat the rest of Google search. Now it's a little bit unclear what the financial [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5521.0599999999995s)]
*  impact of that will be. I think like you guys are saying, there'll be probably be more searches [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5527.54s)]
*  because search gets more useful. There's fewer blue links to click on, but maybe they'll get [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5530.9s)]
*  compensated through those relevant ads. Hard to say. You're probably right that Google ultimately [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5536.58s)]
*  benefits here, but let's not pretend this was a deliberate strategy on their point. They got [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5541.94s)]
*  dragged kicking and screaming into this by innovation and perplexity and other companies. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5547.7s)]
*  They had no idea. They got caught completely flat-footed and they've now, I guess, caught up by [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5552.9s)]
*  copying perplexity and sucks for perplexity. I think they're kind of screwed now unless they get [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5557.94s)]
*  it. And an acquisition deal. But perplexity came up with the idea of having citations. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5563.22s)]
*  In having a comprehensive search results. Yeah. Which was something search result with [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5571.0599999999995s)]
*  citations and related questions. And they did it extremely well. And quite frankly, [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5575.94s)]
*  all Google had to do was copy them. Now they've done that. And I think it does look like a killer. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5580.5s)]
*  And by the way, this was all something that I saw 15 years ago when I did Mahalo, which was my human [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5584.9s)]
*  powered search engine and which I had copied or been inspired by Naver and Daum in Korea. They [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5590.179999999999s)]
*  were the first ones to do this. You know it, Chamath, because there were only three or four [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5595.78s)]
*  markets where Google couldn't displace the number one. Korea, Russia, Japan. Russia had, [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5599.86s)]
*  what was the Russian search engine? God, I can't remember now. Japan had Yahoo Japan, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5606.9s)]
*  which Masayoshi-san had carved out. He was never part of it. And they were loyal to that. And very [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5612.099999999999s)]
*  nationalistic Koreans and very innovative folks at Daum and Naver just made search. That was so [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5616.339999999999s)]
*  amazing. You do a search and you'd be like, here's music, here's images, here's answers, [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5624.74s)]
*  Q&A. It was awesome. But you know, it just shows you like you need to have a lot of wherewithal [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5629.3s)]
*  and timing is everything as an entrepreneur. My timing was 10 years too early and the wrong [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5634.34s)]
*  technology. I used humans, not AI, because AI didn't work 15 years ago. One thing I would say [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5637.9400000000005s)]
*  about big companies like Google or Microsoft is that the power of your monopoly determines how [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5642.900000000001s)]
*  many mistakes you get to make. So think about Microsoft completely missed iPhone. Remember, [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5649.14s)]
*  they screwed up the whole smartphone mobile phone era. And it didn't matter. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5656.34s)]
*  Didn't matter. Sacha comes in, blows this thing up to a $3 trillion public company. Same thing here [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5659.86s)]
*  with Google. They completely screwed up AI. They invented the transformer, completely missed LLMs. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5664.9s)]
*  Then they had that fiasco where they had Black George Washington. Black George Washington. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5670.58s)]
*  Doesn't matter. They can make 10 mistakes, but their monopoly is so strong that they can finally [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5675.62s)]
*  get it right by copying the innovator. And they're probably going to become a $5 billion company now. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5680.34s)]
*  Sorry, $5 trillion company. It reminds me, the greatest product creation company in history. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5685.06s)]
*  I think we all know who that was. And take a look down memory lane. Here are the 20 biggest [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5691.780000000001s)]
*  failed Apple products of all time. The Apple Lisa, Macintosh Portable. We all remember the Newton, [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5696.900000000001s)]
*  which was their PDA. The 20th anniversary Macintosh super sexy. People don't remember. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5703.620000000001s)]
*  They had their own video game. I was at a conference a couple years ago [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5709.22s)]
*  that Jeff Bezos spoke at. I think he's given this talk in a couple other places. You could [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5713.78s)]
*  probably find it on the internet, but he talks about Amazon's legacy of failure and how they [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5719.06s)]
*  had the Fire Phone and the Fire This and the Fire That. And he's like, our job is to fail. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5724.5s)]
*  Big swings. We have to make these blunders, but what makes us successful is that we learn from [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5729.9400000000005s)]
*  the failures and we make the right next decision. Yeah. But I say if you're a startup and you make [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5734.1s)]
*  big failures, you usually just go out of business. One and done. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5740.18s)]
*  Yeah. But this is how you stay competitive. If you're a big founder led tech company, [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5743.06s)]
*  the only way you're going to have a shot at staying relevant is to take big shots that you're [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5749.3s)]
*  going to fail at. I just don't know. You can't just- You have to do things that you're going to [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5754.900000000001s)]
*  fail at. Right. Remember this boombox? This is one of the huge different stream startups and big [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5760.02s)]
*  companies is that big companies can afford to have a portfolio of products. They have a portfolio [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5763.780000000001s)]
*  of bets. Some of them will work and that keeps the company going. Startup really has to go all [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5767.78s)]
*  in on their best idea. Totally. I always tell founders, just go all in on your best idea. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5771.94s)]
*  They're always asking me for permission to pivot. And I always tell them, go for the best idea. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5776.099999999999s)]
*  Don't hedge. Don't try to do five things at once. Just go all in on your best idea. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5782.34s)]
*  Yeah. And if it doesn't work out, you reboot and start with a new cap table. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5786.66s)]
*  You're going to go all in. So to speak, another amazing episode is in the can. The boys are in a [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5790.82s)]
*  good mood. You got your great episode. No guests this week. Just all bestie all the time. And very [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5796.98s)]
*  important, the March to a million continues halfway there. You got us there, fans. We hit [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5803.86s)]
*  500,000 subbies on YouTube, which means you all learned a live Q&A with your besties coming at [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5809.94s)]

*  continue. Phil Hellmuth has tweeted. He's no longer with open AI. You guys like my baby cashmere pink [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5840.74s)]

*  you going to go linen? When does linen show up? The unbuttoning is about to happen in the next two [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5853.7s)]
*  or three weeks. The great unbuttoning. This is how you know. It's kind of like Groundhog Day. You [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5858.9s)]
*  know that summer's here when you lose Chimatsu buttons. It's almost here. Memorial day. After [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDr1983LIuo&t=5862.98s)]
