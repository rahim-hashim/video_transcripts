# New SEC Chair, Bitcoin, xAI Supercomputer, UnitedHealth CEO murder, with Gavin Baker & Joe Lonsdale
**All In Podcast:** [December 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4)
*  Hey, everybody. Hey, everybody. Before we drop this week's amazing episode, just some quick [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=0.0s)]
*  information for you. Sax and Chamoff both had the week off. So we had two amazing friends of the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=5.76s)]
*  pod on Gavin Baker from a treaties and Joe Lonsdale from eight VC. What a treat to have [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=11.44s)]
*  them on the program. But there is some big news, huh? Freeberg? Yeah, well, the news dropped after [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=16.56s)]
*  we recorded. So it's not going to be referenced and the show might feel a little stale. But [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=21.44s)]
*  here we go. Our friend David Sachs is the White House AI and crypto czar of the United States [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=27.2s)]
*  of America. Congratulations to our boy. Amazing. Super thrilled. That is a big reason why he wasn't [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=33.68s)]
*  able to join us for the show. He was in the middle of getting this news ramped up. Yes, it came out. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=38.72s)]
*  We had already recorded. Yeah, take that into account as we go into the show. Yes. And according [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=43.04s)]
*  to Trump's Truth Social Post, Sachs will quote, guide policy for the administration in artificial [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=47.44s)]
*  intelligence and cryptocurrency. He will also lead the presidential council of advisors for [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=54.56s)]
*  science and technology. How great is that? Freeberg? Wow. Science corner in the White House. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=59.68s)]
*  Can't wait. It's going to be fun. It's going to be amazing. Pretty awesome. I have no announcements. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=64.88s)]
*  The rumors about me becoming press secretary are obviously premature, but if asked to serve, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  I will serve my country. OK, let's get to it. Don't worry besties. All in isn't going anywhere. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=74.0s)]
*  We'll be here every week for you, except maybe Thanksgiving or a holiday now and again. All right, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=80.32s)]
*  let's start the show. How freebar great episode. Let's go. All right, everybody. Welcome to the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=85.27999999999999s)]
*  all in podcast. I am your host, Jason Calacanis. How are you doing? Friedberg? I'm hanging in there. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  I'm waiting for the tsunami to hit. It's gonna we're about 40 minutes away. I'm a little anxious [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=96.56s)]
*  right now. More anxious than normal is what you're saying. Like on a scale of one to freeburg, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=101.6s)]
*  this is like as anxious as you get with the tsunami. I don't know what's gonna happen. This [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=107.84s)]
*  current warning shows a five foot water rise or five meter. I can't tell. God, I really hope we [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=112.48s)]
*  don't publish this episode. And there's like a total disaster that we're kind of making light of [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  it. We're not going to make light of it. We get warnings once in a while just to give everybody [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=124.4s)]
*  a little perspective here. I'm at David Sachs house. I've taken over. As you can see, I got my [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=129.44s)]
*  Montclair hat on freeburg. I found Sachs's robe. It was Sachs's robe. I got a red sharpie. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=135.12s)]
*  And then I went down and I was talking to chef. The sex know that you're staying in his house. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=142.8s)]
*  He knows I'm staying here. But does he though he doesn't know that I found the actual cabbie heart. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  And then we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=165.12s)]
*  With us today, Jamal couldn't make it this week. And surgery and now he looks like Gavin. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=173.36s)]
*  Okay, yes. Yeah. And Sachs is taking a day off. He's he's he's got the day off today. I think [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=179.12s)]
*  he's just winning too much with us to substitute. So jump in here for the team. Cackling. You can [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=187.84s)]
*  hear the cackling Joe Lonsdale. There's Joe Lonsdale. Take my Montclair hat off here. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=194.16s)]
*  I'm also winning too much. But I'm happy to be here last minute as a sub for David J. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=200.64s)]
*  J. Cole. Joe Lonsdale for people don't know is to the right of David Sachs. He is a venture [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=205.28s)]
*  capitalist and he started a couple of companies. You might have heard of them Palantir. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=210.64s)]
*  And what are the other greatest hits at a par at a par just across $7 trillion was reported on it [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=215.2s)]
*  this month. It's a real company too. Yeah, the open gov sold this year. We saw started a bunch [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=219.6s)]
*  of congrats. Good. Yeah. Joe gets he's a little bit lower profile than all these accomplishments. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=223.76s)]
*  It's pretty incredible co founded. How many billion dollar companies have you co founded now? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  I don't know maybe six or so. Six or so. Also with us Gavin Baker from a treaties. He is a [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=235.6s)]
*  hedge fund manager. He does private he does Publix. One of the smartest guys I know, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=243.04s)]
*  great analysts. Welcome to the program, Gavin friend of the pod. Thank you, Jay, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=247.68s)]
*  Cal. Happy to be here. Great to see everybody. Yeah, we are experiencing a huge Trump bump. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=251.2s)]
*  The election is over. The cabinet is being assembled and we're seeing Doge the Department [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=257.76s)]
*  of Government efficiency, as well as maybe regulations being pulled down and we'll we'll [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=263.44s)]
*  get to our first topic about our new SEC chair. But just generally speaking, Gavin as a market [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=269.52s)]
*  participant for a living. What's your take on what we've seen over the last three weeks [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=275.84s)]
*  since the election results came in? So if they execute unstated plans, and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=281.76s)]
*  there are some of the world's greatest execution machines involved, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  you know, Elon generally does what he says he's going to do. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=296.0s)]
*  Like this is going to be awesome for America for markets for the world. And the analogy I keep [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=299.68s)]
*  coming back to is Satya Nadella taking over CEO of Microsoft. Microsoft was a monopoly, incredibly [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  advantaged, and it just been horribly mismanaged for years. All he had to do to start winning was [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=315.68s)]
*  stop doing really, really dumb things. And that's an incredible place to be, you know, America, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=321.44s)]
*  like we're the greatest country, you know, we've got, you know, oceans on two sides, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=328.88s)]
*  peaceful neighbors, incredible natural resources, you know, completely, you know, can produce our [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=333.12s)]
*  own food and energy, like in many ways, most privileged country on earth. But sometimes [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=338.32s)]
*  with great privilege comes great, like stupidity. And California, to me, would be a leading example [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=343.68s)]
*  of that most, in many ways, most privileged state in America, and has printed it away with bad [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=348.72s)]
*  policies. And I do think one thing that everyone of all political stripes agrees on, is there are [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  too many regulations that result in far too many administrators, far too much complexity, and an [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=362.8s)]
*  inability to build things in America. So, you know, it was used very effectively, and as it should [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=369.36s)]
*  have been against the Harris administration, that they'd approved $42 billion for rural broadband, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=377.36s)]
*  hadn't built anything, had approved $40 billion for EV chargers, whatever it was, hadn't done [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=382.48s)]
*  anything. And it's not that they didn't want to, you know, dig trenches and do broadband, they [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  didn't want to make EV chargers, their own regulations prevented them. So I just think [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=394.56s)]
*  deregulation and simplifying regulations and the tax code is going to lead to an immense amount [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=401.2s)]
*  of growth, which is something that all Americans should be happy about. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=410.64s)]
*  Aaron Norris Joe, you want to maybe give us your take? I know, obviously, you're very vocal, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=413.76s)]
*  you're obviously a conservative, run a think tank and have strong feelings on all this. But [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=419.03999999999996s)]
*  there is consensus, I think, amongst all Americans that we don't like fraud, waste, abuse, and those [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=424.08s)]
*  items, those seem to be consensus building, efficiency and paying lower taxes, all of that [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=429.12s)]
*  seems like something almost all Americans, most Americans can get behind. So I guess maybe a [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=434.32s)]
*  little bit of your take on what we've seen in the markets and the plan. And then also, are you going [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=440.64s)]
*  to be involved in this at all? Well, listen, Jake, I think I do agree, I think almost all [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=446.08s)]
*  reasonable Americans can see that our growth is ridiculously constrained. And I think Jeff Bezos [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=452.24s)]
*  was saying yesterday, like, we need a growth oriented mindset if we're going to get out of our [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=456.72s)]
*  debt problems, our deficit problems. So it's nice to see everyone kind of coming on the team and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=460.96000000000004s)]
*  saying, yeah, we need to fix these things. I think what people don't understand is like just how [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=465.04s)]
*  broken the government bureaucracy and regulations are, right? It's not like they're kind of sort of [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=469.92s)]
*  bad. Like it's almost like they're companies that went bankrupt. Like think of the worst company, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=475.12s)]
*  you know, in Silicon Valley, they went bankrupt, like 30 years ago. And imagine if someone just [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=479.12s)]
*  like kept pumping money into that worst company, you know, over like 30 years to keep hiring people. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=483.68s)]
*  So like Yahoo or AOL, like some legacy company, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=489.2s)]
*  it was failing and take the worst department there. And then like the worst department gets [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=493.68s)]
*  the most money. So it's like, it's like, it's like more, I guess you can use it, we're retarded now, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=497.2s)]
*  it's more retarded than anything you've seen in a long time. And I think one of the important [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=502.64s)]
*  things is America used to have these really hard tests for 100 years, you know, this in 1883, we [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=507.04s)]
*  said, you know what, we shouldn't just hire our friends. If someone's going to run something in [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=512.24s)]
*  government, let's have these tough tests, kind of like China did for thousands of years. And for 100 [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=515.84s)]
*  years, we had really hard tests. When we went to the moon, when we fought the world wars, you know, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=521.04s)]
*  we did the Manhattan Project, the people making those decisions in hiring people had to pass [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=525.04s)]
*  things that really only like five, 10% of people could pass who took them. And then in the late [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=529.76s)]
*  70s, we said, not only are these tests racist, so we can't test people anymore of any background, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=533.92s)]
*  we also can't fire people anymore, because we're going to give them tons of protections. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=539.52s)]
*  So for the last 40 years, it just got dumber. And then 10 years ago, you started doing all the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=542.56s)]
*  virtue signaling and, and, you know, hiring based on your identity versus based on anything else. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=547.12s)]
*  So it's gotten even worse. And so now it's so broken that yes, we're letting tens of billions [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=551.92s)]
*  of dollars on fire. And so there's really two things here. One, you got to take a chainsaw, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=555.92s)]
*  as Ilan said, you got to take a chainsaw and just like cut a ton of broken stuff. But then [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=560.16s)]
*  day two is you got to say, how do we make this not stupid in the future? And there's things like [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=564.56s)]
*  maybe you bring back tests, maybe you bring accountability. The thing I'm most passionate [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=568.8s)]
*  about is, you know, right now there's over a million rules at the federal level. It's stuff [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=573.28s)]
*  that everyone disagrees on. You give me the most left person trying to build like solar or wind or [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=577.4399999999999s)]
*  whatever. And you're like, what I have to do what study over how many years? This makes no sense. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=581.92s)]
*  So we got it, we got to, we got to take these regulations and not only cut them, but we got [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=585.68s)]
*  to make a data driven system that forces regulations to defend themselves. And that way, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=589.1999999999999s)]
*  instead of having a cancer, it just grows forever out of control. You could actually have a process [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=593.12s)]
*  that like naturally trims things, naturally makes things fight for itself. And that way doesn't get [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=598.3199999999999s)]
*  as dumb ever again. I would, why not just make them automatically sunsetting after five years, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=602.56s)]
*  if they're not renewed. Exactly. But make the process to renew them difficult and data driven. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=607.4399999999999s)]
*  Exactly. So basically, yeah, yeah. So if you renew them, we'll take so much time that it will slow [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=611.68s)]
*  it down. I wonder where we got to the place, Friedberg, I will bring you in on this since [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=619.12s)]
*  really, I think it was maybe two or three years ago, you started to point out exactly the debt [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=623.5999999999999s)]
*  spiral we're going to get in. I want to give you your flowers here on the pod, because from this pod [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=628.8s)]
*  and in your obsession, and you're harping on and on about this national debt problem, you saw it [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=633.5999999999999s)]
*  early, you talked about it constantly, you brought a lot of consensus on board, and now we're seeing [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=640.9599999999999s)]
*  it as the issue of the transition is the debt. And we were sitting here for the past year or two, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=645.5999999999999s)]
*  saying, when are politicians going to even pay attention to this? And now they are paying [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=651.12s)]
*  attention to it. So first, here's your virtual flowers. Second, how are you feeling about the [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=655.84s)]
*  transition today? Well, I mean, I think, first of all, there's like three layers of the problem, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=662.0s)]
*  which I've been trying to harp on for almost four years. Number one is the inefficiency and lack of [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=666.5600000000001s)]
*  accountability, which Joe and Gavin are obviously talking about. And that leads to excessive [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=670.32s)]
*  spending. And that leads to the debt problem. And the debt problem creates this kind of arithmetic [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=675.52s)]
*  death spiral, which is something you don't want to find yourself in. So that's the inevitability [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=681.2s)]
*  that I've been kind of really worried about. And I think that, you know, look, there's the first [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=686.4000000000001s)]
*  derivative and second derivative can kind of get addressed. And then hopefully, you don't get to [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=690.96s)]
*  the absolute point where you have this breaking point. I think right now everyone's banking, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=694.64s)]
*  number one on, can we deregulate in a way that can unlock growth? And by unlocking growth, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=698.96s)]
*  that right, the kind of arithmetic argument is grow GDP, because you're not going to be able to [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=704.72s)]
*  shrink debt super fast. In order to grow GDP, there needs to be some unleashing happening. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=710.48s)]
*  And so if you can get GDP to grow four, 5%, and you can minimize the excess spending, meaning you [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=717.04s)]
*  can minimize the deficit, the federal deficit, and therefore minimize the increment in the debt [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=724.08s)]
*  level, the debt to GDP ratio becomes more manageable, because ultimately, you can only tax so much of GDP. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=729.2s)]
*  So yeah, I feel like this is important in both senses. One is just cut the inefficient waste [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=735.28s)]
*  for spending, get rid of the regulations, and that'll unleash the necessary growth. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=740.32s)]
*  One of the proxies I look to, and I think that this is going to be kind of the critical motivating [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=745.9200000000001s)]
*  factor for the United States, whether it's this administration or the next or on a continuous [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=750.8000000000001s)]
*  basis, there's going to be this kind of moment where we're going to look across the water at [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=755.7600000000001s)]
*  what China has. And you can see what China's getting, what China is making, what China is doing. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=760.96s)]
*  I've talked about this a lot as well. And I do think this is the most critical [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=766.96s)]
*  metric that no one talks about as much as I think we should, which is the increment [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=770.5600000000001s)]
*  in electricity production capacity in China compared to the United States. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=775.36s)]
*  And so we are going from one terawatt to two terawatts. They're going from, I think, two to eight [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=780.16s)]
*  over the same time period. And they're doing it. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=785.36s)]
*  Why is that so important for the people who are listening who think that you're saying... [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=787.04s)]
*  I'll let Gavin Harper, I'll let Joe answer that. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=790.4s)]
*  Joe, go ahead. Just unpack it for the audience. I mean, I obviously understand why this is important, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=793.04s)]
*  but I want you to... [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=797.04s)]
*  The number one thing I'd say is it's usually correlated to how well the working class [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=797.76s)]
*  is doing in your country, to per capita GDP, to cost of goods. I mean, obviously I care about it [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=802.24s)]
*  because we want to scale AI for all the things we're doing and we want to be able to do it [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=807.3599999999999s)]
*  effectively. But if you just look over time, it's really clear the relationship between how well is [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=810.7199999999999s)]
*  your average working middle-class person doing in their quality of life, their cost of life, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=815.8399999999999s)]
*  and the cost of electricity and cost of power. It's crazy we're not just ramping up and cutting [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=819.68s)]
*  things to do this. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=824.3199999999999s)]
*  More electricity means more automation, means more AI, means more things are being done for [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=825.3599999999999s)]
*  every person that are being done in factories or being done by machines. And that unlocks [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=831.3599999999999s)]
*  a new level of living. And that's been a continuous process for humans. There's this guy that [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=837.92s)]
*  writes these books that Bill Gates always talks about, Vaclav Smir? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=843.8399999999999s)]
*  Smil. Smil. Vaclav Smil. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=848.48s)]
*  He's got all these books on the history of the relationship between energy and kind of [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=851.2800000000001s)]
*  prosperity. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=855.0400000000001s)]
*  There's definitely correlation there and there's definitely causation there, Gavin. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=855.84s)]
*  There's even like really simple ones. I don't know if you've ever seen Lee Kuan Yew from, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=861.2s)]
*  you know, the founder of Singapore essentially talk about just how air conditioning [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=865.44s)]
*  changed the country's fate. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=870.72s)]
*  It raises average IQ by two or three points. It really matters. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=872.96s)]
*  But look, at the end of the day, my key point was we have to make sure that this administration [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=876.88s)]
*  and Joe can hear me on this. And I know he believes this. But for me, it has to be such [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=884.16s)]
*  a priority that we accelerate a nuclear energy rollout in the United States, because that's [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=888.8s)]
*  what China's doing. They have dozens of Gen 4 reactors that are going to get built out, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=894.8s)]
*  each of which has a gigawatt of production capacity. And they're doing it at a cost that [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=899.4399999999999s)]
*  we can't compete with today. But fundamentally, they can do it. In the US, we can't even do it. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=904.56s)]
*  And regulations, it goes back to Joe. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=910.0s)]
*  Yeah. And so the regulatory structure prohibits our ability to actually expand energy capacity [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=911.8399999999999s)]
*  or electricity production capacity, which is a critical difference. And that ultimately leads to [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=916.88s)]
*  a situation where in 10 years, we're going to be looking across the water at, you know, a competitive [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=921.92s)]
*  country that has 3x, 4x the electricity production capacity of our country. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=928.2399999999999s)]
*  And everything is cheaper. Everything is faster. It gives them superiority and a lot of functions [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=933.92s)]
*  that we can't just this is a security thing too, because we need manufacturing here to be [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=938.8s)]
*  affordable and competitive in order for national security. You know, David, when you when you [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=942.88s)]
*  texted me last minute to join this, I was actually meeting with our friend from Founders Fund, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=946.56s)]
*  who's building nuclear fuel again for the first time in the US, that's actually gone away too. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=950.0799999999999s)]
*  And so that needs to be approved. But you know, I know Chris Wright, he's a nominee for the new [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=954.4s)]
*  energy, a secretary of energy. And he, you know, he's super pro Liberty guy, but super pro cheap, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=959.2s)]
*  cheap energy guy. He's pro nuclear. So I think we have some really great people who care about [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=963.84s)]
*  this. We're going to be fighting hard for it. What's your read on it? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=967.36s)]
*  Yeah, what's your read on energy and the blockers? Yeah, I mean, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=970.4s)]
*  more nuclear, more better. Like, I mean, I agree with everything Joe said. And the only thing I [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=974.32s)]
*  just add is it is the most environmentally friendly kind of energy source. It's even more [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=979.6s)]
*  I think it is highly likely that in my lifetime, the world just runs on solar. Like if you just, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=988.64s)]
*  you know, we all know compound interest is the greatest force on earth. But if you just look [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=995.2s)]
*  at the rate at which photovoltaic cell efficiency is compounding, battery efficiency is compounding, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=999.76s)]
*  and people make these balance of system arguments. But it will it will never be as cheap as nuclear, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1005.92s)]
*  but it will likely approach coal. And I think a lot of the world will run on solar, but that's [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1012.4s)]
*  going to take 50 years. Nuclear is arguably just as environmentally friendly done right and carefully, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1017.2s)]
*  and it is here now. And so I just Yeah, I mean, that's yeah, I don't want to watch. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1024.48s)]
*  It is unbelievable to watch. Not exactly Moore's law, but this precipitous drop in [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1031.28s)]
*  the cost of just solar panels. Solar is very solar is very impressive. But in some ways, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1038.0800000000002s)]
*  to me, it's a little dystopian to think about all these forests just covered with this stuff. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1043.1200000000001s)]
*  It's rate limiting. It's rate limiting. You have you have to have many, many acres rolled out. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1047.2800000000002s)]
*  And with nuclear, you can have a building that can, you know, power the equivalent of many acres. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1053.1200000000001s)]
*  So the answer is both the answers both. But it is like you want to tweet it many times about the [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1058.0s)]
*  tiny fraction of, you know, deserted desert areas of America that need to be covered with panels. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1062.88s)]
*  And then you put in batteries, there's still a space limiting like, let's just fast forward [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1070.8000000000002s)]
*  100 years on planet Earth. And if you look at the past 100 years and the 100 years before that, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1075.44s)]
*  like energy demand, even on a on a per capita basis, has this nonlinear kind of scaling problem. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1081.04s)]
*  And that means that land consumption will scale nonlinearly. Now we have it. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1089.04s)]
*  If we're gonna say 100 years, though, I mean, sorry, I interrupted, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1092.88s)]
*  you're gonna say 100 years, technology changes, it's very clear, you could probably do it from [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1095.04s)]
*  space if you really want it to. I mean, this sounds crazy, but you probably could have like [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1098.16s)]
*  tons of these in space. I mean, 100 years is far. I mean, we have enough uranium and just the crust [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1101.92s)]
*  of the, you know, like northern hemisphere to power everything we could imagine. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1106.8000000000002s)]
*  In other words, we are on the verge of unlimited energy for all time. Just to wrap this up and move [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1112.96s)]
*  us on. If we can get out of our own way. Get out of our own way with a bunch of midwits who have put [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1117.68s)]
*  so much regulation in place and who are working from home for four hours a week. If we can just [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1123.3600000000001s)]
*  get them out of the way, then maybe we could approve some nuclear reactors and a little more [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1128.64s)]
*  solar batteries. Did you just call government workers midwits? Just the ones who are blocking [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1133.2800000000002s)]
*  s***. If you're not blocking s*** and you're working 50 hours a week, god bless. A lot of people [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1139.0400000000002s)]
*  working hard in the government. That's exactly my point. But there's some number of them who are [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1143.5200000000002s)]
*  just obviously do not see the forest through the trees. By the way, on that point, Jake, how [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1147.76s)]
*  it is interesting, Texas is the number one solar producer in the country. And it's not because [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1151.6000000000001s)]
*  everybody there is more environmentally conscious. No, we're not that liberal here. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1157.52s)]
*  It's just, it's easy to build stuff in Texas. You have to build solar power plants. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1162.08s)]
*  This is I mean, for the libs in cities who are so pro solar and anti natural gas or whatever. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1167.76s)]
*  Yeah, look at Texas, they're just built as much as you want. And where Joe and I live in Austin, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1174.4s)]
*  home prices have gone down two years in a row. Rent has gone down two years in a row. They are [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1179.28s)]
*  building like lunatics because you don't need to beg and bribe people to build stuff. Joe, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1185.44s)]
*  maybe some thoughts on what we've seen in regulation. Austin City Council is not perfect. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1192.56s)]
*  Austin, they call it the blueberry and the tomato soup. So there may be a tiny bit of begging going [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1197.76s)]
*  on. But despite that, you're able to build there and everywhere else around your building like mad. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1201.44s)]
*  So it works. There's there's there's plenty of supply. I agree. Speaking of regulation, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1205.04s)]
*  Gary Gensler is out. Paul Atkins is in and Bitcoin just cracked 100. This is all obviously [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1208.96s)]
*  related. Atkins was previously se commissioner under Bush two in the early 2000s. In the 90s, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1215.36s)]
*  he worked for both Bush one and Clinton at the SEC. According to the New York Times, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1220.7199999999998s)]
*  Atkins is admired among DC legal circles and regulators. He's pro crypto. And he's been helping [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1224.9599999999998s)]
*  draft some best practices for the crypto trading platforms. As you know, Gary Gensler's approach [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1232.8s)]
*  to crypto was there's a rule set, follow the rule set. We're not here to change the rules. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1238.9599999999998s)]
*  We're here to enforce them. Good luck. And in some cases, I think maybe he was right with ICOs [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1244.48s)]
*  and a bunch of scams. But he also gave good actors no path to go forward. Anybody have strong [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1251.44s)]
*  feelings on this? I love Paul J. Kelly. I think he's I think he's gonna you know, our guy. Yeah, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1257.68s)]
*  I've been in several times at conferences and groups. And he's really smart guy. cares about [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1262.16s)]
*  the rules cares about helping innovators. I think the thing that really pissed off he went off with [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1266.16s)]
*  Gary. I mean, I love you probably seen like, I think I think I think both Coinbase with Brian [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1269.84s)]
*  and the Winklevoss twins have put something out. They won't even hire anyone who worked with Gary [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1275.28s)]
*  on this stuff they were doing. And the reason they're that angry at them is they were purposely not [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1279.52s)]
*  defining the rules in certain cases and then going after people after not having to find it in order [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1283.6799999999998s)]
*  to kind of like play a gotcha game. It was very dishonorable. And Paul sees all that there's no [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1289.28s)]
*  way he's gonna allow that. Gavin, any thoughts here on how this might change regulations in our [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1293.6s)]
*  business? Also the fund business Joe is a venture capitalist, ABC, you're in public markets and funds. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1298.8s)]
*  I have I do precede. So yeah, what do you think in terms of funds and regulations there and then [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1305.68s)]
*  crypto and you know, the SEC may be becoming innovative as opposed to punitive and, you know, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1310.56s)]
*  what's the word for free program? What's the word I'm looking for here? adversarial? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1319.36s)]
*  Well, they are a regulator. They are a regulator. They're not meant to see, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1325.1200000000001s)]
*  they seem to have gone beyond just regulating. They seem to have been [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1328.88s)]
*  aggressively adversarial. Yeah, I mean, they're a regulatory enforcement agency. That's their job. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1332.56s)]
*  So I don't know, like, you know, I mean, but not giving a path or not even meeting with people. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1337.44s)]
*  I think that was the thing that I felt was kind of weird. Well, they made me feel if you were a big [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1343.1200000000001s)]
*  donor to the left, they wouldn't meet with you. Otherwise, that was part of it, too. That was [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1346.56s)]
*  sketchy. That was why SBF got tons of meetings. But Brian got none. Right. I mean, it's nonsense [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1349.28s)]
*  like that. I do think cryptocurrencies at some level fundamentally reduce the power [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1353.28s)]
*  of nation states. And that is something that is [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1359.84s)]
*  oft professed by the true believers, but it is true. And so if you are on the left and, you know, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1364.24s)]
*  you are a devout believer in the power of the state to do good things, I get why you would not [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1372.96s)]
*  like cryptocurrencies. You know, at the same time, we're very early in crypto. I do think [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1378.48s)]
*  I read with interest all of the posts that David Marcus and his peers at Libra made made about what [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1384.8s)]
*  happened to them. Libra was a Facebook project to embrace cryptocurrency at a very intrinsic level [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1392.24s)]
*  onto the sort of identity level of every one of their billions of users. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1400.0s)]
*  And I think you can argue it would have been really, really good for not just America, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1404.56s)]
*  but the entire world. You know, there are a lot of immigrants in America who send remissions back [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1408.08s)]
*  to their home countries at extremely high predatory rates. It would have made that free. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1414.72s)]
*  And that would have been amazing for a lot of really hardworking people all over the world. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1423.4399999999998s)]
*  It would have, you know, Visa and MasterCard, they do charge big fees. I mean, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1429.1999999999998s)]
*  not Visa and MasterCard do not charge big fees, but the credit card complex and aggregate [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1433.68s)]
*  is a reasonably big fee. I mean, everybody, oh, it's just, you know, two, two and a half percent [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1438.8799999999999s)]
*  to make it, you know, perfect and safe. I think Facebook had a sound argument that they could have [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1443.04s)]
*  done that cheaper. That would have been an efficiency game for America. And it really [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1448.08s)]
*  did bum me out, you know, to read some of the letters that they sent the way they killed Libra. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1452.8s)]
*  If anyone doesn't know, maybe we could, you can pull up David Marcus's post. They just, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1460.4s)]
*  all these politicians sent letters to participants in financial markets saying, we don't know if they [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1465.2s)]
*  are doing anything wrong, but we think they probably are. And we're going to look at this [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1471.52s)]
*  very closely and we want to discourage you from participating. It was worse than that. It was [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1476.96s)]
*  like a mafia letter. It was like, if you are to support this and help with this, we are going to [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1483.1200000000001s)]
*  look into everything else you are doing and we may then find some issues. It was like a mafia [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1487.36s)]
*  threat. We can't stop you legally, but watch out. Like it was really sketchy. It was Sherrod Brown, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1491.6s)]
*  who now is out of office, who led this, the Senator from Ohio, but it was really bad. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1496.6399999999999s)]
*  It was really bad what they were doing. It was really bad. I found it upsetting as an American. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1500.7199999999998s)]
*  And it's, you kind of hinted at this, Gavin, the fear of governments is that they will lose control [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1505.36s)]
*  of money supply and monetary policy. Maybe unpack that a bit and then Freberg will go to you on the [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1512.8s)]
*  same sort of threat. Yeah. I mean, look, it is a rational fear. I mean, controlling monetary supply, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1518.08s)]
*  at some level, the greatest powers we give the state are a monopoly on violence to keep us safe. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1525.68s)]
*  And control over the money supply has a means of exchange, a unit of account. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1534.24s)]
*  And those are great powers, particularly if you're America and you reserve currency. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1538.88s)]
*  The only thing I would just say to balance this out, and I do think people are very positive on [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1544.16s)]
*  Paul Atkins. I've never met him, but the reaction from people who know him like Joe and who I [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1549.2s)]
*  respect has been very positive. It is important to remember we have the best capital markets in the [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1556.5600000000002s)]
*  world. The U.S. equity and fixed income markets are the most trusted places on earth. And we can [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1562.08s)]
*  always make them better, but just, it is very, you want to be very vigilant about keeping them fair [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1569.36s)]
*  and keeping out things like inside information, which makes people feel comfortable doing business [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1576.6399999999999s)]
*  here, having investors have confidence in a company's financial statements. And those [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1582.1599999999999s)]
*  financial markets are one reason America is such a great country. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1588.16s)]
*  And Gavin, to put this in context, this was during a time period, this David Marcus Libra process, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1591.44s)]
*  when they felt certain people in government, and I'm not saying I endorse this, but this is [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1598.8000000000002s)]
*  their position. Zuckerberg had too much power. Zuckerberg was censoring people. The right felt [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1604.48s)]
*  they were being censored. The left felt that Cambridge Analytica and people were using targeting [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1610.16s)]
*  adversely. The general vibe, and even JD Vance is kind of was in on this as well, was too much power, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1617.6000000000001s)]
*  specifically at Metta, too much influence. Now they've got this many people, this penetration, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1626.16s)]
*  and the algorithm, plus we're going to give them money. And they're going to have power over [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1632.24s)]
*  people's wallet. And then what does the government have? They can't censor people, they can't control [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1636.4s)]
*  the message, and they can't control the purse strings. That is the time period we're talking [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1641.6000000000001s)]
*  about here. I don't know, I understand 100% why they did it. I just think as an American, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1645.52s)]
*  at a minimum, the way that they did it was to use one of Joe's phrases, dishonorable. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1651.2s)]
*  If you want to say that we're going to kill this, then just like let's have a debate as a nation. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1658.8799999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. Don't do it in the shadows. Rule of law is also another reason America is a great [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1664.56s)]
*  country. Yes. Freberg, your thoughts on Dave Marcus's comments? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1671.36s)]
*  And this SEC pick, and just generally a more less regulation kind of situation. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1678.0s)]
*  I think the SEC is like one of the most important agencies we have. And I think they're one of the [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1685.6s)]
*  best federal agencies. So I've worked with them, and I've worked with any other agencies. And [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1691.4399999999998s)]
*  there's all these issues at the SEC, but they play a very important job. And if you've worked [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1696.1599999999999s)]
*  in foreign markets and you've dealt with foreign securities regulators, you're going to be like, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1702.08s)]
*  thank God for the SEC. You can't wait to go back. This whole crypto thing, there's a distinction, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1706.4799999999998s)]
*  I think, between Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as speculative assets, speculative trading. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1713.04s)]
*  What do you see those differences as? Well, I definitely concur with Gavin. I think [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1719.36s)]
*  Bitcoin fundamentally is meant to be supposed to be, ultimately will become a real threat to [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1723.9199999999998s)]
*  the US dollar. And it's kind of ironic that Trump had this declaration this week, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1729.28s)]
*  that he's going to put a hundred percent tariff on all these BRICS nations that try to participate [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1734.6399999999999s)]
*  in an alternative currency to the US dollar, the greatest currency on earth. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1739.52s)]
*  When he literally turns around and then says, we're going to support Bitcoin, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1743.2s)]
*  it felt like the biggest irony of the week to me, because I do think Bitcoin is the big threat [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1746.48s)]
*  to the US dollar. And I do think that at some point, whether it's this administration or the [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1751.28s)]
*  next, they're going to wake up to that fact. And maybe the Bitcoin does, the network state concept [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1756.32s)]
*  does emerge and that's where we end up. But I do think we want to have and are going to have a [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1761.52s)]
*  strong federal government in the United States for quite some time. That's going to play an [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1765.6799999999998s)]
*  important role in everyone's lives here. And I don't know if you can really just say, let the [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1769.28s)]
*  dollar be supplanted by Bitcoin. Bitcoin seems to be more of a safe haven asset and that seems to be [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1773.2s)]
*  the trade that it's store of value and alternative. It's just going to take over gold. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1779.04s)]
*  What do you think, Joe? You think the state has reasonable concerns about crypto competing with it? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1784.8000000000002s)]
*  And then maybe specifically, when you saw Trump talking about, hey, congratulations on your Bitcoin, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1792.0800000000002s)]
*  I did this for you on 100K and taking credit for it at the same, which he should take credit for it. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1797.1200000000001s)]
*  He did it. He did that last $40,000 per coin. And then you see him talking about the BRICS [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1802.0800000000002s)]
*  and then we have the US currency. So which is a bigger threat to American [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1808.16s)]
*  exceptionalism and supremacy on planet Earth, Bitcoin or BRICS? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1813.68s)]
*  So one represents a move towards liberty and one represents a move towards authoritarianism. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1819.2s)]
*  If BRICS were to become dominant, if China and Russia were able to control global currency [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1823.5200000000002s)]
*  together and other players, that is terrible. It's bad for the US for so many reasons, bad for US [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1828.48s)]
*  consumer for so many reasons. He's right to fight it. At the same time, having to channel biology, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1833.68s)]
*  having this pro-liberty network state forces in that direction. For example, I think rather than [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1839.1999999999998s)]
*  Hong Kong and Singapore, Hong Kong has been lost. We should have more Hong Kong and Singapore in [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1845.04s)]
*  the West to compete with the US. That'd be good for all of us who are on the pro-freedom side of [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1848.56s)]
*  the US and make the US wealthier. We'd show examples of new experiments that create great wealth. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1852.3999999999999s)]
*  And then that's the side of Bitcoin is you want more experiments and competition from the liberty [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1857.1999999999998s)]
*  distributed side. You don't want competition from the authoritarian side. So to me, it was very [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1861.36s)]
*  consistent. Yeah. Well, I would just say Texas is the Singapore of America. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1864.9599999999998s)]
*  And it is putting pressure on the rest of America. And I don't say that just because I grew up in [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1869.2s)]
*  Texas. It's just a fact. I do think long-term Bitcoin, I do not think the BRICS will ever be [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1873.0400000000002s)]
*  able to replace the dollar. There's rule of law, even if it has occasionally been corrupted in [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1880.88s)]
*  America, is very, very powerful. Yes. As opposed to rule by law. But I do think Bitcoin [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1887.68s)]
*  will at some point be a serious threat to the US dollar. And that just is what it is. And we'll [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1895.2s)]
*  see how different administrations react. What would that? It's a check on the most aggressive [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1903.44s)]
*  mistakes. First of all, if the debt doesn't get under control, if our deficit is ridiculous, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1908.48s)]
*  Bitcoin is a wonderful check on that. You actually want healthy competition from something good [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1912.48s)]
*  because you want to check the excesses and the craziness. You need someone coming from the outside [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1916.56s)]
*  to say, no, don't do that. Let's just say at some point an AOC-like person gets in charge. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1920.88s)]
*  It could happen in the next 20 years. You need some kind of check on the dollar. And it's much [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1925.3600000000001s)]
*  better to come from the Liberty side than from the other side. I agree with all of that. I will just [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1929.1200000000001s)]
*  say on AOC, I thought it was very interesting. I think if you're a Democrat, I think you're probably [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1933.1200000000001s)]
*  largely heartened by the intellectual leaders of that party, their reaction to losing. It's focused [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1938.0s)]
*  around, hey, we do need to deregulate. It is too hard to build. Josh Shapiro has been tweeting every [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1944.88s)]
*  three days about how he's making it easier to do business in Pennsylvania. It used to take 20 days [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1949.52s)]
*  to get a hairdresser license. That takes an hour. All that is good. But I actually thought AOC, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1955.36s)]
*  who is a very talented politician. She's an extraordinary communicator. She's an [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1962.16s)]
*  extraordinary communicator. Her reaction was like, she posted this on Instagram, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1966.08s)]
*  if you voted for Trump, I want to hear why. I want to hear the things you listen to that convinced [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1971.44s)]
*  you. Like, I don't say this out of anything other than genuine curiosity. Basically, clearly I am [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1977.68s)]
*  missing something and I, you know, I want to listen. And I just thought that was a very [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1983.76s)]
*  interesting reaction. That is the proper reaction. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I want to point out one [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1988.4s)]
*  thing I did. I was doing some research before the show and I found this SEC speech. This is a really [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=1993.6000000000001s)]
*  fascinating. This is from 2007 from Paul. And he was kind of giving his State of the Union here. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2000.5600000000002s)]
*  And he's talking about doing some self reflection. And he's talking about accreditation rules in 2007 [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2007.04s)]
*  before the great financial crisis. The concept of economic risk and return also affect a different [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2014.6399999999999s)]
*  proposal of the commission, the SEC. Relating to private investment funds, specifically part [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2020.48s)]
*  of the commission's proposal proposal would add an additional requirement for any natural accredited [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2025.84s)]
*  person to have at least 2.5 million investments before he or she could invest in private investment [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2030.8799999999999s)]
*  in a private investment fund like a hedge fund, or private equity fund other than a venture capital [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2036.16s)]
*  fund. The underlying premise for the commission's proposal is that these types of investments are [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2040.8000000000002s)]
*  too risky for individuals other than the very rich. Therefore, we would have to presume that the non [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2044.96s)]
*  richer either unsophisticated or lack access to sophistication. And it is simply not tolerable to [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2049.76s)]
*  have these types of people at risk of losing their money on a hedge fund. Assuming that these premises [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2055.2000000000003s)]
*  are true. However, what evidence does the commission have to support the conclusion that private [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2060.56s)]
*  investment funds are the most risky? What makes a hedge fund or a private equity fund more risky [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2064.48s)]
*  than a venture capital fund? Great question. And how does the risk profile of a pooled investment [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2069.6s)]
*  compare with the risks of investing in securities of a single issuer for which this new 2.5 million [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2075.12s)]
*  standard is? This is where it gets super interesting. Many public comment letters express [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2080.16s)]
*  indignation at the commission's proposal. One commentary wrote stay out of my wallet, stop trying [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2084.56s)]
*  to protect me from myself. Stop presuming to know more than I do about my own life, risk tolerance [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2089.2s)]
*  and financial sophistication. The commission's proval may very well prevent the non rich from [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2095.3599999999997s)]
*  losing their money in private investment funds, but it also certainly will prevent the non rich [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2100.0s)]
*  from participating in any upside profits and gains on these funds. Does this mean the rich get richer [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2104.24s)]
*  while the non rich should be content to just hold their place on the economic ladder? This to me, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2109.6s)]
*  when I saw this, I was like, you know what, I am feeling absolutely fantastic about Trump. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2115.28s)]
*  If he stops these wars, or stops one out of two and keeps us out of, you know, participating, even [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2121.36s)]
*  though we're not on the ground with the other any new ones, and he removes regulations, and we have [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2126.96s)]
*  people in power who understand that moving up the socio economic ladder is as important as protecting [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2132.2400000000002s)]
*  the downside risk, especially when we see wealth polarization. This is a great pick. Now the other [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2138.3199999999997s)]
*  picks, there's some whack pack picks in there. I'll be totally honest. I don't know what the [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2146.08s)]
*  strategy is, Joe, I'll ask you that in a minute. But what do we think, Gavin, of this sort of [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2149.8399999999997s)]
*  approach here, which is really thinking thoughtfully about what is sophisticated? And [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2156.0s)]
*  what are we doing here? What is the outcome we're looking for? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2161.9199999999996s)]
*  And no, I think it's great. And you could just, I mean, the reality is a hedge fund that runs with [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2165.52s)]
*  a lot of leverage probably is more risky. I don't know that it's more risky than a single security. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2169.52s)]
*  But like, at the end of the day, since he wrote that letter, it was an incredible 15 year run for [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2175.36s)]
*  private equity. And, you know, now all the big private equity firms are making a huge effort. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2182.88s)]
*  Now, probably the business is more mature, and maybe the return opportunities aren't what they [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2190.16s)]
*  were to appeal to Main Street America. Like, it would have been cool if, you know, Blackstone or [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2195.04s)]
*  KKR or whoever in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, you know, could have had their fund up on like the [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2201.04s)]
*  Fidelity marketplace for subscription. That probably would have been good for America. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2208.7999999999997s)]
*  So I think his comments are well taken. Imagine if Elon could raise for SpaceX, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2213.52s)]
*  like, you know, from regular Americans, I'm sure he would have loved to do that if it wasn't crazy [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2217.6s)]
*  risky with the SEC, right? So there's all these people, or just are blocking us from letting the [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2221.2s)]
*  average person be part of it. It does keep them from climbing a well flatter. I think it's crazy. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2224.72s)]
*  Yeah. A free break. Any thoughts here? I mean, this has been my pet peeve for a long time is [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2229.04s)]
*  letting people do what they want with their money. If you don't allow people to take risk [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2233.44s)]
*  with their money and move up from poor to middle class, from middle class to upper middle class, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2238.24s)]
*  and maybe eventually becoming affluent. Jason, there's a lot of places people [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2242.08s)]
*  can invest their money. They can buy public stocks. There's $20 trillion of public stocks [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2245.28s)]
*  they can buy. I don't think that you're prohibiting people from transitioning their wealth like bands [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2249.44s)]
*  by not being able to buy private stocks. In fact, I think it's more likely than not that people are [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2253.92s)]
*  going to go market bullsh** securities in private markets and rip poor people off even worse. And [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2258.2400000000002s)]
*  that's why there are these regulatory kind of barriers. And I don't think that it's necessary. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2263.52s)]
*  Everyone says, let's make it everything free and everything libertarian seems like a good idea. And [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2268.2400000000002s)]
*  someone gets punched in the face, gets ripped off, someone dies from a drug that's not properly [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2272.7999999999997s)]
*  tested. And then we're all like, where are the regulators? Where are the agencies to protect the [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2277.92s)]
*  individuals? And I think that's the role that these agencies are kind of providing. And that's the [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2282.0s)]
*  reason these rules are in place. I don't think that this is like one of these things where, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2286.56s)]
*  oh, liberty is being denied. I think there's a careful line to walk. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2290.0s)]
*  I'm generally pretty centrist in most things. So I agree with what a lot of David said. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2296.4s)]
*  And I do think if you were to allow ordinary Americans to buy private companies that are held [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2301.76s)]
*  to a lower standard of disclosure and reporting to public companies, like something would have to [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2307.84s)]
*  change. Like, you know, just, Hey, if, if a private company wants to like public companies are, you [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2312.6400000000003s)]
*  know, are held to certain standards for a reason. The numbers and financials and yeah. And there is [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2320.32s)]
*  a lot of fraud in venture. There are unethical people. There are. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2326.88s)]
*  And smart, diligent people can't even find it all. You know, that's it's like the most diligent [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2332.08s)]
*  people are still getting ripped off. Yeah. I mean, look at FTX. I mean, I mean, FTX ripped off some [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2337.2000000000003s)]
*  very, very intelligent friends of ours. Did any diligence at FTX? Yeah. But which is an important [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2342.6400000000003s)]
*  part of this. But I mean, if you had a sophistication, I mean, there's such an easy [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2349.6800000000003s)]
*  solution to this. You just do a sophistication test. People take a five hour course and they [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2353.04s)]
*  answer 50 questions. The end like a driver's license. Well, I do think it is a little, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2357.52s)]
*  that's why I talked about private equity. These are extremely sophisticated institutions who are [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2362.32s)]
*  always investing alongside their clients. Yep. And they're buying established businesses. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2366.88s)]
*  They're putting leverage on them. But like, I think private equity is kind of a middle ground [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2371.7599999999998s)]
*  and on a pooled basis. I think you could argue and you know, maybe those funds would need to [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2377.2s)]
*  change their reporting and their disclosures to deal with kind of the average American. But [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2382.72s)]
*  by that, I mean, strengthen it. But I think private equity, his comments were well taken. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2389.04s)]
*  That's what I would say. Joe, what are your thoughts? Yeah. I mean, I think the elephant [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2396.48s)]
*  going around the horn here, the elephant in the room that's really funny here is that you have [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2399.4399999999996s)]
*  the people on the left saying the only people with lots of money are smart enough to be allowed to [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2402.9599999999996s)]
*  do this, which I think is just a very funny position to take. And you just like, yeah, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2407.12s)]
*  you have to have a few million dollars to be sophisticated enough to be allowed to do this. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2410.56s)]
*  I like your idea, Jake, all the tests like there should be some other way of accessing this if you [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2414.48s)]
*  really want to. I agree. I agree. Listen, I don't want to live in a world where we're all constantly [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2418.96s)]
*  being spammed to the average person by like stupid financials stuff that's just like, we would be [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2423.2799999999997s)]
*  scammed all the time. There probably should be some rules. Like I agree. I'm not like a total [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2427.7599999999998s)]
*  libertarian on this. I think it'd be really annoying. But yeah, but just to totally block [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2431.84s)]
*  people from participating to me, that sounds crazy. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2435.28s)]
*  All right. I mean, as finance college professor, you know, might, unless they had another job, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2438.32s)]
*  might not, you know, be able to do this. They would have to make 250,000 dollars. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2445.6000000000004s)]
*  Let's talk about a very important public market set of transactions. Gavin, I'd like your point [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2450.96s)]
*  of view on Michael Saylor's convertible note issuances being used to buy Bitcoin. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2458.1600000000003s)]
*  Which this morning, this morning Bloomberg reported is the hottest trade in hedge funds right now. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2463.52s)]
*  Nick, if you could pull up the article and then Jake, I know you've been an outspoken [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2470.96s)]
*  opinion setter on Michael Saylor's promotion of his securities actions. We'd love your point of view, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2475.92s)]
*  Gavin. At some point, this does get too big for a while when it was smaller. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2481.92s)]
*  You know, you could support the debt. Sorry, could you explain it? Could you explain it to everyone, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2487.92s)]
*  Gavin? Yeah. So what he is doing is issuing debt and buying Bitcoin with the premise that Bitcoin [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2491.36s)]
*  is always going to go up. And he, you know, has made eloquent arguments why, why that is the case. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2497.1200000000003s)]
*  No trees grow to the sky. And I think the interest expense on his convertible notes [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2505.92s)]
*  is 75 million off the top of my head. And by the way, I am, I could care less about micro strategy, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2513.6s)]
*  like I'm not close to it. I'm not involved. Yeah. I don't know any hedge funds who own it. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2519.84s)]
*  No horse in the race. Yeah. Yeah. I think a lot of hedge funds are short micro strategy, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2525.92s)]
*  but I have no horse in the race. But the, but he's the underlying business [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2531.36s)]
*  that, you know, pays the interest expense on the debt only does $400 million a year in revenue. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2537.76s)]
*  And it's, you know, high gross margin revenue. But I just, unless debt investors [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2544.96s)]
*  have absolute confidence in Bitcoin has collateral. And I don't think that's where fixed income [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2553.6s)]
*  markets are yet. He, it will get to a point where it is, it is too big for the size of his company. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2559.84s)]
*  And then, yeah, maybe he can over collateralize it and, you know, have $10 in Bitcoin for every [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2569.04s)]
*  dollar of debt. But then like the, the magic money creation machine that, you know, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2574.0s)]
*  I see discussed on X breaks down because that's like, you know, that's, um, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2581.28s)]
*  that's very, very different than what is being discussed today. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2588.88s)]
*  Joe, do you have a point of view? Cause I, Joe's got to run by the way. So Joe, you want to close [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2592.4s)]
*  us out with the point of defense people down here in LA. Listen, I am very bullish Bitcoin. I loved [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2596.0s)]
*  all the energy of our society around it. I agree with what you said, Dave, that there's like, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2601.04s)]
*  there needs to be some barriers for the public taking crazy risks. And I think the risks around [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2606.32s)]
*  how he's accessing this is actually very unusual and does scare me a bit. And people need to do [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2610.32s)]
*  their research and they shouldn't just like throw money without studying it. It does scare me a [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2614.8s)]
*  little bit how likely people are throwing money at this without knowing the kind of leverage he's [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2618.32s)]
*  taking, you know? Yeah. Joe, anything else you want to share that you're up to that you're excited [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2622.56s)]
*  about before you head out? Well, you know, I, this, this weekend is the annual defense form at the [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2626.8s)]
*  Reagan library room on the board. It's the biggest, biggest defense event of the year. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2632.4s)]
*  Everyone's coming in. I guess, I guess I'm really excited that America has like woken up [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2635.76s)]
*  and assuming we can bring back more advanced manufacturing here. I think there's enough top [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2640.5600000000004s)]
*  companies now with Andrew, with Serana, we're going to be building thousands of these vessels [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2644.48s)]
*  for the Navy, with AI, with EPRS. We're like turning things off, you know, 10 miles away, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2648.2400000000002s)]
*  whatever, fairly far with microwave radiation. It's a really cool technology coming that [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2652.8s)]
*  actually is going to make us be able to deter our enemies. So if you asked me six, seven years ago, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2656.4s)]
*  I was panicked. We were going to like get way behind China. I'm feeling really good about it [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2659.6s)]
*  now. I think, and I think, I think, you know, just the Pete Haigstaff pick, you know, is actually [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2663.2000000000003s)]
*  someone I'm quite bullish on from everything I'm hearing. So I think things are going in the right [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2668.56s)]
*  direction. Is there a wholesale upgrade happening in defense in the United States? Are all systems [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2671.44s)]
*  and all strategies being rethought right now using technology and innovation and kind of a [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2677.36s)]
*  performance based product mindset leading kind of a reinvention of everything? Is that what's [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2683.36s)]
*  going to happen? Warfare is fundamentally totally shifted. We're seeing some of this in Ukraine. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2689.84s)]
*  There's all sorts of new ways you want to swarm things on the land, swarm things in the water, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2694.7200000000003s)]
*  swarm things in the air. How do they coordinate? How do they work together? How do you manufacture [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2698.2400000000002s)]
*  enough of these things and how do you use electronic warfare and new ways to, you know, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2702.56s)]
*  that's basically created by this. And so that is just a whole new way of doing things. And we are [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2706.48s)]
*  going that direction. Too much of the money, David, like 95% of the money is still going towards, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2710.72s)]
*  like, frankly, like wasteful legacy, like mostly things we don't need. But enough is shifting and [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2715.2799999999997s)]
*  there's enough good people fighting. And as long as we keep just allowing open competition, allow [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2722.8799999999997s)]
*  it to say, okay, which is better and just let the best things win. As long as we keep doing that, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2727.12s)]
*  I think it's going the right way. I'm feeling very good about it. Is the Chinese position shift [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2730.72s)]
*  in their technology strategy and their system strategy going to motivate a shift here? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2736.56s)]
*  Do you think it already has under way? It already has. I mean, it definitely. So we don't, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2740.48s)]
*  we don't need big aircraft carriers. We don't need F-35 drones. We need lasers. I think there's a role [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2744.7200000000003s)]
*  for carriers and force projection. I don't think we need like incrementally a ton more of them. I'm [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2751.12s)]
*  not, I'm not like this crazy radical where you get rid of all this, but yeah, on the margin, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2755.52s)]
*  I'd much rather have 10,000 more smart drones above and below the water than like an [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2759.6s)]
*  incremental carrier. Right. So there's, there's on the margin, there's all these things that [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2764.8s)]
*  are better uses of money. And I think we're pushing that way. And is there a huge tidal wave [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2767.84s)]
*  of venture money? I was at a dinner last night where there was this conversation about defense [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2771.92s)]
*  tech used to be off limits and a lot of LPAs say you can't invest in defense companies. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2776.2400000000002s)]
*  That's now changed or is changing and everyone's kind of coming up with their own [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2780.1600000000003s)]
*  defense tech strategy. Do you think, I mean, you were obviously early in this cabin. I don't know [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2784.08s)]
*  if you're an investor in this space, but are you guys seeing a big shift? Yeah. I obviously listen, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2787.76s)]
*  there's only been nine unicorns, I think still at this point. And I started three of them and [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2792.96s)]
*  invested three of them in the first round. So I'm obviously pretty involved in the space. And I [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2796.08s)]
*  think it helps me if there's more money for my companies, which is really great. I think there's [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2800.48s)]
*  probably the right answer for the U S it's not going to be like a thousand businesses or a hundred [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2806.24s)]
*  businesses. It's going to be, it's going to be like seven to 10 new primes. One of them's obviously [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2809.44s)]
*  under all, I think one is probably a seronic and Everest we'll see, but like there's going to be [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2813.84s)]
*  seven to 10 new primes and that's what's going to be. So there's going to be a lot of zeros and a [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2817.2s)]
*  lot of bad investments, but yes, these seven to 10 new primes are going to be huge. And if you can [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2820.72s)]
*  get access to them, you're going to do really well. Gavin, how do you look at that market? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2824.24s)]
*  You agree? I agree with everything. Joe said the only thing I would just add on China, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2828.3199999999997s)]
*  what we are doing by restricting their access to advanced compute and advanced networking. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2833.68s)]
*  If you have read or watched the three body problem, America is unfolding a sofa over China. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2841.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great way to say it. I have been really impressed with some of the Chinese models [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2847.7599999999998s)]
*  have come out. And I think the risk to this strategy is necessity is the mother of invention. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2853.7599999999998s)]
*  And despite this handicap, they're managing to stay just behind the leading edge of America, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2858.7999999999997s)]
*  which is amazing. But you know, Nvidia's Blackwell chip comes out next year. You're going to have new [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2864.72s)]
*  tips from AMD, new ASICs from Broadcom. And I think at that point, it is not going to be possible for [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2870.16s)]
*  them to keep up anymore. So that's actually positive regulation and great, in your mind, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2878.72s)]
*  foreign policy. It is very aggressive foreign policy. Yeah, clearly. You know, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2887.2s)]
*  that could have lots of unforeseen consequences. Yeah. What do you think about the rare earth trade [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2896.3199999999997s)]
*  restrictions coming to us? And is that going to actually affect this? We have lots of rare [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2901.7599999999998s)]
*  earth here in America. Like in America, we have everything in America. Like we, you know, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2906.64s)]
*  and I think there's a project underway to restart rare earth production. If there ever to be a [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2911.7599999999998s)]
*  conflict, all this stuff would go away. It's a cost and it's allowing us to do the refining here. So [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2916.56s)]
*  refining some of this stuff, like we desperately need gallium nitride for things I'm doing right [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2921.52s)]
*  with like shooting the microwave radiation. The problem is refining is really messy. If you let [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2926.0s)]
*  it happen in the US, it will still be messy, but it'll be cleaner. But we're not letting it happen. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2931.3599999999997s)]
*  There's things like this. So we're back to regulation and obviously the cost here is [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2935.12s)]
*  different. We have a different cost structure. You got to go meet 20 senators. So thank you. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2938.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. Thank you guys. This was fun. Good job. J Cal, do you want to talk about AI with [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2942.4s)]
*  Gavin and XAI? Yeah, I think that would be like a great next place to go would be to talk about [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2948.64s)]
*  the supercomputer being built by a friend of the pod, Elon. He's now got the world's largest [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2954.4s)]
*  computer and he's going to 10 exit according to reports. Yeah. And I would just say this is, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2960.64s)]
*  I think a very important moment for AI, you know, for this entire AI trade in the public [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2967.3599999999997s)]
*  and private markets. You know, everybody, I'm sure who watches your podcast is very aware of scaling [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2975.44s)]
*  loss. And we have not had that scaling loss for training, or if you 10x the amount of compute [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2982.24s)]
*  you train a model, you significantly improve the intelligence and capability of that model. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2987.52s)]
*  And often there are these, you know, kind of emergent properties that emerge alongside that [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2992.88s)]
*  higher IQ. No one thought it was possible to make more than 25,000, maybe 30,000, 32,000, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=2998.64s)]
*  pick a number, Nvidia hoppers coherent. And what coherent means is in a training cluster, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3008.16s)]
*  that each GPU to kind of simplify it knows what every other GPU is thinking. So every GPU in that [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3015.28s)]
*  30,000 cluster knows what the other 29,999 are thinking. And you need a lot of networking to [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3023.6000000000004s)]
*  make that happen. Enabled by InfiniBand, right? InfiniBand and I think even more importantly, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3030.0s)]
*  NVLink, although a lot of ethernet is, you know, never bet against the internet, never bet against [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3035.92s)]
*  the internet. Like if you read the Lama 3.1 technical paper, you got a lot of people excited [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3043.2s)]
*  about skinny link ethernet. But just to slow down for the audience here, Gavin, maybe explain why [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3048.7999999999997s)]
*  transporting information between the GPUs is important. And we're talking we get in the weeds [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3056.24s)]
*  here a little bit, everybody's heard of ethernet, but some of the other protocols and ways of moving [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3061.68s)]
*  stuff around large amounts of data. That's what these H 200s, 8200s do particularly well, they'll [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3066.16s)]
*  move a couple of terabytes a second from one processor to the next process. Yeah, so, you know, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3071.76s)]
*  picture a server. In the case of a GPU, it looks like maybe three pizza boxes stacked on top of [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3080.6400000000003s)]
*  each other. And it has eight GPUs together. And those eight GPUs are connected today with something [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3089.44s)]
*  called NVLink. You can think of the speed of communication on chip is the fastest tip to memory [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3097.04s)]
*  next fastest, you know, chip to chip within a server next fastest. And so you take those units [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3106.8s)]
*  of servers, which are connected, the GPUs are connected on the server with a technology called [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3114.96s)]
*  NVSwitch. And you stitch them together with either InfiniBand or [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3120.16s)]
*  ethernet into a giant cluster. And each GPU has to be connected to every other GPU [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3126.72s)]
*  and know what they're thinking they need to be coherent, they need to kind of share memory [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3134.48s)]
*  for the compute to work. The GPUs need to work together for AI. And no one thought it was possible [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3138.96s)]
*  to connect more than 30,000 of these with today's technology. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3149.8399999999997s)]
*  From public reports, Elon has he so often does focus deeply on this thought about it from first [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3155.3599999999997s)]
*  principles. How long it should take the way it should be done. And he came up with a very, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3163.3599999999997s)]
*  very different way of designing a data center. And he was able to make over 100,000 GPUs coherent. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3169.2799999999997s)]
*  No one thought it was possible. If I was I was a last minute ad for this. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3179.12s)]
*  But I would have said there are all these articles that were being published in the summer, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3186.96s)]
*  saying that no one believed he was going to be able to do it. It was hype. It was, you know, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3191.68s)]
*  ridiculousness. And that was coming. The reason the reporters felt comfortable writing those silly [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3197.2799999999997s)]
*  stories is because engineers at Metta and Google and other firms were saying, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3202.96s)]
*  we can't do it. There's no way he can do it. He did it. And I think the world really only [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3209.2s)]
*  believed it when, you know, Jensen did that podcast, I think with wasn't it with Gersener? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3216.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it was with Gersener and said, what Elon did was superhuman. No one else could have done it. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3224.2400000000002s)]
*  And I actually think you can argue that Elon doing that in a lot of ways kind of saved Nvidia [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3229.76s)]
*  from a tough six month period when Blackwell was delayed because everyone who was waiting for [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3236.0s)]
*  Blackwell and thought it was impossible to make 100,000 hoppers coherent, rushed out and bought a [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3241.44s)]
*  lot of hoppers to try and do it themselves. Now we will see if someone else is able to do it. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3247.04s)]
*  It was really, really hard. No one else thought it was possible. And [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3252.16s)]
*  as a result of that, GRUC3 is in trading now on this giant colossus supercomputer, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3260.48s)]
*  the biggest in the world, 100,000 GPUs. In Memphis, at the old Electrolux factory. And they're [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3266.3999999999996s)]
*  putting a lot of energy in there. A lot of natural gas, a lot of... [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3272.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, a dingy Electrolux factory with a lot of megapacks around it. And the city of Memphis is [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3276.08s)]
*  all in on supporting this, which is obviously smart for them. But you have not had a real test [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3283.36s)]
*  of scaling laws for training, arguably since GPT-4. And this will be the first test. And if scaling [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3289.44s)]
*  laws for training hold, GRUC3 should be a significant advance in the state of the art. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3296.0s)]
*  That is an immensely, you know, from like a Bayesian way to look at the world, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3300.88s)]
*  that is like an immensely important data point. But if that card doesn't work, and I think it is [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3308.4s)]
*  going to work, I think GRUC3 is going to be really good. I should note that I am... [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3316.4s)]
*  What with consumers? Yeah, you're involved. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3321.2000000000003s)]
*  My firm is an investor in XAI. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3323.36s)]
*  Got it. Yeah, they've raised a tremendous amount of capital, a lot of it from the Middle East, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3325.44s)]
*  and they're supposedly going to build Colossus to a million GPUs, is this data goal 10 times [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3329.52s)]
*  bigger than it is currently. There's been some debate back and forth, Freberg, about, hey, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3335.44s)]
*  are we hitting a wall here? Maybe you could explain the wall, either of you, to the audience. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3341.2s)]
*  Yeah. David? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3345.44s)]
*  Well, I'll let Gavin speak to the wall. I mean, Gavin, I think one of the questions also is, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3346.32s)]
*  you know, do we see an evolution if the kind of increment in performance relative to the investment [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3352.2400000000002s)]
*  in net kind of training, compute resources declines? Do we start to see a shift in [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3360.7200000000003s)]
*  how the architecture of the systems are run? Meaning, like, do we start to build models of [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3370.32s)]
*  models? And that starts to resolve a higher level architecture that unlocks new performative [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3375.68s)]
*  capabilities. I would just say we're already building models of models. Almost every application [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3382.0s)]
*  startup I'm aware of is chaining models. You start with a cheap model, you check the cheap models [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3387.8399999999997s)]
*  work with a more expensive model. Lots of very clever things are being done. Every AI application [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3392.16s)]
*  company has what's called a router, so they can swap out the underlying model if another one is [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3398.56s)]
*  better for the task at hand. As far as what the wall is, there's been a big debate that we were [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3403.2s)]
*  hitting a wall on these scaling laws and the scaling laws were breaking down. And I just thought that [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3411.12s)]
*  was deeply silly because no one had built a cluster bigger than, you know, 32,000 H100s. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3418.0s)]
*  And nobody knew. It was a ridiculous debate. And there were, you know, really smart people on both [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3425.68s)]
*  sides, but there is there there's no new data. GROK3 is the first new data point to support whether [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3432.48s)]
*  or not scaling laws are breaking or holding because no one else thought you could make 100,000 hoppers [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3439.6s)]
*  coherent. And I think based on public reports, they're going to 200,000 hoppers. And then the [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3444.96s)]
*  next tick is a million. It was reported they're going to be first in line for Blackwell. But [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3451.84s)]
*  GROK3 is a big card and will resolve this question of whether or not we're hitting a wall. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3456.72s)]
*  The other question you raise, David, is very interesting. And by the way, we should note there [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3464.0s)]
*  is now a new axis of scaling. Some people call it test time compute. Some people call it inference [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3468.16s)]
*  scaling. And basically the way this works, you just think of these models as human. The more you speak [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3473.9199999999996s)]
*  to one of these models, the way you'd speak to your like 17 year old going off to take the SAT, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3478.8799999999997s)]
*  the better it will do for you. As a human, you know, if I asked you, David, what's two plus two, [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3482.96s)]
*  four flashes in your mind right away. If I ask you to, you know, unify a grand unified theory [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3487.76s)]
*  of physics that accounts for both quantum mechanics and relativistic physics, you will [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3492.96s)]
*  think for a lot longer. We have been, nobody knows. We have been giving these models the same amount [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3497.12s)]
*  of time to think no matter how complicated the question was. What we've now learned is if you let [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3504.8s)]
*  them think for longer about more complex questions, test time compute, you can dramatically improve [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3510.24s)]
*  their IQ. So we're just at the beginning of this new scaling law. But I think the question you [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3515.68s)]
*  raise on ROI is very good. And I'm happy to address it. And there's a context window [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3521.12s)]
*  shift underway as well, which also creates a new kind of scaling access, arguably, in terms of the [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3529.6s)]
*  potential set of applications. So networks of models, think time, context window, there are [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3536.0s)]
*  multiple dimensions upon which these, these tools ultimately kind of resolve to better performance. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3542.96s)]
*  Oh yeah, we have even if scaling laws for training break, we have another decade of innovation ahead [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3549.76s)]
*  of us. Exactly. And, and, and as my understanding from speaking to folks, I'm certainly not as deep [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3555.04s)]
*  and well-versed as you, but there's a lot of effort and research going on in re-engineering [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3559.92s)]
*  various parts of the stack to reduce energy, to reduce every resource that effectively drives [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3565.44s)]
*  model performance, to basically re-engineer architecture. It was all like very brute force [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3572.16s)]
*  for a period of time. And it was like push, push, push. But now as we go back and we start to [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3576.64s)]
*  re-engineer and architect things in perhaps a more designed way, we get better performance. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3580.48s)]
*  And there's a lot of work to do there still. Absolutely. This is one of the great things [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3584.88s)]
*  about capitalism and a functioning capital market is you've got people working just on the context [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3588.96s)]
*  window for people who don't know what that is, is that's the number of tokens. A token is essentially [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3594.4s)]
*  a word. You can think of it, a piece of information, the number of tokens you can [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3598.8s)]
*  put into a conversation with a large language model. Some people have really large context [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3604.8s)]
*  windows and they have smaller ones, but you can basically put an entire book in the context window [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3609.44s)]
*  and start asking questions against the model. And the speed of those is critically important [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3613.12s)]
*  as well, because if you put the book in there and it takes you 10 minutes to get an answer, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3618.08s)]
*  that's not functional, right? Gavin, are you an investor in OpenAI? [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3620.96s)]
*  Oh, absolutely not. Yeah. Can you theorize on what the build out that's being done with Colossus does [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3625.28s)]
*  to the advantage that OpenAI has today? How long till we catch up there with XAI and [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3632.64s)]
*  how much is going to be disrupted and how quickly here? [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3639.44s)]
*  Well, if scaling was hold, [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3642.96s)]
*  the best information I have is the largest cluster Microsoft has after panicking. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3644.8799999999997s)]
*  It's still smaller than XAI's cluster in Memphis. If you didn't believe it was possible, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3650.16s)]
*  you weren't even working on it. Grok3 should take the lead if scaling laws hold in January or February. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3656.3199999999997s)]
*  I do think a lot of talent has left OpenAI. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3668.0s)]
*  I thought it was a really shocking statement from Mira Moradi that she resigned during a fundraise. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3671.04s)]
*  That's the only way she can express disapproval of what is going on there [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3680.3999999999996s)]
*  and still probably get her money. Right. So I think there's a lot of reasons if scaling laws hold [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3684.08s)]
*  to be to be a good investment. I think that's the only way to get the money. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3694.08s)]
*  If scaling laws hold to be to be optimistic about Grok3. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3698.56s)]
*  But I think, and then by the way, on the power question, and they are, you know, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3704.7200000000003s)]
*  23 and 24, it was just a panic to get GPUs and get them plugged in. Now we're, you know, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3710.0s)]
*  trying to make them efficient and thoughtful and to your point re-architecting them. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3715.92s)]
*  And the H200s now are 50% less power and either 50% more or twice as much [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3719.12s)]
*  compute, depending on the task. They have a little more compute and a lot more memory, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3725.28s)]
*  which really matters. So per kind of a unit of effective compute, they're a lot more power [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3729.28s)]
*  efficient. Two or three times, you think? Or no, the H200s, probably not, probably not 2X, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3734.4s)]
*  but a good increment. And the H100 was a great chip. And then 50% yeah. Yeah. Blackwell is just [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3742.2400000000002s)]
*  around the corner and that's an entirely new architecture with an entirely new set of networking [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3747.44s)]
*  technologies. What would consumers, if we had to sort of speculate here, what would consumers, [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3752.48s)]
*  how would consumers experiences change in using forward facing language models? And then maybe [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3757.36s)]
*  what are developers going to see on the backend, you know, in terms of what they're going to be [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3763.52s)]
*  able to build? If this pans out, you know, in the next two years. Right now you have like a friend [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3766.64s)]
*  in your pocket who has an IQ of 115, 110 maybe, but has all of the world's knowledge [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3774.0s)]
*  accessible to it. And that's what makes it amazing. I think this will be like you have a friend in [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3783.44s)]
*  your pocket, but, and they sometimes make things up. Again, they're very human and a lot of humans [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3788.08s)]
*  when they don't know the answer, they disassemble these AIs do it too. So you will have a friend in [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3793.84s)]
*  your pocket with an IQ of what maybe 130 that knows everything has more up-to-date knowledge of [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3800.96s)]
*  the world and is more grounded in factual accuracy. And it is interesting for any question involving [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3807.12s)]
*  real-time information, mostly sports and finance. You know, I always, you know, if there's a stock [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3817.6s)]
*  down 25%, ask every AI why is the stock down 25% generally Grok is the one that knows. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3822.8s)]
*  But I'm obviously biased. Yeah, no, no, no. Grok because of the Twitter data set, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3829.6s)]
*  exactly knows what is happening at the moment in the world today. All right. And then, you know, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3835.28s)]
*  as we sort of wrap up here on the AI issue, what about the ROI here that David was mentioning? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3841.04s)]
*  Yes. So the, I find these, these debates also very funny. You know, there have been articles [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3848.1600000000003s)]
*  written about the multi-hundred billion dollar ROI questions. Those are very strange to me [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3854.08s)]
*  because the biggest spenders on GPUs are public companies and they report financial results every [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3859.68s)]
*  quarter. And you can calculate a metric called return on invested capital. Yes. And ROI has [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3867.7599999999998s)]
*  gone vertical since they ramped their capex on GPUs and actually just starting to level out in [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3875.52s)]
*  this latest quarter. So the ROI on AI has been very positive thus far. Just a fact. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3881.6s)]
*  It's a really good question. Will it continue particularly if, you know, it's going to cost [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3887.7599999999998s)]
*  a hundred billion dollars to train a model in two or three years, which I think is a realistic [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3892.48s)]
*  estimate. I guess the counter to that isn't the counter to that, that maybe there's a little bit [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3897.36s)]
*  of hype that, you know, maybe there are people are trying to determine the ROI and correlated more [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3904.08s)]
*  precisely. And I guess that's the challenge, you know, meta doing AI across its entire enterprise. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3910.72s)]
*  You might see in Google, you might see it directly making ads more effective as an example. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3917.2s)]
*  A hundred percent. Yeah. That is the best ROI on AI. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3923.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. But then for other folks, like, you know, is it actually happening or is it a toy? I guess [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3926.72s)]
*  is the criticism I hear. I'm not saying that's my position, but that's the criticism I hear is like, [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3932.8799999999997s)]
*  are people actually getting money from the copilot or maybe this is just product market [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3936.64s)]
*  fit discovery process? Cause the, the AI laptops, AI intelligence on Apple and let's say some general [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3940.8799999999997s)]
*  LLMs people feel maybe aren't worth the money or copilot for Microsoft, maybe not worth the money. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3950.48s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I personally have not had good experiences with copilot, but I would say [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3955.68s)]
*  that, and I'm sure both of you have come across these, there are lots of companies that are just [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3959.76s)]
*  these thin wrappers over a foundation model and they go from zero to 40 million instantaneously. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3969.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And they're profitable. And for their customers, they're replacing labor budgets. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3976.4s)]
*  Yes. I'm sure you guys are noticing this too, but startups today at a given size are employing fewer [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3982.8s)]
*  people than they would have three years ago. And just like, you know, it's funny, people were very [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3988.96s)]
*  scared. I would say 50% less. Yeah. And that's the ROI on AI. And like, and you know, I went to the [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3992.88s)]
*  first AWS reinvent conference and no big companies were using cloud computing. It was all startups. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=3998.08s)]
*  Startups always adopt technologies first. So outside of the ROI on AI that you're seeing in [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4003.44s)]
*  Google and Meta from, you know, using this across their businesses, you're seeing real ROI on AI [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4009.44s)]
*  from startups the same way they saw real ROI from cloud computing before anyone else. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4015.84s)]
*  It's crazy. But I don't think these companies are in a classic prisoner's dilemma. They [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4020.08s)]
*  all believe to varying degrees that whoever gets there first to artificial super intelligence [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4026.2400000000002s)]
*  is going to create tens or hundreds of trillions of dollars in value. And I think they may be right. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4032.48s)]
*  And if they get there and they think that if they lose the race, their company is at mortal risk. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4037.36s)]
*  So as long as one person is spending, I think they will all spend even if the ROI decelerates. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4044.08s)]
*  It is a classic prisoner's dilemma. Competition is amazing. It really is. When you have a free [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4050.72s)]
*  market with competition, we're sitting here two years ago, three years ago on this pod, Gavin, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4055.9199999999996s)]
*  just lamenting like, oh my God, what can happen in China could just roll over us. They've got [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4060.16s)]
*  everything dialed in. We're a disaster. And now here we are. China is a disaster. They've got all [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4065.12s)]
*  kinds of challenges and the free market is even with weapons systems, we're seeing capitalism [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4069.92s)]
*  applied and competition applied there. All right. I think we should just wrap up on this [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4074.64s)]
*  Brian Thompson story. The CEO of United Healthcare was shot and killed outside of [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4078.56s)]
*  Manhattan Hotel on Wednesday morning. United Healthcare is an insurance subsidiary of United [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4082.2400000000002s)]
*  Health Group and they employ over 140,000 people. They provide coverage to millions. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4087.6s)]
*  And this was, I don't know if you've seen them, assuming you guys have seen the video on social [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4094.88s)]
*  media or go by on X. There's been a big debate. Was this like a really well-trained killer, [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4099.84s)]
*  like an assassin, like a hired gun? Was it something personal maybe? And this person's a [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4106.88s)]
*  hack and they're not really good at doing a hit like this. And most people are sort of coming [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4111.76s)]
*  somewhere in between. ABC has reported, and this is where this thing has taken like a crazy turn, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4116.56s)]
*  that the words deny, defend, and depose were discovered on the bullet casings at the scene. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4123.68s)]
*  And those are the terms. Two of the three are in a book about how health insurers reject many [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4130.56s)]
*  of the claims every year. They deny it, they defend it, and then they will depose people [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4138.08s)]
*  to harass them essentially. This is a crazy, crazy story and it's breaking here. I don't [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4141.68s)]
*  know if anybody has any insights on it, but I thought I would bring it up here [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4150.16s)]
*  to just maybe intelligently speculate about what we've seen. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4154.32s)]
*  I mean, it seems like the most likely case is someone's loved one died [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4158.56s)]
*  for they were denied coverage. And whether this person was hired or they're a victim or related [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4162.64s)]
*  to a victim, I don't know if it matters. I think there's... The observation I'll make [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4168.48s)]
*  is a question, which is, should CEOs be personally responsible for corporate actions, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4177.12s)]
*  generally speaking? So there's a difference between a CEO committing fraud or being negligent. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4185.280000000001s)]
*  But if you don't get a good service or good quality of service or the product you expect, [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4195.280000000001s)]
*  even if it is something you depend on for healthcare, for example, let's say you take a [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4201.280000000001s)]
*  drug and the drug causes a side effect that causes some permanent damage, should the CEO [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4208.8s)]
*  be individually held accountable? And if that were the case, would anyone want to be a CEO of [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4213.76s)]
*  a company that sets out to provide services that are critical like this? It's a very, I think, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4219.04s)]
*  challenging question to think about because certainly you could feel like you want to hold [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4225.280000000001s)]
*  someone responsible because a loved one died because that CEO's job was to make more money [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4230.24s)]
*  for their shareholders and therefore deny claims. And therefore the way that they run that business [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4236.4800000000005s)]
*  is wrong. I think ultimately we've got to kind of have this distinction between negligence, fraud, [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4241.68s)]
*  and acting on the corporate behalf. There's a... For a period of time, all of these documentaries [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4250.8s)]
*  and this movement against the idea of the corporation, generally speaking, you guys [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4257.68s)]
*  remember this was like a decade ago or 15 years ago. Anti-capitalism movements. Yeah. And it's [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4262.320000000001s)]
*  like the corporation shields individuals and the corporation creates a shield for individuals to do [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4267.84s)]
*  harm. It's kind of the argument that's made. And so there's a lot of people in this camp that think [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4275.2s)]
*  that these all CEOs of companies that let people down or evil should be killed, should be put in [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4280.400000000001s)]
*  jail, whatever the awful kind of contextualization of that is. And I do think it's really important [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4285.52s)]
*  to think about, well, if no one were to be the CEO because they faced that threat and those companies [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4291.76s)]
*  can't make money as a business, then those services go away entirely. That's kind of the [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4296.48s)]
*  end state of where this goes. There's going to be these difficult situations. If a CEO does something [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4300.48s)]
*  negligent, fraudulent, wrong, there's a court and there's a system and there should be laws that [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4305.839999999999s)]
*  protect people. I don't know, man. The whole thing is pretty depressing to think that a guy who's the [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4312.16s)]
*  CEO, he's... From what I heard- This guy's got a family. Yeah. I mean, he's got a family. He's got a wife. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4317.599999999999s)]
*  People that have known him said he was a nice guy and a good guy and he runs a tough business. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4322.8s)]
*  Insurance is a very tough business. Well, and to your point about this seems like it's very [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4328.24s)]
*  personalized with the casings, if that is in fact true. Again, this is breaking news, so we're [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4332.24s)]
*  speculating here, hopefully informed. This chart has been the one that's been circulating on social [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4336.72s)]
*  media. Now, this has now become, Gavin, like a raw shock test about how you feel about corporate [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4341.92s)]
*  America healthcare, et cetera, but UnitedHealthcare, at least according to these charts [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4347.92s)]
*  that are speculating, deny claims at a rate, at a multiple, two or three X other people in the [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4352.96s)]
*  industry and that they are the most hated. Not that any of this obviously results in somebody [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4360.8s)]
*  deserving to die. I mean, I can't believe I'm even saying this, but Taylor Lorenz was [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4366.64s)]
*  a woman who was, went viral with a series of tweets, not tweets, I think she's on [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4373.6s)]
*  whatever the blue thing is, sky blue, blue sky, where she wrote some quotes here. And people [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4381.04s)]
*  wonder why we want these executives dead. Lorenz wrote on blue sky and microblogging social [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4389.120000000001s)]
*  media site alongside an article about how blue sky, blue cross, blue shield no longer cover [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4393.92s)]
*  anesthesia for the full length surgeries. That's according to the New York Post. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4399.68s)]
*  Gavin, your thoughts on this insanity and tragedy? [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4406.08s)]
*  Yeah, well, first of all, it's a tragedy. It actually, I'm in New York as we record this and [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4409.04s)]
*  it happened one block from where I am. And I mean, it is absolute, it's a human tragedy. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4413.68s)]
*  Taylor Lorenz was not the only person on social media who reacted that way, which I thought was [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4424.72s)]
*  deeply troubling. It was a large group of people who are writing very morbid comments. There was [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4428.88s)]
*  a lot of anger around this issue that I was unaware of. I was completely unaware of it. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4434.400000000001s)]
*  Well, I think we all probably are very privileged to have great health care and able to pay our [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4441.92s)]
*  premium. So we're not affected by this at this stage in our lives. I was very affected by this [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4446.56s)]
*  30 years ago. We're all very lucky on this podcast. Yeah. And like, I can't imagine how I would [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4450.96s)]
*  feel if someone I loved had been denied medical care and died. And I felt like it was unnecessary [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4458.56s)]
*  and due to some corporation trying to make more money. But I just, I cannot believe, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4468.080000000001s)]
*  I'm sure I'd be outraged. I just can't believe. I was deeply disturbed as a person by the number [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4479.76s)]
*  of people online celebrating this. It's really crazy. Yeah. I thought it was awful. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4487.2s)]
*  And I guess the last thing I would just say about that chart is I think it is a little [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4496.5599999999995s)]
*  misleading. I think that is initial denial. You know, maybe the, you know, in other words, [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4499.599999999999s)]
*  maybe the company that, you know, only denies 7%, that's a final deny. You know, they, [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4506.4s)]
*  yeah, that's a company that, and who knows if the charts even correct. I bring it up only [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4510.8s)]
*  that it is the trending item. And people are, I find in these tragedies, they become like [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4515.6s)]
*  shock tests, right? Yeah. United healthcare's medical loss ratio is about 85%. So 85 cents of [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4521.120000000001s)]
*  every dollar they collect an insurance premium, they're paying out in claims. If you guys want [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4531.120000000001s)]
*  to look at what the most egregious insurance industry in the world is, it's title insurance. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4536.400000000001s)]
*  And I'll give you the list of the rest. Travel insurance is pretty bad. They pay out like nothing. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4540.8s)]
*  You were in the insurance business for a bit there. Yeah. Like I mean, you know, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4544.88s)]
*  health insurance is the hardest, one of the hardest, besides auto insurance businesses to be in. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4548.16s)]
*  You're paying out constantly. And there is a very difficult kind of process of managing losses [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4553.04s)]
*  because the number of claims that comes in, it's very easy to suddenly pay everything out. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4559.52s)]
*  And then your premium goes up and then people can't afford the health insurance. So you're [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4563.2s)]
*  striking this balance of making health insurance affordable against the costs of medical claims. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4566.88s)]
*  So it's a very kind of difficult business to be in. And I think it's very complicated to walk [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4571.68s)]
*  people through how they and their individual circumstances aren't necessarily motivated by [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4576.400000000001s)]
*  some corporate malfeasance. It's just the way the thing has to operate, unfortunately. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4582.8s)]
*  Let me just say, I think that they're much like we saw with Hamas [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4588.72s)]
*  and the attacks in Israel a year ago, there were people celebrating that behavior. And we've seen [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4593.68s)]
*  that several times since. And people have become very vocal about their celebration of what they [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4599.92s)]
*  view to be the death and harm done to those who they view to be oppressors in whatever context [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4604.8s)]
*  you want to kind of fit this to and put that oppressor label on an individual. And that [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4612.4800000000005s)]
*  mindset seems to hold true through any social, financial, economic, political context. There is [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4617.52s)]
*  an oppressor group and there's an oppressed group. And if you're in the oppressor group, [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4624.0s)]
*  you deserve harm. You deserve death. You deserve jail. And this is another manifestation of that [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4627.6s)]
*  mindset playing out. This is an individual with a family who ran a business, who worked very hard [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4633.6s)]
*  for many years and wasn't trying to hurt people. And for him to kind of have his life taken like [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4639.200000000001s)]
*  this and for people to say, that person is an oppressor, I think really speaks to how deeply [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4644.8s)]
*  people's minds have been contorted by this concept that there's oppressors and oppressed. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4650.320000000001s)]
*  It's almost like a mind virus. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4654.64s)]
*  And I'm not going to call it the woke mind virus, but because I just think you immediately shut [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4656.16s)]
*  down and won't hear that because it sounds cliche. But there is this concept of like everyone is in [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4660.16s)]
*  one of two groups. You're either being oppressed or you're an oppressor. And if you're an oppressor, [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4665.12s)]
*  there is no limit to what I should do or what should be done to you. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4669.12s)]
*  I think it's well said. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4671.5199999999995s)]
*  And it's a very stark and sad kind of commentary on what's going on right now. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4672.32s)]
*  And if you're oppressed, the corollary to that is if you are considered oppressed, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4677.36s)]
*  you can do no wrong. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4681.36s)]
*  You can do no wrong. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4682.24s)]
*  And that is, and obviously there are people who are oppressed on this planet, [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4684.0s)]
*  but they can still do wrong. They should still be held to a moral standard. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4689.28s)]
*  And there is a moral standard and there is a standard and murder, obviously, [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4694.96s)]
*  and assassination like this is not acceptable. And it's just tragic. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4698.32s)]
*  I just feel so terrible for this. These kids. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4703.52s)]
*  Let's end on a happy note. So we'll see you on Saturday. Big party. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4705.52s)]
*  Yeah, hard turn here, but looking forward to seeing everybody on Saturday for the [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4708.96s)]
*  Zoom is sponsoring the all in holiday. So if you want to go to all in.com, [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4714.0s)]
*  you can go sign up there. Right. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4719.12s)]
*  Free break. Yeah. And then you can sign up for the zoom. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4720.24s)]
*  Gavin, we expect you to sign up. Yes. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4724.24s)]
*  Have a caviar budget. We have to replenish over here at SACS. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4727.759999999999s)]
*  Do appreciate zoom helping us out for the zoom AI companion, help set up the live stream. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4730.639999999999s)]
*  So thanks to zoom for doing that. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4736.719999999999s)]
*  I have to say, you know what? One of the great experts, I have a couple of experience with the [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4738.0s)]
*  AI that are really great notion has a phenomenal AI built into it. And so does [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4742.72s)]
*  zoom with the AI summaries. I love getting these AI summaries of calls. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4749.76s)]
*  I ask people permission to turn it on and we got a summary and the bullet points really well done. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4753.280000000001s)]
*  I went to, we did a hackathon in the office a couple of weeks ago and we used, [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4757.4400000000005s)]
*  have you guys actually built applications with cursor? [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4761.52s)]
*  You guys have not, was it fun to build it? [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4764.72s)]
*  Well, it was great because we had so many people that have never built software applications. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4767.92s)]
*  In the hackathon and they built tools from scratch, deployed them in production [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4772.72s)]
*  and are now using them. And I think it really showcases the kind of the impressive impact [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4777.76s)]
*  that AI is having on workplace productivity. You don't need to buy SAS tools. You don't need [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4783.92s)]
*  to have service providers do stuff for you individuals. And by the way, it's only getting [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4787.84s)]
*  better and you can kind of be so important. The ability to just wake up in the morning [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4791.76s)]
*  and say, I want this app and have it built for you. And by the way, I'll just say it's, [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4795.52s)]
*  it's like 70, 80% there. You still have to debug. You still have to have someone come in and help [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4799.68s)]
*  kind of get things into production. So there's still a little bit of work. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4803.84s)]
*  Well, it's just like web pages, right? [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4806.08s)]
*  Going back to the, going back to the architecture question two months ago, and then go back to the [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4807.68s)]
*  architecture. 60% there now it's 70 to 80. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4812.4800000000005s)]
*  And you fast forward 12 months and now you've got the architecture where the AI can run its own QA [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4815.12s)]
*  testing and debugging and the AI can run its own kind of sales and marketing and it's own UX of [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4820.16s)]
*  the application and it can run everything. So you're basically going to say, I want this app to do [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4826.64s)]
*  this. It builds it, it tests it, it builds the UX, it tests the UX, it iterates the UX. It does [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4830.64s)]
*  everything streamlined for you. And then you show up a couple hours later and you're using a new [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4836.240000000001s)]
*  product that was built on the fly for you. It is, and we're literally like climbing this ladder, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4840.240000000001s)]
*  Gavin, like very quickly that it's going to totally change this entire software industry is like [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4846.320000000001s)]
*  getting re-architected. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4852.4800000000005s)]
*  I could guess Freeberg's app at his company hackathon. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4853.28s)]
*  What do you think I made? [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4856.32s)]
*  I made a vegan version of Yelp. Only profiles, all the vegan restaurants. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4857.679999999999s)]
*  I actually tried to make a CRM tool so that I wouldn't have to pay for CRM licenses. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4863.92s)]
*  I tried nine months ago to make a multiplayer. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4868.719999999999s)]
*  Shout out Mark Benioff. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4870.24s)]
*  Sorry, go ahead, Gavin. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4872.719999999999s)]
*  I tried nine months ago to make a multiplayer app for Skyrim, which I was very excited with Skyrim. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4873.92s)]
*  But I do think I failed. Maybe I should give it another go. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4881.92s)]
*  But the- [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4885.52s)]
*  You learned, you didn't fail. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4886.4s)]
*  I learned, I learned. I didn't fail. I learned. Yeah, I have a growth mindset. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4887.52s)]
*  We learned the limits. We all tested the limits. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4891.2s)]
*  But I think next year, the human language will be the dominant programming language. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4895.28s)]
*  Totally. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4900.24s)]

*  When you got a dollar and you got a lot of dollars, you're like, [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4926.0199999999995s)]
*  it's okay if I get a nickel out of a dollar. I got more dollars laying right over here. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&t=4928.74s)]
