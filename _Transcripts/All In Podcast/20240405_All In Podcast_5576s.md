# E173 Google buying HubSpot? FTX depositors not made whole, AI job fears, Ukraine joining NATO
**All In Podcast:** [April 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM)
*  All right, everybody. Welcome back to the all in podcasts, the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=0.0s)]
*  number one podcast in the world episode 173. It's objectively [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2.6s)]
*  freeburg the number one podcast I checked I looked online. And [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=8.4s)]
*  things are cooking over here. So much so that you may have [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=12.0s)]
*  heard we hired a new CEO. Welcome to the team. Our new [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=15.64s)]
*  fifth bestie john Hale. Yeah, clap everybody. Golf clap. Yes. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  All right, john, welcome to the program. Your first day was [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=27.64s)]
*  April 1. It wasn't a joke. Literally was your first day. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=30.96s)]
*  How has week one as CEO for all in been? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=34.68s)]
*  It has been wonderful, super dynamic, really happy to be a [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=40.44s)]
*  part of the team. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=43.96s)]
*  All right, there you have it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  Sachs, you were a huge driver of this. You spent so much time [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=48.160000000000004s)]
*  interviewing everybody going through the resumes checking [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=52.08s)]
*  the references. You know, and you really spearheaded this. Oh, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=55.28s)]
*  wait, you did nothing. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=58.6s)]
*  Sachs Sachs. It's spelled j o n john. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  Wait, who is this? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  Sachs is John. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=64.16s)]
*  Okay, you guys haven't met. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=70.44s)]
*  Love you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=85.68s)]
*  So john worked at the Russian embassy. This is just a [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=89.92s)]
*  coincidence that Russian references but he worked as an [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=92.48s)]
*  intern for Putin somehow he wound up getting the gig. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  Freeberg, you actually led the the the incredible search here. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=98.72s)]
*  We had hundreds of people apply. Why do you think we wound up [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=104.8s)]
*  with Mr. Hale here? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=109.28s)]
*  Yeah, we had a lot of folks and we met with a lot of folks. But [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=110.36s)]
*  John really stood out with I think his experience and his [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=112.84s)]
*  thoughtfulness about what we can do. So so much of our work off [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=117.16s)]
*  the show obviously has gone into putting on the all in summit and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=121.96s)]
*  we want to do more live events and john has a very strong [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=125.28s)]
*  background in building incredible live experiences and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=129.88s)]
*  events, which we think is going to be a really important [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=133.56s)]
*  extension. I think we've we realized over the last two [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  summits how much community matters for all in and how much [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=138.64s)]
*  getting people together matters and how much the live content [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=141.28s)]
*  mattered. And so we want to do more of that and hopefully john [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  can take us to the promised land. Fantastic john, thanks [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=147.44s)]
*  for thanks for saying yes. It's awesome to have Yeah. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=151.0s)]
*  Alright. And as john's first first duty he is going to next [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=153.64s)]
*  week, announce the details of the all in summit 2024 our third [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=158.76s)]
*  edition. Chairman dictator Chamath Palihappatiya. You've been [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=164.0s)]
*  running all in with an iron fist in the group chat. Your [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=167.84s)]
*  thoughts on john and working with him and why we selected [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=172.12s)]
*  the iron fist please go. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=177.2s)]
*  I think that there's a really important trend that we have [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=180.2s)]
*  stumbled into. Which is that content creators are the modern [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=186.88s)]
*  form of demand generation for whatever else it is that you're [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=193.56s)]
*  going to consume. And I think it replaces advertising and I think [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=198.16s)]
*  it displaces traditional content. And so I was really [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=201.6s)]
*  interested in finding somebody that understood how to connect [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=206.36s)]
*  those dots and all of the different ways in which we can [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  explore what our brand is capable of. And I thought he [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=213.12s)]
*  was the best example of having done one thing extremely well at [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=217.2s)]
*  scale. And curious enough to figure out the other parts. So [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=220.4s)]
*  you know, I'm really excited to work with john. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=225.24s)]
*  Yeah, and I'll just add to that, you know, I've been doing events [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=226.8s)]
*  my whole life. And when I saw john's actual event history and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=229.96s)]
*  the events you've thrown john, really spectacular in the detail. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  And I think you're gonna the same way freeburg leveled up [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  year two of the conference. I'm really excited to see how you [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=240.96s)]
*  put your stamp on it and level up year three. A couple of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=244.0s)]
*  housekeeping things here. You know, we are [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=246.72s)]
*  by the way, sorry, can I say one thing? Absolutely. Like you [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=248.88s)]
*  said, there is so much room to build real communities. And I [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=250.84s)]
*  think people are just so tired and bored with everything [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=256.96s)]
*  online. So I think offline experiences will be a huge value [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=262.6s)]
*  add in people's lives. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=268.92s)]
*  Yeah, there's definitely a bridge from online to offline. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=270.36s)]
*  And the all in meetups that Ray's been hosting the best the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=274.04s)]
*  best example, the best example of at scale of online to offline [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=278.12s)]
*  are dating apps. And all I can see is that's a pretty [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=283.48s)]
*  dissatisfying experience for a lot of people. And so outside of [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=287.12s)]
*  dating apps, there aren't many really great examples where [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=290.76s)]
*  like minded people can hang out and have fun and, you know, talk [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=293.56s)]
*  learn party. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=299.56s)]
*  It's really interesting you bring this up. I just finished [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=301.12s)]
*  John hates new book, the anxious generation. And if you've [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=304.0s)]
*  listened to it, but there's a pair of books out right now, bad [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=308.28000000000003s)]
*  therapy. And this one about kids. And the premise of this [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=310.84000000000003s)]
*  book, Shumoff is screen time, as you referred to, you know, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=314.88s)]
*  people being online. Not only is it bad for kids and adults, it's [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=319.08000000000004s)]
*  also blocking, to your point, real world connection. And so we [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  all want a little more real world connection. And so John, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  welcome to the team. Additionally, I'll just two more [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=331.32s)]
*  housekeeping items here and then we'll get to the show. We're [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=335.12s)]
*  gonna have a 1 million subscriber party. If you want [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=337.48s)]
*  to be part of that 1 million subscriber party, you can [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=339.68s)]
*  increase your chances. We're not announcing how we're going to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=342.08s)]
*  give the tickets away. But you can increase your chances by [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=344.36s)]
*  going to YouTube right now, pause the show, subscribe to [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=346.92s)]
*  the all in podcast channel, hit the bell. So you get the alert [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=349.8s)]
*  for the best chance at getting one of the golden tickets to [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=353.52s)]

*  Welcome to the program. A quick correction up top that many of [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=449.08s)]
*  you in the crypto space. Let us know about immediately after the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=452.96s)]
*  episode dropped. We talked about SPF getting 25 years. And that [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=457.24s)]
*  broke right as we started the show. And we discussed that the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=461.92s)]
*  customers of FTX we're going to get made whole. There's been a [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=465.8s)]
*  lot of speculation about them being made whole. However, there [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=468.0s)]
*  was an important note. FTX deposits are getting paid back [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=473.4s)]
*  in US dollars, not the crypto. That dollar amount we've learned [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=477.15999999999997s)]
*  is based on the price of their tokens at the bankruptcy date. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=481.59999999999997s)]
*  The bankruptcy date was November 11 in 2022. Super important [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=483.91999999999996s)]
*  because the report that started the run on FTX was published [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=488.79999999999995s)]
*  November 2. A couple of days in between those two dates, and a [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=492.91999999999996s)]
*  bunch of crypto plummeted. Solana dropped 50% between [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=496.91999999999996s)]
*  November 5 and November 11. That's just one example. But [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=500.76s)]
*  since then, Solana has been up 11x and bitcoins up 4x, Ethereum [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=503.8s)]
*  doubled. So if you wanted these depositors, you miss that run [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=508.52s)]
*  up. And so FTX customers were rightfully furious. I'll pause [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=512.48s)]
*  there before I get into more details. Any thoughts on this [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=517.2s)]
*  Sax? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=520.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, just to hit the nail on the head here. If you had [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=521.52s)]
*  left your Solana at FTX, you're going to get $16 per token [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=525.8s)]
*  back. And that apparently was the price at the time that they [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=530.72s)]
*  went under. So according to the judicial proceedings, you've [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=535.12s)]
*  been quote unquote made whole. But the truth is that Solana at [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=540.52s)]
*  this moment is trading at $188. So you have not been made whole. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=543.4s)]
*  And this is why the crypto community is furious. And so [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=547.48s)]
*  that basically is the correction. Now, I thought it [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=550.72s)]
*  was interesting that the judge played into this notion. And we [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=553.4s)]
*  talked about that quote from the judge last week where he said [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=557.64s)]
*  that if you go to Vegas, abscond with your customers money, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=560.9599999999999s)]
*  gamble it and then pay them off with the winnings, then you've [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=564.48s)]
*  still committed a crime. He seemed to be conceding this idea [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=568.28s)]
*  that the investors or the depositors at FTX have been [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=571.76s)]
*  made whole. Clearly they have not been but his quote kind of [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=574.88s)]
*  lent credence to that. And the reason the judge was talking [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=578.3199999999999s)]
*  about is because SPF lawyers were clearly making this [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=581.1999999999999s)]
*  argument that his sentence should be commuted or reduced [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=584.64s)]
*  because the depositors have been made whole. And I think what you [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=589.84s)]
*  saw in the media coverage is that the reporters were buying [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=593.2s)]
*  into this idea of depositors being made whole. I mean, you [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=596.36s)]
*  guys got this from somewhere, right? I mean, this is what the [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=600.44s)]
*  media coverage. So the media, the media was doing what has [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=603.12s)]
*  been doing throughout the FTX case, which is carrying water [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=607.0s)]
*  for SPF. And I believe that this narrative that they're trying to [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=610.52s)]
*  concoct, which we now know is completely false, is designed to [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=614.44s)]
*  serve a purpose. And I think that purpose is to get SPF [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=618.2800000000001s)]
*  either pardoned or have a sentence commuted. Because Mr. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=622.0400000000001s)]
*  Bankman and Ms. Fried are huge Democratic Party bundlers. And I [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=627.4000000000001s)]
*  think the goal here is to create the idea in the public's mind [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=631.4000000000001s)]
*  that people weren't really hurt by this. This was just sort of [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=635.72s)]
*  youthful indiscretion or hijinks. And, you know, as a bunch of [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=639.5600000000001s)]
*  hijinks, right? Shenanigans, but shenanigans where no one was [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=644.6800000000001s)]
*  really hurt. And if they can create that impression in the [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=648.24s)]
*  public's mind, they can now set up getting one of their [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=650.84s)]
*  Democratic Party connections to help push for a commutation of [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=654.6800000000001s)]
*  the sentence. I think there's a narrative going on. I think [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=659.32s)]
*  there's an agenda behind the narrative. And it's what I'm [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=661.48s)]
*  saying here. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=665.12s)]
*  Yeah, this pardon power is really powerful. Chamath, any [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=666.08s)]
*  thoughts here on the bankruptcy judge making that call to sell [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=668.72s)]
*  the shares? Because obviously, if crypto had tanked since that [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=673.2s)]
*  time, it would look like he saved the money by selling them [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=676.88s)]
*  clearing the positions and giving them cash. But what is [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=679.2s)]
*  the right thing for the bankruptcy judge to do here? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=681.6s)]
*  Keep the equities, the tokens or to sell it and freeze it in [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=684.84s)]
*  time? It seems like a very difficult. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=688.9200000000001s)]
*  Hold on, Jake, we got to correct that for just in a certain way. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=690.88s)]
*  So the trustee has been selling the tokens post run up. The point [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=694.16s)]
*  is that he's selling tokens at current prices, call it 188, and [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=699.5600000000001s)]
*  then using that to pay off depositors at $16. So the only [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=704.48s)]
*  reason the depositors have been quote unquote made whole is [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=709.04s)]
*  because they're getting the benefit of this run up, but [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=712.64s)]
*  they're not paying them back at the price of their Solana today. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=714.4s)]
*  They're paying them at this price that got fixed at the time [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=718.6s)]
*  of the bankruptcy. The truth is, this is why no one's getting [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=721.44s)]
*  made whole. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=725.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is the you know, the really hard thing to track here [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=726.44s)]
*  because we couldn't find when they were selling it or how much [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=729.24s)]
*  they've been selling this seems to be being done in the shadows [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=732.2s)]
*  or in the background. And so if anybody out there as we [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=735.6s)]
*  crowdsource what's going on here wants to keep us up to date, let [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=737.6800000000001s)]
*  us know. But yeah, these tokens, some number of them got sold at [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=742.2s)]
*  a low price, some of them are getting sold, I guess, as time [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=746.0s)]
*  goes on. Chamath, your just thoughts on how to do this [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=748.4s)]
*  properly? What's the proper hygiene here? I mean, it's [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=752.72s)]
*  we're not saying crazy experts. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=755.3199999999999s)]
*  That's a great question. I don't know the differences between [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=757.28s)]
*  chapter seven and chapter 11 bankruptcy law, but I don't know [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=760.8s)]
*  what was filed here was chapter seven or chapter 11. I don't I [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=765.16s)]
*  don't know. But it seems that this was the only thing that [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=768.8s)]
*  they could do, which was to liquidate into a common, you [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=773.76s)]
*  know, unit of measure. Because at the end of the day, their [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=777.44s)]
*  auditors had to measure in a standard unit, and that was [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=781.08s)]
*  probably the US dollar. And so then they were trying to work [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=785.5200000000001s)]
*  backwards from that shareholder equity number to get them back [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=788.2s)]
*  to that number. So yeah, it was kind of logical that that this [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=792.4000000000001s)]
*  is the only thing they could do. And I guess they benefited from [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=797.08s)]
*  the fact that there was a run up, but it's really [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=800.7600000000001s)]
*  unfortunate for folks. So I don't know, maybe in other [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=802.48s)]
*  countries, had this been a differently constituted company [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=805.16s)]
*  organized in a different place. Bankruptcy law could have [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=808.4s)]
*  allowed the liquidator to actually just distribute the [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=811.1999999999999s)]
*  assets on a pro rata basis. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=813.24s)]
*  This was a chapter. I don't think that would have helped [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=816.4s)]
*  that much. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=818.48s)]
*  This is a chapter 11. And in September, the judge allowed FTX [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=820.0s)]
*  to start liquidating up to 100 million a week. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=823.8399999999999s)]
*  In Delaware, right? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=826.3199999999999s)]
*  This is a chapter 11 Delaware file. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=827.36s)]
*  Yeah, chapter 11 in Delaware, correct. And this could increase [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=830.0s)]
*  to 200 million a week. So it seems like they did, they did [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=833.0s)]
*  start the liquidation later. So they might have caught some of [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=835.48s)]
*  the run up. So they did catch the run up, then you could be [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=838.12s)]
*  doubly upset, right? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=840.24s)]
*  My point, my point is in different in different [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=841.5600000000001s)]
*  situations, one could imagine where the shareholders could [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=844.0s)]
*  have been allowed to vote. Do you want money? Or do you want [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=847.8000000000001s)]
*  in kind? And if in kind, maybe you get a pro rata distribution [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=851.48s)]
*  of all the assets, which have included a whole bunch of these [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=855.6s)]
*  coins, but then it probably would have included a bunch of [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=858.6s)]
*  other assets, not just Solana and Bitcoin and ETH that ripped. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=861.4s)]
*  So [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=864.8399999999999s)]
*  I think the point is that if they had distributed in kind, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=865.4399999999999s)]
*  meaning tokens, that people would have seen, oh, wait, I [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=868.4s)]
*  only got back one tenth the number of tokens that I put in. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=871.68s)]
*  That's the point, right? Yeah, you put in 100 Solana tokens, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=874.6s)]
*  you only get back call it roughly 10, because the price [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=878.3199999999999s)]
*  of those tokens was fixed at 16. And they can now sell at [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=881.68s)]
*  somewhere between 100 and 200. They're able to quote, make you [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=885.48s)]
*  hold the $16 price, but that's not being made whole. That was [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=889.12s)]
*  the point of all that. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=892.0s)]
*  What are they doing with the extra money sacks? Because are [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=892.5200000000001s)]
*  they using that to make other people in this whole crater [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=894.88s)]
*  hole as well? So maybe they're thinking holistically, they're [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=898.1600000000001s)]
*  taking the profits of those Solana holders, let's say, or [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=900.48s)]
*  Bitcoin holders went for X. And is that going to trickle down [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=903.1600000000001s)]
*  to the equity holders? Who knows? Freeberg, you have [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=906.24s)]
*  thoughts? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=908.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think the plan is that that excess capital beyond what [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=910.2s)]
*  is quote, owed to the account holders goes to the equity [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=913.0400000000001s)]
*  holders, because it's considered equity holders. And so it's [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=915.96s)]
*  excess of the liabilities, therefore it goes to the [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=919.0s)]
*  shareholders. I'll also say in a traditional like brokerage, you [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=921.88s)]
*  create an account. And when you set up an account, your account [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=927.64s)]
*  has a currency denomination. It's a dollar based account or [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=930.72s)]
*  euro based account. And then you your account holds a bunch of [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=935.24s)]
*  assets. And so at any given time, the value of your account [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=938.96s)]
*  is represented to you in that local currency. The challenge [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=942.68s)]
*  with crypto exchanges is that there's often this representation [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=946.68s)]
*  of a wallet, which is meant to hold assets that don't [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=949.5999999999999s)]
*  necessarily have the intention of being translated into a [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=952.28s)]
*  locally denominated currency. And so I think that's what makes [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=955.5999999999999s)]
*  the system different in the case of a US exchange bankruptcy. And [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=958.9s)]
*  this happens in commodity trading accounts or commodity [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=962.0s)]
*  exchanges. Often, there's a freezing of the assets and then [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=964.56s)]
*  a liquidation of the assets, where the freezing of the assets [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=967.5999999999999s)]
*  sets the price or the value at the moment of what you're [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=970.8s)]
*  supposed to hold in that account in your currency of [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=974.08s)]
*  your account. And so the bankruptcy judge and the trustee [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=977.1600000000001s)]
*  are treating this like a liquidation process using a [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=981.48s)]
*  local currency that was set at the time, whereas many folks [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=984.64s)]
*  don't consider that the intention of the account that [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=989.44s)]
*  the account was meant to hold assets, that it's really a [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=991.8000000000001s)]
*  portfolio of assets that shouldn't be liquidated to try [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=994.6s)]
*  and generate local currency, because that's kind of the whole [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=998.08s)]
*  point of many of these crypto currencies themselves. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=999.9200000000001s)]
*  It was a custodial account, basically. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1003.6s)]
*  Right, a custodial account of assets versus a trading account [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1006.24s)]
*  of which is meant to ultimately be converted back into a local [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1010.5600000000001s)]
*  currency, which is typical. And I think that's what makes this [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1014.04s)]
*  such a challenging process. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1017.76s)]
*  Yeah, just liquidate everything. Pull of money arrives, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1020.04s)]
*  distribute the money. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1023.48s)]
*  But the way bankruptcy works is that there's a pecking order [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1024.76s)]
*  that essentially you you have all the assets to the company, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1029.6s)]
*  the job of the trustee is to liquidate them, they have a [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1032.6s)]
*  fiduciary duty to get the highest price they can for those [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1035.1599999999999s)]
*  assets. We have no reason to believe that they haven't, they [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1037.7199999999998s)]
*  seem to have waited a decent enough amount of time to get to [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1040.48s)]
*  benefit from this crypto recovery. And then what happens [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1043.6799999999998s)]
*  is, again, there's like a pecking order for the [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1046.7199999999998s)]
*  distribution of the proceeds. And you're going to have debt [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1048.52s)]
*  holders, they're going to be senior to the equity holders, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1051.9199999999998s)]
*  the depositors are going to be high up there as well. Government [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1054.76s)]
*  agencies that are owed fines are going to be high up there. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1059.0s)]
*  There's gonna be a very specific pecking order in which the [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1061.48s)]
*  equity holders are last. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1063.76s)]
*  If we want to go into conspiracy corner and put our tinfoil hats [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1065.0s)]
*  on, you mentioned the IRS, the CFTC, right? These government [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1067.3200000000002s)]
*  agencies are owned like over $20 billion. If all this crypto [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1071.6000000000001s)]
*  profits, if they're higher in the stack, they would be going [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1076.4s)]
*  directly to the government and the government is handling the [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1079.4s)]
*  process here. So it doesn't look right. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1081.48s)]
*  But I don't think I don't think it's that's driving it. I think [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1083.1200000000001s)]
*  that I think bankruptcy rules are very specific, and they're [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1086.16s)]
*  completely designed around, again, assessing what the value [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1089.84s)]
*  of each claimant is at the time of bankruptcy and then creating a [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1096.9599999999998s)]
*  pecking order for distribution. So I don't think there's any [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1100.6s)]
*  foul play here. I think that this is just the way that the [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1104.36s)]
*  cookie crumbles. But I think that it's simply wrong, or [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1107.36s)]
*  misleading to say that the depositors were made whole. And [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1112.1599999999999s)]
*  I think the reason we thought that is because of these [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1115.48s)]
*  statements that were promulgated through the media, including the [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1119.88s)]
*  judge to give people that impression. And I think it [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1123.4s)]
*  really just underscores that the media always has an agenda. And [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1126.84s)]
*  you got to be so careful about imbibing their narratives, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1130.4s)]
*  because without knowing exactly what their agenda is, you can [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1134.56s)]
*  imbibe their bias. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1138.88s)]
*  Yeah, my understanding bankruptcy is like they can get a [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1140.68s)]
*  little bit creative and the bankruptcy judges can be a [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1143.76s)]
*  little creative and trying to holistically think about what's [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1146.96s)]
*  the best thing for the business and all the stakeholders, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1149.8s)]
*  shareholders, but anyway, we'll keep monitoring it. And like [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1151.84s)]
*  we've said before, anytime we make a mistake, we're going to [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1155.68s)]
*  talk about it right up front. Anytime there's an omission or [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1157.92s)]
*  breaking news happens, we're going to fill you in. And that [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1161.16s)]
*  leads us to our second topic, some more news broke about truth [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1164.44s)]
*  social, we had a nice spicy discussion about it last week. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1167.32s)]
*  Since that time, shares of TMTG, or dollar sign DJT have dropped [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1170.52s)]
*  30%. And the numbers for their revenue also confirmed it came [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1176.9199999999998s)]
*  out pretty ugly, 4 million in revenue, 5 million losses, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1182.08s)]
*  floats only 30 million shares. But there are some follow up [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1185.32s)]
*  stories here we'll get into Trump is suing the two [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1188.8s)]
*  co founders to reduce their combined 8.6 state to zero. His [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1191.12s)]

*  mishandled the launch of truth social so they should forfeit [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1196.9199999999998s)]
*  their stock. These are both co founders previously on the [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1199.44s)]
*  apprentice. Trump owns 60%. And he stands receiving an amount of [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1202.2s)]
*  36 million additional shares in the coming week, worth almost [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1206.8s)]
*  2 billion. So huge windfall for President Trump coming. In [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1210.48s)]
*  addition to that, Sachs, you're gonna love this Russia, Russia, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1214.3600000000001s)]
*  Russia, the Guardian is reporting TMTG raised $8 million in [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1217.0800000000002s)]
*  emergency funding that might have possibly come from a [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1221.64s)]
*  russian linked entity. The SPAC while it was on hold was running [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1224.68s)]
*  out of cash Russia linked and you read this all about this and [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1229.48s)]
*  the Guardian, they tried to raise some money, they wound up [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1232.96s)]
*  raising 8 million across two convertible notes from a bank [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1235.24s)]
*  called Paxium located in the Caribbean, owned by a Russian [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1238.64s)]
*  who is reportedly the nephew of Alexander Smirnoff, who used to [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1242.4s)]
*  work in Putin's executive office until 2017. Is this a joke? No, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1247.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, I wish it was a joke, because I know I'm gonna get [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1251.3200000000002s)]
*  barbecued for like by the by the Trump supporters in the [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1254.32s)]
*  comments. But it is crazy that the Russians are [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1257.8s)]
*  named Alexander Smirnoff. Isn't that the name of a vodka? It [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1262.1599999999999s)]
*  kind of is SMI are and over a smear no maybe smirnoff from [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1265.52s)]
*  doesn't even drink. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1270.4399999999998s)]
*  Badly maybe I don't know if Putin drinks or not. Anyway, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1271.9199999999998s)]
*  Trump doesn't drink. That's true. Yeah. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1277.9199999999998s)]
*  If neither does. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1280.48s)]
*  Oh, really? Is that true? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1283.04s)]
*  Yeah. So anyway, important caveats to all this stuff. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1284.56s)]
*  Interesting story, though. There's no indication that Trump [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1287.84s)]

*  Ukraine before US elections. Now, the interesting thing about [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1359.6399999999999s)]
*  this story is that it was reporting allegations by Clint [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1363.9599999999998s)]
*  Watts, who has apparently been hired by Microsoft to run [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1369.8s)]
*  something called the threat analysis center. And his job [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1375.8s)]
*  basically is to find Russian interference in the election. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1378.96s)]
*  Now, here's what I found interesting about this is that [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1382.76s)]
*  Clint Watts that that name rang a bell for me. And it's because [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1385.68s)]
*  Clint Watts was involved in the Twitter files. So back in January [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1390.8s)]
*  of last year, Matt Tybee broke this story in the Twitter files [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1396.76s)]
*  that Clint Watts was running the Hamilton 68 dashboard. He was [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1403.48s)]
*  basically behind that project. He's a former FBI agent. What [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1408.8400000000001s)]
*  was Hamilton 68 Hamilton 68 claim that it was tracking 500 [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1411.92s)]
*  Russian accounts on social media who were engaged in [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1416.88s)]
*  manipulation of online discourse. Well, as it turns [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1421.0s)]
*  out, executives inside of Twitter knew who these accounts [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1425.28s)]
*  were, and they were just American accounts, some Canadian [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1428.2s)]
*  accounts. And in the words of Twitter executives, the whole [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1430.92s)]
*  Hamilton 68 dashboard was bullsh**. That was their word. And [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1433.84s)]
*  nevertheless, this Hamilton 68 project that Clint Watts ran, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1439.32s)]
*  put out story after story for years about how the Russians [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1443.2s)]
*  were meddling in American political debates. And these [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1447.12s)]
*  stories, the Hamilton 68 claims became the basis for thousands [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1451.16s)]
*  literally thousands of mainstream media stories claiming [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1455.16s)]
*  that Russia was interfering in American politics. It all turned [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1459.48s)]
*  out to be a total hoax, a total fraud. Now, the amazing thing to [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1463.52s)]
*  me is you would think after an expose like this, that it would [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1467.4s)]
*  at least be mentioned in the New York Times, that the person [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1471.6000000000001s)]
*  they're quoting as saying that the Russians are meddling in our [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1474.5600000000002s)]

*  And they don't even mention that despite the type of story. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1485.0s)]
*  Moreover, it's amazing to me that this Watts guy not only [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1488.48s)]
*  landed on his feet, he got a cushy job at Microsoft running [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1492.76s)]

*  imagine a less qualified person to be describing Russia threats [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1502.72s)]

*  threats for years. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1511.1200000000001s)]
*  Freebird, your son, Jason, I would just say that, you know, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1512.76s)]
*  going back to the SPF story, the takeaway there is, be careful [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1515.3600000000001s)]
*  what you're imbibing from the mainstream media, because [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1520.24s)]
*  there's always an agenda. And until this story about true [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1522.48s)]
*  social from the Guardian has a little bit more detail to it, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1526.76s)]
*  that makes sense to me, I'm just going to put it in the category [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1530.0s)]
*  of more of the same. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1533.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you know, as I've said on this program before Russia's [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1534.3600000000001s)]
*  explicit strategies, just put their fingerprints on everything [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1537.68s)]

*  agency and all the trolling they were doing the last couple of [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1543.3999999999999s)]
*  elections. Freebird, your thoughts on this? You're [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1545.92s)]
*  concerned about the interference in the election? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1548.04s)]
*  I'm not gonna know my thoughts on this. Yeah, this is this is [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1550.56s)]
*  nothing I feel like I should be thoughtful about. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1554.56s)]
*  Okay, sounds good. All right. And then wrapping up, I had [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1556.84s)]
*  mentioned last episode about the insider trading charges in the [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1559.68s)]

*  there it is, folks. So there's your update. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1595.24s)]
*  What's the relevance of this to being a top issue on the all in [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1596.76s)]
*  pot? I just think this can be a really long seven, I think it's [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1599.24s)]
*  gonna be a really long seven months for us till the election [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1601.88s)]
*  if we're going to bring up every mainstream media story that [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1604.12s)]
*  seeks to create a connection between this one. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1607.6s)]
*  This is an SEC filing. Yeah. It's then this one has been to do [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1610.04s)]
*  a Russian. This is the insider trading one. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1613.36s)]
*  But you just said it has no connection to true social. So [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1615.44s)]
*  why are we even talking? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1617.96s)]
*  No, no, it's these are the people who traded the stock [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1618.6s)]
*  before truth social merge with it. This is the SPAC that [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1622.24s)]
*  was social and they traded when they found out that Trump was [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1625.68s)]
*  going to be the SPAC that was merged with. So I'm just [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1629.24s)]
*  following up closing the loop on that. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1631.6000000000001s)]
*  Breaking news, Google is reportedly considering making an [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1632.92s)]

*  cap. This just came out. Ported by Reuters, we cited anonymous [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1638.8400000000001s)]

*  And so here's our quarterly revenue since IPO. They've been [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1650.8400000000001s)]
*  public for 10 years, as you pointed out in the group chat, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1654.52s)]
*  Friedberg and this has been slow and steady revenue power of [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1657.16s)]
*  SaaS, I guess, and a great product. I'm not a shareholder. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1660.8000000000002s)]

*  stock chart, yada, yada. Chamath, I guess, this is [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1667.48s)]
*  something we've been talking about here, which is M&A and M&A [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1670.88s)]
*  being pushed into the cold plunge and being frozen. And now [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1674.64s)]
*  we see something like this, what do you take from this if [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1679.2s)]
*  it's in fact a true report? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1681.28s)]
*  I mean, I think it's a bit of an odd acquisition. And the reason [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1682.72s)]
*  is that it's become pretty clear for all of big tech that any [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1685.32s)]
*  acquisition that they do is going to be highly scrutinized. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1689.88s)]
*  And so just from an EV expected value perspective, if you're [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1693.1200000000001s)]
*  going to try to acquire something and spend the next [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1698.88s)]
*  year beating your head against regulators, why not do it for [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1701.1200000000001s)]
*  something that's really valuable? And I would not care [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1705.1200000000001s)]
*  characterized HubSpot as strategically valuable for [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1708.32s)]
*  Google. I think it's an important ecosystem player. And [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1711.56s)]
*  it's probably better off as an independent company. So if I [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1714.8s)]
*  were Google, I'd be trying to buy something much more useful [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1717.4399999999998s)]
*  like perplexity or something. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1719.6s)]
*  Freeberg, your thoughts on this? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1723.56s)]
*  First of all, it's super impressive HubSpot's been [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1724.84s)]
*  public, they went public at about a billion dollar market [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1727.24s)]
*  cap 10 years ago. And today they're trading at 34 billion. So [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1729.36s)]
*  organically developed this business and they provide [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1732.8s)]
*  marketing automation software. So basically things like CRM [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1737.0s)]
*  tools, email marketing tools. So when you use advertising tools [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1740.0s)]
*  and you generate leads, those leads come in, what do you do [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1744.32s)]
*  with them? So let's say you're running a website that sells [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1746.8799999999999s)]
*  bicycles, people want information on bicycles, what do [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1749.36s)]
*  you do with those people after they get information on your [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1753.28s)]
*  website? And how do you track them down? And how do you sell [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1755.7199999999998s)]
*  them a bicycle? If you're a big enterprise software company, and [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1757.8799999999999s)]
*  you start to get companies reaching out to you through your [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1761.76s)]
*  website, how do you then convert them to use CRM tools, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1763.88s)]
*  customer relationship management tools, Salesforce is obviously a [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1767.0800000000002s)]
*  behemoth in this space. But HubSpot has this integrated [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1771.5600000000002s)]
*  marketing automation and CRM platform for taking leads, and [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1775.1200000000001s)]
*  then converting those leads and selling products to them. So the [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1780.5200000000002s)]
*  sales team and the marketing team uses HubSpot software to [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1783.92s)]
*  operate and do their work and do it better. When I worked at [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1787.5600000000002s)]
*  Google in 2005, the main thing I worked on is how do we do a [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1791.52s)]
*  better job taking our advertisers and giving them more [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1796.8s)]
*  tools that they can then convert the leads that they're getting [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1801.16s)]
*  into customers. And so one of the first things I worked on in [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1804.8799999999999s)]
*  2004, and then we closed the deal in 2005 was acquiring [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1810.0s)]
*  Urchin, which became Google Analytics, so that companies [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1812.96s)]
*  could better track how folks were converting on their website [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1816.04s)]
*  after they spend marketing dollars on Google, how do you see [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1819.56s)]
*  where those people go on your website and what they're actually [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1822.32s)]
*  doing on the website, and ultimately make your website [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1824.44s)]
*  better so you can sell them more products and more software. And [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1826.84s)]
*  one of the things I worked on was CRM. So I had this [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1829.36s)]
*  conversation with the executive team with Larry and Sergey and [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1832.32s)]
*  others at that time. And we talked about what should we buy a [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1835.1599999999999s)]
*  CRM company. And we actually had a conversation they did with [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1838.52s)]
*  Mark Benioff at the time and we talked about, is there a way to [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1842.1599999999999s)]
*  buy Salesforce and Salesforce went public shortly before [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1844.96s)]
*  Google, and it was more [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1848.48s)]
*  richly valued than I think the appetite was at the time to make [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1851.48s)]
*  this leap to buying a CRM company. We actually spent quite [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1855.3600000000001s)]
*  a bit of time meeting with and I personally spent time meeting [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1858.8s)]
*  with NetSuite, which ultimately got rolled in. I think it was [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1861.0s)]
*  Larry Ellison was the primary owner of NetSuite. We looked at a [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1864.56s)]
*  few other CRM companies. And this was always meant to be the [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1867.44s)]
*  next solution that you plug into the advertising platform at [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1870.96s)]
*  Google. You get all these leads from advertising, and how do you [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1874.1200000000001s)]
*  convert those leads and make them customers. And many of the [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1877.72s)]
*  other things we looked at were things like checkout software, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1880.88s)]
*  and software that would let you run a website to sell your [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1884.0s)]
*  products to customers on the website and so on. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1887.0s)]
*  Which became Shopify in a way. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1888.84s)]
*  Which became Shopify and we had looked very deeply at doing this [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1890.28s)]
*  at Google is actually building a product called Google checkout. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1893.56s)]
*  It wasn't very successful. But it was to do exactly this, which [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1897.44s)]
*  was to build a basically a Shopify type competitor. And so [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1900.44s)]
*  this has always been the natural fit for Google's business. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1904.3600000000001s)]
*  Google made a quarter trillion dollars last year in advertising [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1907.36s)]
*  revenue. And then they didn't make much revenue after the [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1910.8799999999999s)]
*  advertising generated leads, because Google doesn't have a [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1914.28s)]
*  great commerce business and they don't have any of these other [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1917.36s)]
*  enterprise tools. So this is a very natural fit into Google's [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1919.52s)]
*  advertising business. And taking all of the leads from advertising [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1923.4399999999998s)]
*  and better converting them and giving your sales team the tools [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1927.6399999999999s)]
*  they need to convert those leads into customers. So it makes great [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1931.12s)]
*  strategic sense. It's been a concept that's been around for [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1934.28s)]
*  20 years at Google. Certainly they're going to face regulatory [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1936.56s)]
*  scrutiny, but it doesn't have the same sort of overlap with the [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1939.3999999999999s)]
*  ad network businesses, because they're not very heavily in the [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1943.6s)]
*  ad network business at HubSpot. But it's a really good kind of [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1947.04s)]
*  enterprise software plug plug in some would say acquisitions are [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1949.6s)]
*  one of three types they are defensive. They are offensive or [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1952.52s)]
*  they are about reinforcing the status quo. If you had to bucket [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1957.08s)]
*  HubSpot into one of those three things, is this an offensive M&A? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1960.1599999999999s)]
*  Is it a defensive M&A? Or is this status quo? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1964.36s)]
*  I think it gives advertisers more tools that can integrate with [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1969.28s)]
*  AdWords, which is how advertisers spend ad dollars is [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1975.0s)]
*  through AdWords platform. And so as a result, it locks the [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1977.76s)]
*  advertisers on to Google's ad platform, keeps them in [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1981.72s)]
*  defense. And so I think that the benefit to Chimath's point is [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1985.6799999999998s)]
*  that they're going to both protect ad revenue at Google by [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1990.04s)]
*  locking in people on the on the CRM side. And the marginal [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1993.2s)]
*  impact they'll get from selling CRM services, not that impactful [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=1997.96s)]
*  to the business. I mean, if you could spend, let's say with the [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2001.64s)]
*  premium $50 billion on HubSpot, or $5 billion on perplexity, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2004.68s)]
*  today, which one would you buy? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2010.6000000000001s)]
*  I think you've got to buy HubSpot. You're protecting your [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2013.3600000000001s)]
*  point, you're protecting a quarter trillion dollar ad [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2015.8400000000001s)]
*  business. HubSpot makes 2 billion in revenue. So it's 1% of [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2018.0s)]
*  the size of Google's ad business. And it helps you lock [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2022.68s)]
*  in some percentage of that 250 billion. So that's an important [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2026.1200000000001s)]
*  strategic acquisition, I think for Google. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2029.76s)]
*  So you'd rather buy something in marketing automation versus AI? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2031.76s)]
*  I think they should spend the money in AI. But I think you [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2036.0s)]
*  have to buy something to [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2038.28s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2040.64s)]
*  to further the revenue mode. Yeah. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2041.52s)]
*  What does Google accomplish here that they couldn't do with an [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2042.96s)]
*  integration? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2045.04s)]
*  A partnership, you mean? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2047.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, I mean, they could just build on HubSpot's platform, just [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2048.44s)]
*  create a connector between Google Ads and HubSpot. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2051.52s)]
*  I think that exists already. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2054.36s)]
*  Exactly. So what's the point? What do you really understand? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2055.56s)]
*  I think what Freeberg is saying in nicer language is they're [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2058.56s)]
*  going to make it a Roach motel. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2061.56s)]
*  Lock in. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2062.96s)]
*  You get in and you can't get out. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2064.36s)]
*  I mean, it gives you the full lifecycle of the advertiser [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2065.92s)]
*  sack. So I mean, you understand the funnel, right? You get the [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2068.08s)]
*  actual profile of the customer. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2071.12s)]
*  Yeah, the problem with the Roach motel M&A strategy is that [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2073.12s)]
*  people sniff that out pretty quickly. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2075.88s)]
*  Then they start to carve out these very discrete parts of the [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2077.32s)]
*  product that they want you to divest in order to get the whole [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2080.32s)]
*  thing done. That's the thing that surprisingly, I think the [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2082.56s)]
*  regulators have gotten smart about and I suspect it's not that [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2086.6800000000003s)]
*  the regulators themselves know these discrete ideas, but that [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2089.44s)]
*  the answers are fed to them by competitors who want to just [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2092.6800000000003s)]
*  slow these processes down and make these things convoluted and [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2095.48s)]
*  complicated. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2099.76s)]
*  Oh, they snitch. They send the snitch in. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2100.56s)]
*  I think it's very smart for a competitor to actually do that. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2102.92s)]
*  I think it's very smart for a competitor to actually call a [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2105.52s)]
*  regulator and give them a roadmap of how to make the deal [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2107.84s)]
*  happen, but in a very convoluted, complicated way. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2112.32s)]
*  You remember, I suspect that's what happened in Microsoft [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2116.24s)]
*  Activision. Microsoft brilliantly fought it off, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2118.64s)]
*  right? And so they were able to get the whole thing done [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2121.52s)]
*  completely on their terms. But in many other cases, you get [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2123.4s)]
*  these discrete things where it's like, okay, divest this, sell [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2126.24s)]
*  that, keep this and it's like, why are we doing this? But I [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2128.84s)]
*  just think the Roach-Motel strategy is harder to get done [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2133.12s)]
*  these days because folks will know how to make it super [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2136.3599999999997s)]
*  convoluted. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2139.48s)]
*  I will tell you, when a big company like this makes a big [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2140.3599999999997s)]
*  acquisition offer like this, as much as I know Google's [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2143.72s)]
*  business, I think it's a generalization that can be drawn [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2146.8399999999997s)]
*  here. It's usually a negative signal about organic growth. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2149.72s)]
*  Meaning if I'm a Google shareholder, I should look at [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2155.52s)]
*  this and I should say, why do you need to make this [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2158.88s)]
*  acquisition? Why is there an indication in this bid that [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2161.92s)]
*  there is some advertising revenue leakage going on? And [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2166.2000000000003s)]
*  then I should go spend time trying to understand that. I [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2169.76s)]
*  think there's a really important question there. Yeah. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2173.12s)]
*  But this is why I'm asking you like, obviously, they're not [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2175.16s)]
*  going to do this because things are going perfectly in that [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2177.64s)]
*  space. And so if you're losing share, you're not going to be [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2179.76s)]
*  losing it to Bing, you're losing it to some form of AI, which is [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2182.88s)]
*  why, again, it's a bit of a head scratcher. Spend a lot less [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2185.6s)]
*  money and just buy everything in the space or spend 50 billion [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2188.84s)]
*  by everything possible in the space. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2191.64s)]
*  To give you just a little context here, this is going to [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2193.72s)]
*  be by far their largest acquisition. If it's true, if [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2196.2799999999997s)]
*  it gets closed, this is all speculation right now. Looking [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2198.8399999999997s)]
*  back, Motorola Mobility was bought for 12.5 billion, there [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2201.64s)]
*  were patents, there was the hardware business, which they [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2205.12s)]
*  spun out, you can look up the deal details there. But there's [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2206.7599999999998s)]
*  a long tail of companies they've bought Nest Labs, Fitbit and [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2210.2799999999997s)]
*  YouTube, 3 billion, 2 billion, 1.6 billion, if you remember, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2214.96s)]
*  they bought a Mandiant, I've never even heard of the cyber [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2218.7599999999998s)]
*  security company 5.4 billion, they bought Nest for 3 billion, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2221.8399999999997s)]
*  double click 3 billion, that was a long time ago, so probably [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2224.64s)]
*  triple that value in today's dollars. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2226.7999999999997s)]
*  By the way, remember Fitbit, Fitbit took 18 or 24 months to [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2228.6s)]
*  close. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2233.0s)]
*  Took a while. Yeah. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2233.96s)]
*  Deep, deeply scrutinized. If you think a wearable on your wrist [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2235.36s)]
*  is going to get scrutinized when bought by Google, imagine what [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2238.4s)]
*  happens when a $50 billion marketing automation company [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2240.6s)]
*  gets bought by Google. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2243.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's really interesting. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2244.92s)]
*  Look, I don't think this acquisition makes any sense. I'm [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2246.2s)]
*  kind of in Jemma's camp. This is this would be a very odd [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2249.0s)]
*  acquisition. I'm not even sure the story is true. There's been [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2251.68s)]
*  no confirmation of an actual bid made. This was basically an [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2253.7999999999997s)]
*  anonymous source saying that Google had hired investment [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2257.04s)]
*  bankers to, you know, maybe kick the tires. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2259.96s)]
*  Well, typically, these bankers float these trial balloons like [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2263.04s)]
*  this, because they want to pump the deal. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2265.8399999999997s)]
*  But yeah, imagine what the fees would be on $50 billion [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2268.6s)]
*  acquisition. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2271.2s)]
*  But they want to shake some other buyers loose. Yeah, when [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2272.9199999999996s)]
*  have these auctions? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2275.2s)]
*  Well, look, it's gonna be very hard for any big tech company to [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2277.3199999999997s)]
*  do a $50 billion acquisition of anything just that given that [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2279.96s)]
*  Lina Conn and the FTC are opposed to bigness in and of [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2283.12s)]
*  itself. But I think from a strategic point of view, I [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2285.68s)]
*  agree this this deal would be odd. I don't really see the [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2289.3599999999997s)]
*  connection to the Google Ads business. HubSpot is used by [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2291.96s)]
*  companies to manage their pipelines. It's a competitive [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2296.2799999999997s)]
*  Salesforce. I see it all the time. I see startups using it [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2298.8399999999997s)]
*  all the time as the alternative to Salesforce, because it's sort [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2302.6s)]
*  of easier to use more user friendly. And the main thing it [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2306.12s)]
*  does is you have your pipeline in there, you bring in the leads [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2309.08s)]
*  at the top of the funnel, and then you work them down to close [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2312.72s)]
*  deals. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2315.68s)]
*  Where do those leads come from, Sachs? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2316.32s)]
*  I understand that they can come from Google AdWords, but [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2318.36s)]
*  most of them come from from ad spend. That's the connection. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2321.32s)]
*  And it's always been this idea that those two should be [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2324.92s)]
*  integrated. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2326.92s)]
*  Okay, but but the point is that if you think about your top of [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2328.16s)]
*  funnel, if you're one of the customers of HubSpot using this, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2332.24s)]
*  Google AdWords is just one of a number of channels. That's right. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2336.3999999999996s)]
*  So you could be getting your leads through inbound, you could [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2339.8399999999997s)]
*  be getting your leads through events, you could be getting [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2343.7999999999997s)]
*  your leads through I mean, there's so many different [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2347.4399999999996s)]
*  sources. So it doesn't make sense to me that somehow, Google [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2349.68s)]
*  would need to acquire a company to manage not their advertisers, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2356.3999999999996s)]
*  but the people their advertisers are trying to reach as one of a [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2360.88s)]
*  dozen different potential marketing channels. It just [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2364.28s)]
*  doesn't really make sense. I mean, the acquisitions where [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2366.8s)]
*  Google has been really successful have been broad [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2369.28s)]
*  horizontal platform plays like Android. This is as vertical as [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2372.08s)]
*  it gets. This is CRM software. This is basically Google getting [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2376.36s)]
*  into a vertical app for sales and marketing teams. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2380.08s)]
*  Yeah, I have a CRM. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2384.76s)]
*  If you think about the business that this is most like, it would [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2386.6400000000003s)]
*  be G Suite. And because it's an enterprise play. And that's the [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2389.76s)]
*  most neglected part of Google's business. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2394.5600000000004s)]
*  I think you're both missing a key piece to this. I think this [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2396.76s)]
*  is about the data. You look at these, these are the leads and [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2398.84s)]
*  the great contacts in the database of the customer, which [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2402.5200000000004s)]
*  Google doesn't have access to. And they can close the loop and [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2405.6400000000003s)]
*  they can make targeting of ads and get people deeper and they [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2408.36s)]
*  can fight for a larger percentage. So to your points [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2412.2000000000003s)]
*  acts, yes, you've got 20 different inbound feeds coming [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2414.76s)]
*  in for leads. If Google knows the leads that are already in [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2418.68s)]
*  there, they can then retarget them across their entire ad [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2421.9199999999996s)]
*  network, which is the largest in the world. That's the value if [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2424.56s)]
*  I know your 10,000 best customers, and then I know when [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2427.56s)]
*  they're on Google searching, and I know that when they're in a [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2430.7599999999998s)]
*  Chrome browser, I know when they're on an Android phone, if [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2432.96s)]
*  they happen to use that, man, I can just start getting more of [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2435.12s)]
*  your ad dollars into it. That's what's actually happening here. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2438.44s)]
*  It's they don't want to SaaS business. They want the data, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2440.7599999999998s)]
*  they want to retarget folks, and then they want to make close [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2443.64s)]
*  more sales and be more efficient than TikTok and Facebook and [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2447.16s)]
*  meta. It's about [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2450.2799999999997s)]
*  you think they'd be allowed to use their customers data to [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2451.0s)]
*  somehow target their ad product? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2454.6s)]
*  Absolutely 100% if you if I'm opting into it and I say, hey, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2456.0s)]
*  you have 10,000 people in your database, you want to go find [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2459.68s)]
*  them we have you have 8000 of them connected that came in [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2461.92s)]
*  through Google search. What about the other 12,000 you want [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2464.3199999999997s)]
*  to try to find them in the Google ad network, we can put [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2466.68s)]
*  that together for you. That's actually if somebody is going to [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2468.7599999999998s)]
*  snitch on this deal, it's about the data. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2471.52s)]
*  I'll tell you back in just improving conversion rates drives [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2474.0s)]
*  more ad revenue. Bingo. And the key measurement we had the year [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2478.4s)]
*  after we bought urchin and launched Google Analytics was we [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2483.1600000000003s)]
*  looked at how much an advertiser spent on Google's AdWords [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2486.28s)]
*  network before and after they installed Google Analytics. And [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2489.7200000000003s)]
*  that year, it was a ton of money at the time, we saw an [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2494.1600000000003s)]
*  incremental roughly $500 million in revenue in ad spend with [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2497.36s)]
*  folks who installed Google Analytics from before versus [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2502.96s)]
*  after, because they then started to change their websites and [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2506.4s)]
*  tweak their sales flow or their marketing flow on their website [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2509.12s)]
*  to better convert customers so they could spend more on the [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2512.84s)]
*  network because higher conversion rates means you can [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2515.12s)]
*  spend a higher CPM on advertising. So the deeper you [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2517.56s)]
*  go from an integration perspective and closing sales, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2521.72s)]
*  the better you actually can get and the more money you can spend [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2525.12s)]
*  on marketing on the front end. And so that benefits the growth [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2528.12s)]
*  in the network. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2530.68s)]
*  And to build on your point, Freberg, this is why Amazon and [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2531.2s)]
*  Uber and Instacart have become such major major players in [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2534.72s)]
*  advertising. They have the data on sales information, they sell [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2538.64s)]
*  conversion drop off and they sell conversions at the point [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2542.6s)]
*  sacks of the shopping cart about to be clicked on. And Amazon's [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2546.2799999999997s)]
*  been taking some of that in Instacart, but intercepting some [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2550.6s)]
*  of those ads. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2554.12s)]
*  Yeah, I'll speculate on this for a second. I think that if I'm [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2554.7599999999998s)]
*  sitting inside of Google, I see the capability of our AI tools, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2557.56s)]
*  our generative AI tools in being able to improve marketing and [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2561.68s)]
*  sales processes. And I'm saying, how do we leverage that? Well, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2565.44s)]
*  guess what, we don't actually have access to our advertisers, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2569.96s)]
*  sales and marketing automation workflow, because we don't have [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2572.68s)]
*  a CRM tool. So then the natural strategic thing is how do we get [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2576.08s)]
*  a CRM tool? Okay, well, we can't buy Salesforce. Well, we could [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2580.2799999999997s)]
*  buy HubSpot. That makes sense. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2583.84s)]
*  Number two plus. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2585.2799999999997s)]
*  Then we could apply our generative AI capabilities to [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2585.88s)]
*  improve conversion efficiency at HubSpot and probably grow revenue [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2589.52s)]
*  there as well. So it could be a fairly quickly a creative deal. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2592.2400000000002s)]
*  And there's the benefit to the ad network. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2595.48s)]
*  I think the Roach Motel idea is probably the best strategy here. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2597.08s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. I just think if I were them with $50 billion, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2600.96s)]
*  they're like, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2603.76s)]
*  Well, $30 billion, by the way. $35 billion. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2605.12s)]
*  He said premium, they gotta pay 50% more, 25% more. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2607.12s)]
*  It's already floated up. So you got to imagine it's probably a [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2610.2400000000002s)]
*  $40 billion deal. Yeah. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2612.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay, 40. Okay. So they save 10 billion. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2614.0s)]
*  I think the synergies here are negligible. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2616.68s)]
*  If it took Google almost two years to get a an accelerometer on [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2619.12s)]
*  a wrist approved from antitrust, this is going to take three [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2623.28s)]
*  years. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2625.88s)]
*  Sax. Yeah. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2626.2000000000003s)]
*  So why bother? So like do something much more disruptive? [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2627.16s)]
*  I have an answer to that. But I want to hear Sax's first. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2629.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, I just looked up how many customers HubSpot has. HubSpot [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2632.4s)]
*  has 205,000 customers as of the end of 2023. Now you look up [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2635.48s)]
*  Google AdWords, it has 1.2 million businesses. Okay. And I'm [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2639.6s)]
*  sure that's not 100% overlapping. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2644.32s)]
*  Every one of them should be using HubSpot. That's hugely [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2646.92s)]
*  creative. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2649.32s)]
*  I agree. Yeah. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2649.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't think that Google has the leverage to drive all of its [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2651.32s)]
*  AdWord customers into using a CRM product. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2655.32s)]
*  It doesn't need all of them. If it gets 5% of them, it makes [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2656.96s)]
*  this deal make sense. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2659.6s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2661.7599999999998s)]
*  That part is kind of interesting. If they can actually drive [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2662.2799999999997s)]
*  their ad customers. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2665.24s)]
*  That's what they did with DoubleClick. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2666.2799999999997s)]
*  DoubleClick was actually advertising. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2667.72s)]
*  No, but they had other other places that they could take [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2669.2s)]
*  their AdWords advertisers to spend that the DoubleClick [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2671.3999999999996s)]
*  network had access to. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2674.04s)]
*  Anyway, I hear you. Yeah. And there was another set of [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2675.2s)]
*  advertising audit management tools that DoubleClick had that [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2678.04s)]
*  that's an enterprise software tool that they were able to sell [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2680.6s)]
*  into their advertisers that they didn't have themselves. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2682.96s)]
*  Chamath, let me ask you a markets question here. If we wind [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2685.16s)]
*  up with a Republican conservative GOP presidency and [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2689.2799999999997s)]
*  administration for the next four years, which seems like a [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2694.0s)]
*  possibility here, strong possibility. What does that do [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2697.2799999999997s)]
*  for M&A markets? Do you think they might be opening up here? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2700.0s)]
*  And the reason Google's even considering this is because they [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2702.56s)]
*  anticipate this deal might fall into a new administration that [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2706.4s)]
*  is going to fire a Lina Khan? Possibly, probably. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2710.6s)]
*  I actually think that I think the Democrats and the [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2714.08s)]
*  Republicans are really well aligned here. They don't like [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2716.44s)]
*  deals. And I don't think you're going to see a big sea change. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2718.96s)]
*  They hate big tech for different reasons, but they equally want [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2722.7999999999997s)]
*  to slow them down. If you look at the non big tech M&A deals, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2726.84s)]
*  they're going to get slowed down for different reasons. So, for [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2732.08s)]
*  example, like the big US deal merger with Nippon Steel that [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2734.56s)]
*  was announced, Biden has one set of issues, but I suspect, you [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2737.6400000000003s)]
*  know, if Donald Trump were to get elected, his issues will be [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2741.1200000000003s)]
*  more about further hollowing out middle America. And so that deal [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2743.2000000000003s)]
*  will probably get stopped for different reasons. But so I [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2748.36s)]
*  think that they're both actually roughly aligned and not [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2752.6000000000004s)]
*  allowing a lot of this big M&A to happen. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2756.76s)]
*  But for different reasons. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2759.48s)]
*  For different reasons, but the outcome is the same. So this is [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2761.0s)]
*  why I would just kind of think like if you're going to do a [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2763.4s)]
*  deal, you got to do something that's like small enough where [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2765.32s)]
*  it'll pass muster, you know, it to be really valuable. And the [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2770.6800000000003s)]
*  regulators will be like, ah, whatever, just let it happen. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2774.36s)]
*  Sax, what do you think you think a Trump administration would [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2777.2400000000002s)]
*  become more frisky allow more M&A they seem to be actually [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2780.28s)]
*  closing up to tack in a major way? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2783.0400000000004s)]
*  Well, I agree with Jamath that there's a lot of anger on the [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2785.2799999999997s)]
*  Republican side towards big tech because of censorship and bias. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2788.2s)]
*  And Google is as guilty of that as any of these big tech [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2791.3999999999996s)]
*  companies. So I don't expect Republican administration to [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2793.9199999999996s)]
*  have Google on its good graces. That being said, I do think [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2798.64s)]
*  Republicans have a more traditional definition of [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2801.52s)]
*  antitrust than Lena Conn does. And I think that a Republican [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2804.6s)]
*  antitrust enforcer would probably be guided by market [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2810.64s)]
*  share considerations first and foremost. And so in this case, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2815.08s)]
*  since Google does not have a CRM play, then based on a [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2819.7599999999998s)]
*  traditional definition of antitrust, they would be able to [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2823.7599999999998s)]
*  make this acquisition. Whereas I think again, Lena Conn is just [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2825.8799999999997s)]
*  opposed to bigness and doesn't want big tech companies getting [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2829.3599999999997s)]
*  any bigger. So there's no guarantee that Republicans would [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2831.3999999999996s)]
*  allow it. I would say that if you got the right FTC [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2835.12s)]
*  commissioner or right DOJ, I'd say there's a possibility of [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2839.16s)]
*  it being more likely to go through. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2843.16s)]
*  To remind everybody, Lena Conn's interpretation of antitrust is [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2844.7599999999998s)]
*  future competition and trying to protect future competition. The [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2850.2799999999997s)]
*  traditional one is consumer based. Hey, are consumers [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2853.12s)]
*  benefiting or not? And so that's actually that's one of the top [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2856.0s)]
*  three. Yes, I want to have free bird. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2859.8399999999997s)]
*  Market share is really the traditional test. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2861.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, market share and then the impact that has on consumer [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2863.3599999999997s)]
*  choice and price. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2866.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, can I just go back onto this synergy point? I just want [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2867.24s)]
*  to like, I just want to brainstorm about this for a [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2869.52s)]
*  second. Let's say you're one of Google's 1.2 million businesses [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2872.08s)]
*  that are using AdWords. There's a high chance you're also using [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2876.12s)]
*  Facebook. There's a high chance you're also doing other kinds [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2878.8399999999997s)]
*  of advertising. You might be doing physical world [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2882.3599999999997s)]
*  advertising. You might be doing events. There might be a dozen [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2884.72s)]
*  different channels through which you get leads. Now all of a [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2888.4s)]
*  sudden, Google sends you an email saying, hey, we acquired [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2891.2s)]
*  HubSpot. You know, why don't you click here to use us for CRM? Is [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2894.12s)]
*  that really going to drive a change in behavior from a small [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2899.36s)]
*  business beyond what they would already do today? It doesn't [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2902.84s)]
*  seem that synergistic to me. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2906.32s)]
*  Some percent of them. Not all maybe 5%. Again, that 5% is 50,000. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2907.44s)]
*  That's an email campaign. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2912.04s)]
*  I mean, I just don't see the leverage basically. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2915.6s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if I agree. But I mean, that's why we're [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2918.04s)]
*  here. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2920.72s)]
*  If Google did a deep product integration where the leads [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2922.0s)]
*  that you acquired through Google AdWords magically appeared in [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2925.84s)]
*  HubSpot, and that's where you went to go work them, then yes, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2930.52s)]
*  maybe there'd be synergy. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2934.8s)]
*  Just looking at this on the numbers, since we like to do [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2937.52s)]
*  back of the envelope here, $250 billion ad revenue, 1.2 [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2939.88s)]
*  million in advertisers. It's almost exactly like 200,000 per [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2942.64s)]
*  advertiser. Obviously, there's some big ones. Obviously, there's [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2945.76s)]
*  a long tail. Man, if you can get some number of those to spend [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2948.16s)]
*  10, 20, 30% more, it could be quite a creative match on the [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2951.72s)]
*  bottom line, it would pay for the acquisition over a short [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2954.96s)]
*  period of time. And we'll see. It's interesting discussion for [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2956.8399999999997s)]
*  sure. All right, if you missed it, Jon Stewart did a segment on [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2960.44s)]
*  AI on The Daily Show. He came back, he's doing I think, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2963.64s)]
*  Mondays every week. And it went viral. And it was about how AI [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2966.0s)]
*  is going to change our jobs faster than any previous labor [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2971.72s)]
*  revolution. So it seems like the public is starting to get an [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2975.2s)]
*  idea about AI wiping out large swaths of jobs, and it's starting [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2978.7999999999997s)]
*  to hit the mainstream. CEOs like Brian Chesky from Airbnb and [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2983.4399999999996s)]
*  Aaron Levy from Box. I had them on this week in startups in the [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2987.2s)]
*  last year, they said they anticipate 30 to 50% productivity [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2990.96s)]
*  gains for a lot of the jobs in their companies, developers, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2993.8799999999997s)]
*  customer support, all that stuff. And we covered Kloners AI [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2996.8799999999997s)]
*  customer support agent, doing the job of 700 full time [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=2999.56s)]
*  employees and driving a $40 million increase in profits [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3002.68s)]
*  this year, yada, yada, yada. We've talked about this over and [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3005.3599999999997s)]
*  over again, but it seems to be tipping over into public [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3008.3599999999997s)]
*  consciousness. We have talked about whether humans will find [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3011.52s)]
*  more work to do or if this is going to truly displace people, I [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3016.0s)]
*  think we all kind of feel like, at least to the best of my [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3018.44s)]
*  memory, we all feel like new jobs will be created, but it is [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3021.72s)]
*  entering the public's consciousness. What impact is [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3024.9199999999996s)]
*  that going to have? If the public starts thinking AI is [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3027.08s)]
*  going to take their job, Chamath? [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3030.16s)]
*  I mean, I think that social media will make this perception [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3032.6s)]
*  more widespread than it's been at other moments of revolution [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3035.56s)]
*  and innovation. But we've gone through this before. I'd like to [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3039.7599999999998s)]
*  summarize my thoughts in three charts. Okay. And I call this [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3043.08s)]
*  this time, it's not different. So chart number one for those [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3048.3999999999996s)]
*  watching on YouTube is a look at the components of US GDP. This [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3052.48s)]
*  is from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Now this goes from [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3056.6s)]
*  1929 up to 2011. So it doesn't go all the way back to the 1800s [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3060.7599999999998s)]
*  and we're missing the last decade. But the point is the [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3064.7599999999998s)]
*  following, if you can see the chart, if you can't see it, I'll [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3068.08s)]
*  describe it to you, which is that GDP, the components of GDP [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3070.44s)]
*  are surprisingly resilient and roughly the same over long [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3074.64s)]
*  stretches of time, which is that even though GDP goes up, consumer [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3078.6s)]
*  consumption is always around 70%. Net exports are a few [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3082.88s)]
*  percent plus or minus gross domestic investment is around the [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3087.7200000000003s)]
*  20% level. And then government consumption is around the 20% [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3091.56s)]
*  level. And that's what adds up to GDP. So that's an important [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3095.84s)]
*  thing to note. Why? Because in the absence of something very [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3101.0s)]
*  acute, like World War Two, these things don't change over long [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3104.84s)]
*  periods of time. Okay, so if that is true, what happens when [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3108.08s)]
*  you have any kind of a revolution? So let's look at the [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3111.6s)]
*  industrial revolution. So the shift from farms to factories. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3115.68s)]
*  And what you saw was exactly what people should be worried [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3118.7999999999997s)]
*  about with respect to AI, which is in specific job classes, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3122.68s)]
*  things just fall to zero. So unemployment basically went to [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3126.56s)]
*  zero. And the income associated with those jobs also went to [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3130.36s)]
*  zero. So this is what people are worried about. But if you [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3133.72s)]
*  remember the last chart, the point is somehow we found a way [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3137.24s)]
*  to find growth. And this is what's demonstrated on this [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3141.64s)]
*  final chart, which is when you look at US productivity and [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3146.16s)]
*  worker compensation, this is going from World War Two to [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3148.66s)]
*  today, you find that every time we find a new way of innovating, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3151.06s)]
*  compensation tends to track it. So if you take these three [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3157.06s)]
*  things together, number one, which is the components of GDP [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3161.28s)]
*  rarely change. Number two is that yes, there are certain [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3164.0s)]
*  categories of jobs that always get disrupted away. But the [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3167.16s)]
*  third is the most important, which is that as productivity [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3171.3599999999997s)]
*  goes up, which is what AI should give us, just as we've seen in [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3174.08s)]
*  the past, compensation also goes up, which means new job classes [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3177.96s)]
*  will be created. So I think the macro picture, if you look back [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3181.3599999999997s)]
*  hundreds of years is that this is like many other moments in [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3185.3999999999996s)]
*  time, it feels more personal right now, because we're all [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3188.8399999999997s)]
*  living it, right? None. Few of us live the agrarian to [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3191.74s)]
*  industrial revolution. Yeah, we missed it. And few of us live [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3194.74s)]
*  the technological revolution, right? We kind of came in at the [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3198.8199999999997s)]
*  heels of it. But I suspect that this time is not different. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3201.24s)]
*  Freeberg, your thoughts on this? I think you've said something [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3204.9399999999996s)]
*  similar on past episodes. But it is kind of tipping and into [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3208.22s)]
*  public consciousness. And it's also affecting white collar [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3213.2599999999998s)]
*  jobs this time, not just people in fields picking berries. And [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3216.54s)]
*  so those people may be a little more vocal. And we've seen [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3220.54s)]
*  massive layoffs in tech, massive layoffs in media. And [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3223.44s)]
*  those jobs don't seem to be coming back, people seem to be [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3226.92s)]
*  get taking the gains and just having people on the team be 30% [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3229.64s)]
*  more efficient, as Brian told me on my other pod. So what do you [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3233.6s)]
*  think Freeberg? Is this time different? Or is it the same? [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3237.76s)]
*  So here's this article from June 2 1983 in the New York Times all [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3242.4s)]
*  about how computers are eliminating jobs in industries [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3248.6s)]
*  that were effectively offline knowledge work industries at the [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3253.2799999999997s)]
*  time, creating engineering designs, creating architectural [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3257.0s)]
*  drawings. I think this article spoke to the fact that these [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3260.0s)]
*  jobs were going to be eliminated. And as we all know, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3262.96s)]
*  those jobs actually got enhanced by computers, productivity went [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3266.24s)]
*  up, and new sub industries emerged. And in fact, the overall [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3270.08s)]
*  industries actually grew in some cases when we were fearful of [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3273.4s)]
*  them being replaced due to the automation enabled by software. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3276.76s)]
*  So I think that in this particular sense, we can talk [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3280.32s)]
*  about the Industrial Revolution enabling through manufacturing [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3284.6800000000003s)]
*  systems and centralized production, a replacement of [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3287.92s)]
*  manual labor with machines. What we're talking about now is a [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3293.2000000000003s)]
*  replacement of knowledge work that has been aided by computers [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3297.2000000000003s)]
*  with machines. So the machines no longer even need the human. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3300.8s)]
*  But the reality is that these systems are actually going to [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3303.88s)]
*  give humans 10 to 100 x leverage. So when you think about [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3306.46s)]
*  that one person could spend three weeks making an architectural [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3310.7s)]
*  drawing today, what if that one person could make an [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3314.1s)]
*  architectural drawing every six hours? So the question then is, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3316.66s)]
*  do we stop making architectural drawings and we fire a bunch of [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3321.54s)]
*  architects? Or does the cost of making an architectural drawing [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3324.2200000000003s)]
*  drop by 90% and it enables us to do more detailed, higher [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3328.06s)]
*  resolution architectural drawings across more places, more [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3332.26s)]
*  frequently, and the industry actually booms. And what we've [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3336.22s)]
*  seen historically is that when productivity goes up, costs go [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3339.9399999999996s)]
*  down, the actual volume balloons and the economy grows. So it's [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3343.62s)]
*  an example where I think in this particular case, we will see [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3348.22s)]
*  these tools creating more leverage for knowledge work [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3352.1s)]
*  instead of just simply replacing knowledge work, and that humans [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3354.9399999999996s)]
*  will start to shift to a higher order of work. And we'll see the [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3358.14s)]
*  economy grow and productivity go up as a result. So I think [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3361.42s)]
*  that's my kind of key read on the story. But it's very hard to [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3366.62s)]
*  connect the dots for people without having all of these [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3370.06s)]
*  historical cases. And I think one of the ways to think about [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3372.7400000000002s)]
*  doing this usefully is you go back to the software revolution, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3375.7400000000002s)]
*  and all the stuff that we were doing with pencils and papers [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3378.66s)]
*  before computers, we actually didn't lose all those jobs, the [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3381.1800000000003s)]
*  people could now do 100 times or 1000 or million times as much [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3385.4s)]
*  work, and new industries emerged and productivity went up, and [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3388.42s)]
*  the economy grew. And so we just have to have this this realization [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3391.86s)]
*  as this starts to take hold, that the industries will change. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3396.78s)]
*  And that the systems will actually provide leverage, not [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3401.9s)]
*  replacement. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3404.58s)]
*  Yeah, so such a good point. And I think what you teach your kids [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3405.78s)]
*  is a really important at this moment in time, like having a job [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3409.34s)]
*  that is replaced by AI, or that could be greatly replaced by AI [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3413.02s)]
*  might be a mistake. And if you think about being a conductor [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3417.14s)]
*  Freiburg or a maestro, a conductor of an orchestra, I [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3419.94s)]
*  think that's the job of the future is can you work with [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3423.98s)]
*  these agents forget about co pilots, because that's phase one [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3427.22s)]
*  of all this, but agents are phase two, where you have an [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3429.5s)]
*  agent who's writing copy, who's the HubSpot example you get [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3432.3799999999997s)]
*  before, you know, a designer who's in the cloud, who's an [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3436.3399999999997s)]
*  agent, an AI agent making you artwork, and then you stitch all [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3439.3399999999997s)]
*  these things together. I've been loading chat jpt with my kids [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3442.46s)]
*  constantly, asking history questions and whatever questions [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3446.1s)]
*  they want. I've been teaching them how to use chat jpt. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3449.3399999999997s)]
*  That's great. Yeah, I mean, I think it's like, like, there's [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3451.58s)]
*  this whole transition of humans, doing manual labor to doing [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3453.74s)]
*  knowledge work, where you're using software to create digital [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3457.8199999999997s)]
*  output, to now having more folks spend more of their time being [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3461.22s)]
*  conceptualists or creators where you can kind of be an architect [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3465.56s)]
*  or a creator of something, and the system just generates it, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3468.8199999999997s)]
*  you know, you state your intended objective and the system [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3473.14s)]
*  solves for it. Yes, as opposed to, hey, I got to go build the [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3475.5s)]
*  Excel spreadsheet and check the formula in every cell and do [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3479.1s)]
*  all the manual. What if I just say, hey, here's what I want the [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3482.46s)]
*  model to do, please generate it for me. And you get the result. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3484.22s)]
*  It enables you to do 100 times more. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3487.38s)]
*  That's why I use the analogy conductor, or Augusta leader. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3489.46s)]
*  Sax, what do you think this is your, your, you're on the [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3493.46s)]
*  populist side, you really have your finger on what Americans [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3496.26s)]
*  think. And that's a compliment. It's a literal compliment. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3499.7s)]
*  But I do think you're I think you've become a pop, especially [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3505.5s)]
*  as the longer I've known you, you know, for over 20 years, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3507.94s)]
*  you've become more populist. So what's the word on the street [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3510.38s)]
*  here amongst, you know, Jen pop, and when I think they're taking [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3513.22s)]
*  this news, when they see somebody like john Stewart, they [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3517.14s)]
*  respect when you see somebody like Jonathan's john Stewart, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3519.46s)]
*  you know, doing this, that's like gonna hit a large swath of [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3522.3s)]
*  these, you know, you know, elites that we've talked about [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3525.7s)]
*  before on the show who are losing their jobs, or maybe [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3529.34s)]
*  their salaries are getting capped. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3531.38s)]
*  Well, first of all, Jason, to quote Senator raucous from [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3533.42s)]
*  gladiator, I may not be a man of the people, but I do try to be a [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3536.42s)]
*  man for the people. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3540.14s)]
*  Exactly. So, oh, my god, did you see the AI? Did you see the AI [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3542.18s)]
*  from some Y company or company? Or where they like made a little [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3546.7s)]
*  video of us. And like we're talking about somebody's nuts. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3550.22s)]
*  And then they were like, you said, Oh, I'm gonna ask my [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3553.62s)]
*  butler to ask my assistant to ask my house manager to then [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3556.22s)]
*  ask my chauffeur to pick those up. It's like, it's a pretty [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3559.82s)]
*  great clip. Yeah, it looks funny. Look, to be frank, no one [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3564.1000000000004s)]
*  cares what john Stewart thinks. He's never been less relevant [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3568.2200000000003s)]
*  and less funny. This is a story that immediately has been [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3572.6200000000003s)]
*  hyping up for months now. COVID is over. So they need something [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3576.0800000000004s)]
*  else to scare us with. And what they really should be talking is [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3579.86s)]
*  that we've got two wars that risks spiraling out of control. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3583.1800000000003s)]
*  And that they don't want to go there. They don't want to go [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3586.7000000000003s)]
*  there or the national debt exactly right. They don't want [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3589.3s)]
*  to go there either. Those issues reflect well on the current [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3591.82s)]
*  administration and power. So they're going to scare us with [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3596.5s)]
*  this. Now look, in the short to medium term, AI leads to [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3599.26s)]
*  productivity gains. In the long term, it may lead to job losses. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3602.38s)]
*  But as you guys pointed out, hopefully by then we'll have [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3606.2200000000003s)]
*  lots of other jobs created by the productivity boom that we're [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3608.94s)]
*  going to get. And this has been the case throughout history with [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3612.0600000000004s)]
*  regard to technology improvements. And if we don't [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3614.94s)]
*  have these productivity improvements, what's going to [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3617.42s)]
*  drive the growth in GDP? What's going to allow us to pay off this [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3619.7400000000002s)]
*  enormous national debt that seems to be, you know, so large [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3623.06s)]
*  that we it's unrepayable. We need the productivity gains that [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3626.66s)]
*  AI is going to unlock without them we're definitely toast. So [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3630.3s)]
*  look, I don't place a lot of stock in this Jon Stewart story. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3633.82s)]
*  It's just one of many that the media is creating to try and [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3638.06s)]
*  scare us about AI. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3641.02s)]
*  That's actually a great guest. Jon Stewart would be a great [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3641.98s)]
*  guest along with Lena Kahn. Put those on the list. Have you seen [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3644.54s)]
*  this clip where Jan LeCun basically says, our best LLM is [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3646.92s)]
*  50 times smaller than what a four year old has processed [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3651.76s)]
*  since they've been born? [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3655.38s)]
*  A four year old is awake, has been awake a total of 16,000 [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3655.96s)]
*  hours. And you say, okay, 16,000 hours multiply this by 3600 [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3659.92s)]
*  seconds per hour. And then figure out like what's the [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3665.0s)]
*  bandwidth of the optical nerve going to the cortex, it's about [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3669.28s)]
*  20 megabytes where you have 1 million nerve fibers per [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3672.88s)]
*  eye and it's about 10 bytes per second, right? Give or take. So [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3677.28s)]
*  multiply, that's 10 to the 15 bytes by the time you're four, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3681.6800000000003s)]
*  50 times more than whatever LLM, like the biggest LLM in the [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3685.6400000000003s)]
*  world have been trained on. Okay. So what that tells you is [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3689.2000000000003s)]
*  that in the space of a few months, the baby has seen more [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3693.32s)]
*  information than the biggest LLMs that we have. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3697.0s)]
*  The point is that, and this is one of the foremost experts in AI [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3699.08s)]
*  and really one of the fathers of modern AI. What he's [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3702.68s)]
*  basically saying is it's still more artificial than intelligent. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3705.56s)]
*  And everybody needs to take a deep breath and understand that [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3709.7599999999998s)]
*  there's just going to be a lot more work before you get to this [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3713.3999999999996s)]
*  omnipresent agent that just replaces and destroys everything [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3716.3599999999997s)]
*  and thinks on its own. Yeah, I'm willing to bet on all of us [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3719.44s)]
*  versus a bunch of four year olds. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3722.7999999999997s)]
*  And I just want to say kumbaya to Davos as well. The clip from [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3724.44s)]
*  Davos, thanks for letting us use that. Yeah, it's interesting, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3727.96s)]
*  sacks like the number of jobs that will be replaced or [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3731.76s)]
*  augmented, and then the creation of jobs. And then you start [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3737.48s)]
*  thinking about, well, how many jobs exist in the real world? I [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3740.44s)]
*  saw Waymo is doing Uber Eats deliveries. And you just think, [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3743.0800000000004s)]
*  wow, more people are going to be able to afford Uber Eats, it's [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3746.1600000000003s)]
*  kind of expensive to use. So consumption is going to go up. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3748.7200000000003s)]
*  And then you think about the optimists. And then what's the [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3751.84s)]
*  other robot company that's making a general human robot [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3754.0800000000004s)]
*  figure figure? And man, those are starting to get really [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3757.6000000000004s)]
*  interesting. And I think that's going to be the unlock. So maybe [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3761.4s)]
*  you could speak a little bit to sacks. What do you think happens [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3765.28s)]
*  when we start getting humanoid robots in the mix? And do you [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3767.92s)]
*  have any investments in that space? [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3770.6s)]
*  I don't because I don't I don't do that kind of hardware R&D. I [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3772.8s)]
*  mean, look, I think you're right that AI does lead to robotics, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3776.1600000000003s)]
*  because one of the hard things about robotics is just having [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3779.2400000000002s)]
*  the robot, not just move, but understand what's happening in [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3784.4s)]
*  the world around it, and then make the right decisions about [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3789.4s)]
*  how to react to that. And so LLMs do start creating a path [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3792.6s)]
*  for the robots to be able to make intelligent decisions [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3798.6s)]
*  without having to be programmed with a bunch of if then [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3802.52s)]
*  statements, right. And I mean, self driving kind of does this [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3806.04s)]
*  too. I mean, self driving is sort of the early. It's kind of [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3809.28s)]
*  like the early prototype for these kinds of robots. And that [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3813.1600000000003s)]
*  s why it's not surprised that Tesla is developing optimists [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3817.2799999999997s)]
*  is because you think about what self driving is, it's, it's a [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3820.04s)]
*  device, a car with a whole bunch of cameras on it, it takes in [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3823.68s)]
*  all that visual information. And then it makes decisions about [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3827.3999999999996s)]
*  how to move and how to react. And then it's trained based on [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3831.04s)]
*  mirroring human decisions, all those human decisions that [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3836.6s)]
*  Tesla has been able to gather through the combination of [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3840.08s)]
*  self driving with humans intervening allows it to train [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3842.0s)]
*  the self driving, I guess, brain you could say, [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3845.8799999999997s)]
*  well, and it's also sacks moving at two or three miles per hour, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3849.16s)]
*  so it can take its time. And if you haven't seen this figure, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3852.3599999999997s)]
*  this combines the language model with what you're discussing [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3855.44s)]
*  sacks. So the language models when you show them a picture, [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3858.48s)]
*  and you say, hey, and this is from figure, and there's this is [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3861.68s)]
*  a their robot and it says, hey, give me something to eat. Have [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3865.7999999999997s)]
*  you guys seen this before? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3868.2s)]
*  I've heard some of the founders, these robotics companies talk [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3869.16s)]
*  about why they create robots in a humanoid shape. And it's not [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3871.64s)]
*  just because they're trying to create a replacement for humans [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3875.44s)]
*  or something like that. It's also because now they can point [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3879.24s)]
*  cameras at the way that humans move. Yes. And so they can [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3882.3199999999997s)]
*  actually train these robots on how humans move and react to [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3885.44s)]
*  things. So you're able to kind of create a large data set kind [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3888.92s)]
*  of like with self driving, so that the robots are able to [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3892.8799999999997s)]
*  learn how to how to move. And I've seen a different video [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3895.72s)]
*  where optimists the Tesla robot is folding shirts. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3899.16s)]
*  Yeah, impressive. Yeah. What's what's really interesting about [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3903.16s)]
*  this freeburg is when I spoke to the people who are making these [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3906.44s)]
*  evolution has made humans to operate in the world most [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3911.68s)]
*  efficiently over whatever number of years and creatures before us. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3917.08s)]
*  So in fact, the world is optimized for the human body [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3922.44s)]
*  type. And so maybe you could talk a little bit about what you [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3927.36s)]
*  think is going to happen with these robots freeburg in the in [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3931.1600000000003s)]
*  the short and medium term, when will we have one of these [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3933.76s)]
*  robots in our houses? What will the price point be in five to [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3936.1600000000003s)]
*  10 years? And what will they be doing in five to 10 years? [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3940.0s)]
*  I don't know. We should explore we should explore that question [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3943.1600000000003s)]
*  at the all in summit 2024. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3945.7200000000003s)]
*  Okay, shout out to Elon Elon, can you bring optimists to the [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3947.7200000000003s)]
*  event, please? [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3952.2000000000003s)]
*  Jason, I don't think it's a five year timeframe. I think it's [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3953.04s)]
*  longer than that. That's just my guess. And one of the reasons [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3955.32s)]
*  is if you look at the use of robots in call it industrial [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3958.28s)]
*  production today, they don't want humans getting too close to [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3963.1600000000003s)]
*  them. They're actually kind of dangerous because you have these [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3966.1200000000003s)]
*  arms flying around, they move quickly, they're very heavy, you [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3968.48s)]
*  get banged on the head by one of them, it's gonna take you out. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3971.96s)]
*  So it's a good idea of having a robot in your house that's capable [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3974.96s)]
*  of freely moving, you have to make that so safe, to a point [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3978.52s)]
*  that they just haven't gotten to yet with robots. So there's [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3983.0s)]
*  just gonna be like a lot of fine tuning work that happens [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3985.2s)]
*  before. This is a domestic product. I think in the near [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3987.8799999999997s)]
*  term, it's all about industrial applications, or maybe even [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3990.8399999999997s)]
*  military applications. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3995.22s)]
*  But if you've ever been to the the giga factories, I was doing [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=3996.68s)]
*  a little tour of one of them once, and somebody grabbed me [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4002.0s)]
*  because I almost wandered into one of those areas and they have [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4004.3599999999997s)]
*  tape on the floor, then they have a wall, etc. But if you [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4007.52s)]
*  even get within a certain closeness with this tape on the [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4010.48s)]
*  floor, it shuts the whole thing down, because they're afraid [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4014.88s)]
*  somebody's gonna get crushed behind one of these arms. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4017.52s)]
*  Chamath, I'll give it to you. When will we have one of these [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4019.6400000000003s)]
*  robots in our homes for the price of a Prius? Now, by the [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4023.1600000000003s)]
*  way, Prius is a car that costs about $50,000 that common folk [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4027.6400000000003s)]
*  drive. So $50,000 robot in our houses. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4032.08s)]
*  I think it'll be less than that. I think it's going to be in the [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4036.48s)]
*  next two or three years, you'll have a domestic help robot that [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4038.88s)]
*  you can probably pay 1000 bucks a month for. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4042.6600000000003s)]
*  Okay, which would be two to three, like $100,000 car [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4045.2000000000003s)]
*  payment. That would be the equivalent of a car payment on [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4048.32s)]
*  $100,000 car. So okay, you say under five, you say three, what [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4050.4s)]
*  do you think free break same bet? $1,000 a month robot [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4054.6s)]
*  $100,000 sticker price. When we have that in our homes? [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4057.8s)]
*  No, I think it's 1000 a month, 1000 a month, which would be [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4061.48s)]
*  the equivalent over whatever number of months. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4065.2400000000002s)]
*  What is it? It does it's general purpose. Those different [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4067.2000000000003s)]
*  general purses robot $1,000 a month, 50 payments. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4070.0s)]
*  I think it washes the dishes. I think it will do the laundry, [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4073.4799999999996s)]
*  take out the trash. There'll be like a whole set of house household [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4077.4399999999996s)]
*  tasks that it will do. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4080.6s)]
*  Walk the dog. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4082.56s)]
*  No, no, not responsible for a life creature. What do you say [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4084.68s)]
*  free birth $1,000 a month at home robot does your dishes. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4088.04s)]
*  There's a great bet for us. Give us the over under how many [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4091.7599999999998s)]
*  years free. I'm not sure I think the salt of science Come on, [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4094.8399999999997s)]
*  man, give us a year. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4098.16s)]
*  Well, I don't think it necessarily follows this general [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4099.599999999999s)]
*  purpose model. I think that there are likely going to be [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4102.56s)]
*  more [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4106.320000000001s)]
*  narrow [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4108.96s)]
*  application ranges. And they're not going to necessarily be [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4110.88s)]
*  humanoid in form factor. I don't know if you guys have seen a [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4114.8s)]
*  gecko robotics. We got seen this company. Are you guys investors [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4120.56s)]
*  in this? Nope. Pretty impressive, like suite of autonomous [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4123.0s)]
*  products that do specific things in industrial settings. So [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4130.32s)]
*  they have like robots that climb on the outside of buildings and [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4134.32s)]
*  look for cracks using special scanning equipment, but they're [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4138.84s)]
*  very autonomous and how they operate and what they can do. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4142.28s)]
*  And they've got a whole class of robots that can then be each one [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4144.719999999999s)]
*  of those robots can do many different tasks for many [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4148.16s)]
*  different applications. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4151.24s)]
*  And so the form factors, they've got kind of a set of form [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4153.5199999999995s)]
*  factors, meaning a set of robots that look differently, and have [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4157.24s)]
*  different capabilities of them like little spider legs or arms [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4160.44s)]
*  or whatever. And then they can be applied to go do something [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4163.599999999999s)]
*  autonomously. And then they just run and they do it. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4168.28s)]
*  Pull that up. You'll see climbing walls, riding along [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4170.12s)]
*  types. Yeah, they're built. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4173.679999999999s)]
*  Well, they're not purpose. That's what's interesting. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4176.599999999999s)]
*  They're they're sort of a narrow range of applications, but [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4178.24s)]
*  they're not specific to do only one thing. And so they can work [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4182.719999999999s)]
*  in different environments and do different things. And so you'll [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4186.8s)]
*  kind of pick from their suite of robots, which ones you want to [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4189.88s)]
*  use to do different, different tasks, and then they go and do [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4193.28s)]
*  it. It's really interesting. They're mostly using them for [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4196.52s)]
*  industrial monitoring applications right now, like [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4198.72s)]
*  looking on bridges for breaks and [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4200.64s)]
*  Yeah, check cleaning, cleaning, cleaning windows here. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4202.72s)]
*  Yeah, cleaning windows, all that kind of stuff. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4205.2s)]
*  Ooh, cleaning windows. That's a good [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4207.24s)]
*  Yeah. So they've got like a really cool suite. And I think [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4208.88s)]
*  that's what we're likely to see in domestic settings as well. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4211.24s)]
*  All right, so you [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4214.320000000001s)]
*  I just, I'm just not sure. By the way, I will say the success of [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4214.92s)]
*  gecko indicates that there's far more money to be made in [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4219.12s)]
*  industrial applications and there isn't consumer applications [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4223.92s)]
*  today. I disagree. Yeah, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4227.160000000001s)]
*  I think every human is going to have one of these. I think every [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4230.0s)]
*  household in America, every middle class household in [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4232.72s)]
*  America will have one of these $1,000 a month robots in seven [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4235.68s)]
*  years. I'll give it seven. You say you [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4238.88s)]
*  everything, I say to do domestic chores, taking out the trash, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4242.04s)]
*  folding laundry, domestic tasks. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4247.5599999999995s)]
*  I just think it's hard to justify that because you're only [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4250.04s)]

*  really worth 1000 bucks a month? Whereas in the industrial [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4255.32s)]
*  setting, it makes a lot more sense. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4258.759999999999s)]
*  Think about those dangerous tasks like climbing on a bridge [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4260.16s)]
*  looking at the seams and climbing on a building cleaning [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4262.5199999999995s)]
*  the windows. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4265.839999999999s)]
*  Those tasks take years to do sometimes. Many, many years of [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4266.5199999999995s)]
*  high risk human labor. Whereas taking out the trash and folding [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4270.72s)]
*  laundry might be a little bit more hard to justify the spend. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4274.88s)]
*  Or it's more breaking news here during the program. We'll get [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4277.56s)]
*  our work correspondent our geopolitical expert David Sacks. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4281.8s)]
*  What are you seeing on the wire, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4286.280000000001s)]
*  sack? [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4287.360000000001s)]
*  Well, there's a NATO meeting going on right now. And Blinken [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4288.68s)]
*  did a press conference where he says that Ukraine will be [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4291.04s)]
*  joining NATO. That's the big news going viral right now. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4293.56s)]
*  Ukraine will become a member of NATO. Our purpose at the summit [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4297.88s)]
*  is to help build a bridge to that membership and to create a [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4303.88s)]
*  clear pathway for for Ukraine moving forward. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4309.2s)]
*  So of course, we believe that Ukraine deserves to be a member [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4313.6s)]
*  of NATO and that this should happen sooner rather sooner [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4317.6s)]
*  sooner rather than later. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4320.8s)]
*  Chamath, any thoughts on this flip that just broke during the [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4322.2s)]
*  program? [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4326.88s)]
*  Well, we just I think NATO just added Sweden, right? And it was [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4328.8s)]
*  done in pretty record time from application to admission. So I [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4333.8s)]
*  would like to know whether is this just rhetoric to just keep [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4338.92s)]
*  everybody at bay and placate the Ukrainians? Or is this real? The [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4342.28s)]
*  problem that this creates is that if it is real, and they're [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4348.400000000001s)]
*  admitted, then NATO has to defend Ukraine, which means [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4352.12s)]
*  that then America and all the other NATO allies would have to [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4357.24s)]
*  fight, which means that we're in a war, America should not be in [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4361.92s)]
*  a war. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4365.92s)]
*  Just give you the exact facts. You are correct. Sweden Finland [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4366.5199999999995s)]
*  applied to join in May 2022. Following Russia's invasion of [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4369.76s)]
*  Ukraine, and they had been neutral, as you know, for many [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4375.0s)]
*  decades, Finland has a massive land border with Russia. And [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4378.08s)]
*  they joined in April of 2023 after applying in May of 22. So [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4382.92s)]
*  just a year later, and Sweden became a member in March of 2024. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4386.92s)]
*  Just two years later, efforts membership was held up by both [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4390.24s)]
*  Turkey and Hungary. Sax, you're our resident expert on Ukraine [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4394.48s)]
*  and all things geopolitical. Your thoughts? [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4398.64s)]
*  On the one hand, what Lincoln is saying is more of the same here [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4400.92s)]
*  because it's been the administration's policy to seek [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4403.86s)]
*  to bring Ukraine into NATO since they took office, they've [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4406.32s)]
*  reiterated that over and over again. And it's one of the major [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4410.5199999999995s)]
*  reasons for this war is that the Russians said over and over [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4414.28s)]
*  again, this was a red line for them. That's why there's a war [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4417.08s)]
*  in Ukraine. The idea that you're going to be able to bring Ukraine [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4419.5199999999995s)]
*  into NATO. However, when the war is going so badly, is now [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4423.24s)]
*  entering the territory of being delusional. I mean, this is like [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4427.88s)]
*  a delusional comment. And if you just want to understand how [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4431.88s)]
*  badly things are going, look at yesterday's Politico, which was [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4435.12s)]
*  called Ukraine is at great risk of its front lines collapsing. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4438.36s)]
*  The source for this article was high ranking Ukrainian officials [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4442.04s)]
*  close to Zaluzhny, who's the former commander in chief. Some [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4446.88s)]
*  people have speculated that Zaluzhny himself might be the [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4450.599999999999s)]
*  source, but at a minimum, it's high ranking Ukrainian officers [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4453.24s)]
*  who reported to Zaluzhny. And what they say in this article is [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4457.12s)]
*  that the prognosis in Ukraine is grim. They say that the sad [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4461.04s)]
*  truth is that even if the funding bills approved by the [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4465.76s)]
*  US Congress, a massive resupply may not be enough to prevent a [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4468.88s)]
*  major battlefield upset. They say that there is a great risk [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4472.4s)]
*  of the front lines collapsing wherever Russian generals decide [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4475.64s)]
*  to focus their offensive, which people expect in the next few [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4479.04s)]
*  months. And there's nothing that can help Ukraine now because [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4481.8s)]
*  there are no serious technologies able to compensate [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4485.88s)]
*  Ukraine for the large mass of troops Russia is likely to hurl [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4488.72s)]
*  at us. This is a quote from one of the Ukrainian officials. We [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4492.76s)]
*  don't have those technologies and the West doesn't have them as [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4496.96s)]
*  well in sufficient numbers. So what they're saying is that even [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4500.240000000001s)]
*  if the funding bill goes through the 61 billion, it's not going [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4504.280000000001s)]
*  to be enough to save Ukraine. And at the very moment that that [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4508.4400000000005s)]
*  is now being finally honestly reported by Western media, it's [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4512.52s)]
*  something I've been saying now for months. Finally, the truth [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4516.96s)]
*  is coming out. You have Blinken doubling and tripling down on [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4520.04s)]
*  these comments that nevertheless, Ukraine will be [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4523.4400000000005s)]
*  joining NATO. And Chamath is right under Article 5, an attack [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4525.6s)]
*  on one is an attack on all. Therefore, if Ukraine becomes [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4529.0s)]
*  part of NATO, an attack on Ukraine by Russia, which is [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4532.88s)]
*  currently ongoing, will be considered an attack on the [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4536.32s)]
*  United States. Then you have to add to the mix the fact that [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4538.76s)]
*  Macron and other European leaders have actually been [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4542.08s)]
*  advocating for NATO descending round troops. And he said this [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4544.88s)]
*  over and over again, he's doubled down on this multiple [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4548.4400000000005s)]
*  times. So you have a dynamic now where this isn't just hot [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4551.36s)]
*  rhetoric by Blinken. This really has the risk of tipping over [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4555.36s)]
*  into policy, I would say in a Biden second term, where Biden [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4560.52s)]
*  agrees to do what our European allies are already calling for, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4565.28s)]
*  which is sending NATO troops to Ukraine, to save Ukraine from [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4569.400000000001s)]
*  what Politico calls an imminent collapse. I think this is a [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4573.88s)]
*  very dangerous situation. I mean, we're really talking about [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4577.4800000000005s)]
*  here is World War Three. So if you want to have a serious [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4579.64s)]
*  chance of World War Three in the next four years, then I would [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4583.92s)]
*  say go ahead and vote for Biden in November. I mean, this is [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4585.96s)]
*  just very clear to me. I'm personally not willing to accept [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4588.36s)]
*  that risk. I'm not willing to accept a 10% or 1% risk of that [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4590.88s)]
*  chance. But I think Blinken putting it on the table here, I [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4594.4400000000005s)]
*  think people should be deeply concerned about this. And there [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4597.92s)]
*  should be a lot of follow up questions for Blinken and the [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4601.08s)]
*  administration about this. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4603.8s)]
*  Freeburg, should the free country of Ukraine be able to [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4605.0s)]
*  join NATO on some timeline? Or should they be banned from ever [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4609.4800000000005s)]
*  joining? [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4613.96s)]
*  I think the statements are correct that Ukraine joining [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4616.08s)]
*  NATO escalates conflict, and we will find ourselves in a de [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4618.96s)]
*  facto global conflict, World War. Now, the question is, is [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4622.52s)]
*  that the cycle, the natural cycle, I will once again, Nick, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4631.4s)]
*  pull it up, please reference Ray Dalio is typical big cycle [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4635.5199999999995s)]
*  behind empires rise and decline. As he spoke at length with us [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4640.36s)]
*  in person about at the All In Summit last year, he points out [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4645.44s)]
*  that the era of prosperity that over the last 500 years, we've [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4649.44s)]
*  seen six major empires go through is followed by a debt [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4654.2s)]
*  bubble, which drives a wealth gap, which ultimately leads to [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4658.44s)]
*  economic challenges, which means printing more money, which is [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4664.32s)]
*  the cycle we are going through right now, with a, as you guys [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4666.96s)]
*  know, two to $3 trillion annual deficit and explosion in federal [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4670.879999999999s)]
*  debt levels. And that ultimately leads inevitably to external [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4675.96s)]
*  conflict to war. Now, the particular motivations in every [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4680.5199999999995s)]
*  case in all six times this has happened in the last 500 years, [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4685.08s)]
*  look different when you read the history books about what were [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4688.8s)]
*  the circumstances that drove us to external conflict that drove [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4692.48s)]
*  that nation to war. But the truth is, every single one of [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4695.64s)]
*  them was preceded by a debt bubble, income inequality, [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4699.96s)]
*  wealth gap, and the printing of money. And there's a relationship [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4704.92s)]
*  between those economic factors and a desire for conflict. And I [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4709.28s)]
*  think that is what we are seeing play out over the past couple of [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4713.2s)]
*  years, starting with our motivated interest in supporting [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4716.0s)]
*  Ukraine against the Russia conflict, and now escalating it [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4721.5599999999995s)]
*  towards inviting Ukraine to join NATO to escalate the conflict [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4725.76s)]
*  itself. Now, I think there's a notion that having a war is [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4729.0s)]
*  stimulating, having a war is unifying. This would be having a [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4735.08s)]

*  to print money to support the economy, and or to bridge the [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4749.719999999999s)]
*  wealth gap. And when under those circumstances, in order to [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4752.92s)]
*  unify the country in order to motivate a system of unification [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4756.0s)]
*  amongst a fracturing society or fracturing economic strata, you [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4761.12s)]
*  feel like you have to have an external enemy, and that the [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4766.639999999999s)]
*  notion of war itself is economically stimulating. I think [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4770.2s)]
*  that those are the motivating factors that we've seen play [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4774.48s)]
*  out six times in the last 500 years. And we may be [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4776.92s)]
*  unfortunately seeing play out here again, as we talked to [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4780.4s)]
*  Graham Allison, Ray Dalio about last year, we said, what can we [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4783.2s)]
*  do to avoid this that there have been times historically, where [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4787.28s)]
*  these things have been avoided. But if we're not being cognizant [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4790.96s)]
*  of what's going on here, and motivating a different tact and [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4794.84s)]
*  different path, whether it's through our electoral cycle, or [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4799.36s)]
*  through being loud and vocal in whatever media channels we each [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4803.5599999999995s)]
*  have access to, to make folks more aware of this. I think, you [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4807.679999999999s)]
*  know, we will find ourselves walking down this path of [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4812.2s)]
*  looking for global conflict and finding it. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4814.92s)]
*  Jamath, you look like you wanted to chime in there. Yeah. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4817.36s)]
*  Of the three presidential candidates, to be very clear, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4820.4s)]
*  one is supportive, then, of some kind of confrontation, because [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4822.88s)]
*  by proxy, they're supportive of admitting Ukraine into NATO, [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4829.96s)]
*  which would create a war and two are pretty clearly anti war. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4833.400000000001s)]
*  And just for people who know the boom bust cycle behind empires [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4836.400000000001s)]
*  rise and declines, you can see that if you're on the YouTube [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4840.16s)]
*  video, but the sixth of eight moments is revolutions and wars, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4843.8s)]
*  as Freiburg's pointing out, there are two more that come [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4848.92s)]
*  after that, debt and political restructuring, and then the New [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4851.24s)]
*  World Order emerges. And so the question here, I guess becomes, [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4855.599999999999s)]
*  can diplomacy win the day? And then is Blinken's point that they [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4859.599999999999s)]
*  eventually can become a member or that they're imminently going [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4864.28s)]
*  to become a member and it's breaking news. So we don't know [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4867.32s)]
*  if he's speaking about clearly, let's just be really clear on [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4870.24s)]
*  this, the words he used were very carefully chosen. And that [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4874.36s)]
*  means that there was a media and press strategy conversation [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4878.08s)]
*  that was had by him and his staff, which obviously found its [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4881.88s)]
*  way into the White House administration and that there was [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4885.8s)]
*  a executive conversation about this. For sure. This is the [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4889.0s)]
*  positioning we need to now be clearly stating, which means [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4892.32s)]
*  that this is now policy. He did not slip up on those words. This [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4896.04s)]
*  was not some off the cuff comment. This was clearly a [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4899.28s)]
*  media trained statement, which means that it is it is [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4903.28s)]
*  administration. Exactly. At the next White House press [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4906.6s)]
*  conference, you will hear the question asked by reporters. Is [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4911.280000000001s)]
*  this the White House position? And they will say yes, it is. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4914.6s)]
*  Yeah. And just to be clear, that that video had a couple of edits [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4918.4400000000005s)]
*  in it. And we don't have the full press conference here. The [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4921.160000000001s)]
*  quote from the Hill is Ukraine will become a member of NATO [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4923.84s)]
*  period. Our purpose at the summit is to help build a bridge [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4926.64s)]
*  to that membership, which then seems like this, this, if you're [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4930.4800000000005s)]
*  building a bridge that takes time. So maybe they mean over [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4934.24s)]
*  time, the fullness of time, to be able to do this in the next [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4938.0s)]
*  year would be if it was on the timeline of Finland would be [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4942.639999999999s)]
*  insane. I cannot say but they're not ruling it out. And I think [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4945.8s)]
*  you have to look at the context of what's happening. He's making [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4949.88s)]
*  these remarks, as all the news from the battlefield is terrible. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4952.48s)]
*  Ukraine is losing and it's at risk of collapsing. And European [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4957.76s)]
*  leaders like Macron are therefore calling for direct NATO [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4962.16s)]
*  intervention in the war. So for Lincoln to be making this sort of [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4966.36s)]
*  statement is really adding fuel to the fire. And let's see if he [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4970.5199999999995s)]
*  walks it back. Let's see if he clarifies it. I predict that he [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4973.5599999999995s)]
*  won't because this is a clarification for sure, because [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4976.12s)]
*  this does not feel like it'd be good for voting because the war [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4979.04s)]
*  is incredibly unpopular. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4981.92s)]
*  It'll make the election pretty simple. Every other issue, all [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4983.72s)]
*  the social issues that we fight about will fall away. The debt [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4987.12s)]
*  will fall away. The border will fall away if this is true. If [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4990.52s)]
*  it's true, does America want to go to war? [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4994.360000000001s)]
*  Well, Chamath, I think I think we're already at that point, even [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4997.4800000000005s)]
*  if there is some sort of clarification. And the reason I [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=4999.92s)]
*  say that is because Biden clearly is very committed to [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5002.280000000001s)]
*  this Ukraine policy. It didn't just start when he became [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5005.700000000001s)]
*  president, it started when he became vice president, and was [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5008.280000000001s)]
*  managing the Ukraine portfolio for Obama. This is why Hunter [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5011.52s)]
*  Biden got that job in Ukraine, because Biden was running the [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5015.160000000001s)]
*  show there. And they have been very committed to this idea of [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5018.28s)]
*  bringing Ukraine into NATO for decades. I mean, he supported [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5021.4s)]
*  when he was a senator. So this is not like Friedberg said, this [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5024.759999999999s)]
*  is not like to some randomly chosen words out of the blue. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5027.88s)]
*  Blinken measures his words carefully. He knows what he's [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5030.92s)]
*  saying. And this is something that Biden clearly is passionate [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5033.96s)]
*  about. And what you have to believe is that in a Biden [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5038.599999999999s)]
*  second term, he's going to manage this whole situation so [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5041.599999999999s)]
*  perfectly, that this war is not going to escalate any further. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5045.28s)]
*  And I just I have no confidence in that. Remember, if you want [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5048.719999999999s)]
*  to use a historical analogy, go back to Woodrow Wilson in 1916. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5052.179999999999s)]
*  He was elected on literally the catchphrase, he kept us out of [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5056.5599999999995s)]
*  war. Less than one year later, we were in World War One. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5060.32s)]
*  World War One. Yeah. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5064.639999999999s)]
*  So this idea of well, Biden wouldn't possibly get us into a [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5065.719999999999s)]
*  war. I mean, history shows otherwise. History shows that [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5069.8s)]
*  presidents once they win re-election are more likely to [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5074.4s)]
*  get us into war, rather than less, because they don't have to [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5078.24s)]
*  fear voters. So then the question is, well, what is in [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5081.28s)]
*  Joe Biden's heart? What's he passionate about? He is clearly [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5085.2s)]
*  passionate about this cause, about bringing Ukraine into NATO, [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5088.5199999999995s)]
*  and certainly not having Ukraine collapse or lose this war. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5093.0s)]
*  Whereas Trump and Bobby Kennedy have both said that they will [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5096.68s)]
*  end this war, they will seek a peace deal if elected. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5100.0s)]
*  I think that's enough right there. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5105.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, and obviously, Lincoln and Biden are looking [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5106.92s)]
*  for peace as well. They just don't want to lose the war. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5109.4s)]
*  No, they're not looking for peace. I disagree with that. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5112.12s)]
*  I think they are definitely for peace. You can disagree. But [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5114.08s)]
*  they're really want peace. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5116.44s)]
*  Why did they reject the deal at Istanbul at the beginning of this [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5117.4s)]
*  war? [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5119.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, because they, I think, don't want Russia to determine [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5120.2s)]
*  who gets to be in NATO, and they want free countries to decide. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5123.8s)]
*  Is that what you're going to war for? [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5126.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, that is, I guess the existential question here is, at [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5128.68s)]
*  what point do we want to let free democracies determine their [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5132.0s)]
*  future and protect them from invading countries? That is, [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5135.44s)]
*  like, actually, the core of this is, do you believe in [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5138.36s)]
*  democracy? Do you believe free countries should have the [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5140.96s)]
*  autonomy to pick their future? And is that worth fighting for? [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5144.08s)]
*  That is the question the world faces right now. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5147.92s)]
*  I think that framing, I think that framing is not totally [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5150.16s)]
*  accurate. I think, of course, those things are good and right [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5153.28s)]
*  things. I think the thing is, on the balance of issues, there are [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5155.8s)]
*  seasons when certain priorities need to be shaped by a country. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5160.16s)]
*  And right now, we're in a season where there's tremendous [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5164.72s)]
*  domestic instability. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5169.639999999999s)]
*  In our country? [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5171.44s)]
*  And, and our balance sheet is breaking. So I think the [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5172.639999999999s)]
*  question isn't that is democracy important? Of course, it's [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5178.16s)]
*  important. It's how relatively important is it abroad, relative [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5180.8s)]
*  to these domestic issues here? [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5186.88s)]
*  Yeah, that I never hold on to let me just finish it. Is it [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5188.96s)]
*  worth fighting for is the issue? And is it worth fighting for [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5193.0s)]
*  when you don't have the resources to do it? Now, if we [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5196.360000000001s)]
*  were sitting here, and a country next to Ukraine was invaded, say [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5198.68s)]
*  Finland, or say France or another country in Europe was [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5203.4800000000005s)]
*  invaded, we would absolutely go to bat for them. But for [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5206.72s)]
*  Ukraine, we won't go to bat for them. They're not part of NATO. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5210.4800000000005s)]
*  And you know, this is [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5213.96s)]
*  when you say, are you saying, are you saying send American [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5215.52s)]
*  soldiers? Because that's what we're talking about. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5218.4s)]
*  If France or Finland was in, would you be opposed if France [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5220.16s)]
*  was if Russia invaded France, would you defend France? Would [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5223.08s)]
*  you be in favor of the course? [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5226.0s)]
*  That's our article five. That's our article five guarantee under [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5227.5199999999995s)]
*  NATO. This is why I don't want to extend an article five [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5230.16s)]
*  guarantee to Ukraine, because it will put us directly in [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5232.24s)]
*  conflict with Russia. And I'm not interested in being in war [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5234.679999999999s)]
*  three. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5238.04s)]
*  Right. And then so Finland and Sweden come up, and I guess the [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5238.759999999999s)]
*  argument would be, would you be in favor of sending troops to [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5241.5199999999995s)]
*  defend Finland and Sweden, the latest members of NATO? And would [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5244.5599999999995s)]
*  you be in favor of them? [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5246.839999999999s)]
*  We're committed. Now we're committed. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5247.8s)]
*  And when you were in favor of them joining NATO, I guess is [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5249.400000000001s)]
*  the next question. Should we discuss it on the pod? I explained [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5251.76s)]
*  that it was creating a liability and on an asset, but what's done [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5254.28s)]
*  is done. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5256.72s)]
*  Should free countries be able to join NATO, I guess is at the [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5257.2s)]
*  end of the question. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5260.28s)]
*  Excellent question. Actually, let me make two points on that. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5261.12s)]
*  The first one is countries don't have a right to join NATO any [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5263.56s)]
*  more than I have a right to join Augusta country club. Just because [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5267.52s)]
*  I'm a golf player doesn't mean I get to join Augusta. Okay, it's [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5270.92s)]
*  the current membership of Augusta or NATO decide whether [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5274.08s)]
*  they're going to admit a country based on what is in their [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5279.16s)]
*  interests. It has never been in our interest to make Ukraine [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5281.68s)]
*  security dependent of the United States. Sorry, this is the [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5285.32s)]
*  reality. The second thing I want to point out is that what was [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5287.88s)]
*  Russia demanding? They were demanding Ukrainian neutrality. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5292.2s)]
*  They were not basically looking to conquer Ukraine. They wanted [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5296.08s)]
*  them to be neutral. So Ukraine did not have to give up its [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5300.92s)]
*  freedom. Okay, they just had to agree to be neutral. That was [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5304.92s)]
*  the key issue. That's what makes it very different than some [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5309.0s)]
*  other historical analogies. And that was unacceptable to us at [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5311.6s)]
*  the very beginning of the war. Blinken said that we would insist [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5315.24s)]
*  on an open door policy. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5319.04s)]
*  We would clearly the right move here would have been to kick the [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5320.12s)]
*  can down the road and just tell Putin, we'll take it off. We'll [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5322.6s)]
*  take NATO off the table for 10 years or 20 years. And then we [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5325.4400000000005s)]
*  could have outlasted Putin. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5328.28s)]
*  You have much better read on that before the war started. And [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5330.96s)]
*  then the minute the war started, everyone forgot that that was [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5333.8s)]
*  the key casus belli of this war. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5336.2s)]
*  Just more diplomacy is better. Can I just say one thing that [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5338.76s)]
*  sacks you would be the perfect member of Augusta were it not for [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5343.24s)]
*  one small issue. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5347.96s)]
*  Ryan Smith, snush. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Zzlgo-xZM&t=5351.52s)]
