# In conversation with President Trump
**All In Podcast:** [June 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU)
*  Here we go. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=0.0s)]
*  Hello, Mr. President. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3.36s)]
*  Hey, Tam, I love that house he has. I love David's house. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4.32s)]
*  That made the biggest impression. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=8.88s)]
*  Thank you, sir. I heard you have a pretty nice house too. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=11.52s)]
*  Yeah, I have. We're in a nice house. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=14.72s)]
*  We like houses. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=16.96s)]
*  It's only worth 18 million, right? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=17.52s)]
*  I know. The judge said 18 million people said Palm Beach has gone down a long way. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=18.96s)]
*  Hello, everybody. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=25.36s)]
*  Rain Man, David Sack. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=30.8s)]
*  And instead, we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=35.2s)]
*  Love you, besties. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=38.96s)]
*  Thanks so much for sitting down with us, Mr. President. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  The All In Pod is basically the four of us having conversations. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=46.0s)]
*  It's kind of a spectrum of different views. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=49.04s)]
*  We got sort of like a little bit of some Fox News and then some MSDNC at the same time. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=51.36s)]
*  Oh, that's okay. Keeps it interesting. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=56.08s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=59.52s)]
*  Anyway, Chamath and I, we had a great time at the fundraiser that we did a couple weeks ago. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=60.88s)]
*  I think it turned out great. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=65.84s)]
*  And I heard the Winklevoss brothers are actually announcing that they're donating [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=68.56s)]
*  a million dollars each in Bitcoin to you tomorrow. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=73.04s)]
*  So I think that's a great result to come out of it as well. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=76.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Got to meet them for the first time at your house and terrific. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=80.56s)]
*  They did well. They might have started the whole thing. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=88.64s)]
*  I don't know if that court case was proper, but they were very nice, both of them. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=90.08s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=94.72s)]
*  Really nice guys. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=95.44s)]
*  And I think maybe this is a good place to start in our conversation is, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=96.72s)]
*  one of the things I think we heard a lot at that dinner was just the difficulty [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=100.72s)]
*  that people in business were having under this Biden administration. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  You got the crypto guys who just want a framework. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=109.2s)]
*  They just want the government to tell them how to operate and they can't get that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=112.08s)]
*  You got no M&A happening right now in tech. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=116.64s)]
*  The real estate guys, they can't get loans because the interest rates [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=120.4s)]
*  are through the roof and there's a credit crunch. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=123.92s)]
*  So I think one of the common themes we just heard across that dinner was [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=126.16s)]
*  that it was just so hard to do business right now. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=130.24s)]
*  And I guess maybe a good place to start would just be, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=133.76s)]
*  what's the number one thing or maybe the top three things that you would do [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=136.88s)]
*  to kind of get things moving again if you're reelected? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=140.0s)]
*  So I'd say regulation, regulation and taxes. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=145.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=148.96s)]
*  You know, I gave the biggest tax cut in the history of our country a lot to business. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=149.68s)]
*  It took them down from, look, as you know, they were paying people, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=154.08s)]
*  companies were paying 40%, 45%, including state and city taxes in many cases. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=158.16s)]
*  And we got it down to 21%. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=164.32s)]
*  We'd like to get it down lower actually, but we got it down and the revenues were [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=166.32s)]
*  better than ever. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=171.2s)]
*  Even with the lower rate, we had record revenues, which tells you a little bit about that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=172.24s)]
*  But also the regulations. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=178.08s)]
*  And when I asked a lot of people, a lot of big people, a lot of corporate types, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=180.88s)]
*  big corporate types, I said, if you had your choice between just the taxes or just the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=184.96s)]
*  regulations, where did I do better? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=188.72s)]
*  He said the regulations. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=191.12s)]
*  I was the biggest cutter of regular. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=192.32000000000002s)]
*  In four years, I cut more regulations than anybody by far, by far, not even close. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=194.32000000000002s)]
*  And when I spoke to different people about the regulation versus the taxes, I don't [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=200.48s)]
*  think I've ever had anybody say and the taxes were a massive cut, you know, from 37%, 38%. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=206.08s)]
*  If you look at it just there to 21%, I don't think I ever had anybody say that the taxes [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=212.32s)]
*  were more important than the regulation cuts. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=217.84s)]
*  I made it possible to build. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=220.08s)]
*  I made it possible to do things, to invest. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=222.0s)]
*  I was able to get companies with a lot of money outside of the USA to bring that money [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=224.64s)]
*  back in. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  You know, we cut the rate and it was crazy. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=230.72s)]
*  The rate was like 55%. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=233.2s)]
*  So that means if they bring the money back, they lose half their money before they even [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  start. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=238.48s)]
*  But it was also impossible from a standpoint, a structural standpoint, a legal standpoint. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=239.2s)]
*  It was very hard. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=244.88s)]
*  And they were able to bring back. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=246.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean, Apple's an example. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=247.83999999999997s)]
*  They brought hundreds of billions of dollars back from other countries into the United [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=249.11999999999998s)]
*  States and invested it here. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=253.84s)]
*  But it's very interesting because I ask the question all the time, which was more important? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=256.88s)]
*  And almost everybody said I did an even better job. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  And I got the biggest tax cuts, the biggest tax cuts, bigger than the Reagan tax cuts, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=264.16s)]
*  but they found regulations and the regulation cuts were even more effective. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=268.96s)]
*  And that's where we had the great economy and that's where we had the most jobs ever produced. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=273.92s)]
*  So there's this odd thing that happens in certain states where taxes keep going up and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=278.16s)]
*  then you start to see the states break, right? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=283.52s)]
*  Productivity breaks, crime goes up and quality of life goes down. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=286.16s)]
*  But then people don't understand that taxation and all of those things are correlated. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=290.32s)]
*  Do you have an idea of why that is? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=295.36s)]
*  Why don't people understand universally that lower taxation is better for productivity? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=297.12s)]
*  Well, they don't understand it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=302.4s)]
*  And it's such an interesting question because you look at some of these places like Chicago [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=303.68s)]
*  and New York and LA and so many more. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=308.72s)]
*  I'd hate to even mention the three because there are worse examples than that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=312.32s)]
*  You look at what's happened in Oakland and you look at what's happened into [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=315.52s)]
*  some cities that are disappearing. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=318.88s)]
*  I mean, they're literally just crime waves. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=320.4s)]
*  Nobody lives there except for criminals because you can't live there. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=323.44s)]
*  You can't survive there. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=327.04s)]
*  Physically, you can't survive there. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=328.96000000000004s)]
*  And when you look at the kind of crime that we're talking about and then they take the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=331.12s)]
*  power away from the police, the police can't do anything. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=334.8s)]
*  If they do anything to stop it, they end up losing their pension, their house, their family. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  They end up losing everything. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=341.36s)]
*  They get put in jail. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=342.96s)]
*  And we're not talking about the rogue cops who do something really bad and should be [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=344.96s)]
*  taken care of badly. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=349.52s)]
*  You know, be nasty. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=351.36s)]
*  You got to be nasty to them also. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=352.24s)]
*  But mostly, I mean, these people, they want to really like 99 percent, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=354.24s)]
*  they want to stop crime. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=359.76s)]
*  They hate to see it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=360.8s)]
*  They're not allowed to even they're told not to do anything. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=361.76s)]
*  When you see a department store that was so proud, they opened up a new store in a [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  certain city and all of a sudden this over the last couple of years has happened, this [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=368.56s)]
*  phenomena where 500 usually young people walk into the store and take everything. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=372.8s)]
*  They have masks on. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=378.96s)]
*  They walk out with television sets, air conditioners. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=380.4s)]
*  They walk out with everything. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=382.96s)]
*  This is a new phenomena that's taken place and it's incredible. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=384.8s)]
*  Look at drug stores. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=389.36s)]
*  Look at what's going on. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=390.4s)]
*  Like in New York, you walk into a chain. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  I've seen it twice. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=393.28s)]
*  I don't walk into too many drug stores, but I used to love it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=394.64s)]
*  I used to love to walk around and just look at what it is, whether it's a drug store or [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=398.0s)]
*  department store. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=402.15999999999997s)]
*  But they told me just a little while ago, I had a meeting with some people and they [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=403.2s)]
*  say you walk into a drug store in New York and everything's covered up with bars and [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  glass. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=410.56s)]
*  And if you want just a little thing of aspirin or if you want to buy a toothbrush, you have [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=411.2s)]
*  to wait a half an hour to get a clerk and they open up this vault and they give you [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=415.76s)]
*  a toothbrush. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=420.56s)]
*  Or they give you it's how do you do business like that? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=421.28s)]
*  This is a phenomenon. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  There's never been anything like this. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=426.08s)]
*  They didn't use to have theft of even the most minor items. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=427.44s)]
*  They had very little theft, relatively speaking. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  They didn't have theft, but they had the police would arrest them if they did something. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=434.24s)]
*  Today they don't. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=438.4s)]
*  They have limits sometimes. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=439.36s)]
*  If you steal less than $2,000, you don't get arrested. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=440.88s)]
*  So nobody steals more than $2,000. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=444.4s)]
*  It's incredible when you see what's happened to the quality of life in our country. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=447.28s)]
*  And it's happened so quickly. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=451.2s)]
*  It's taken place so rapidly. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  Nobody's ever seen anything. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=454.96s)]
*  But you look at retail and I know the big deal. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=456.8s)]
*  It used to be a big deal when a department store moved into a city or a certain store [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=459.12s)]
*  opened up even in a town. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  But it's usually the Democrat run big cities where this problem is taking place. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=466.24s)]
*  And I don't say that as a Republican. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=471.68s)]
*  I just say you look at the 25 cities, the top problems, they're just about all Democrat. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=473.2s)]
*  They're Democrat run. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=480.15999999999997s)]
*  And they're also high tax, high regulation states. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=481.52s)]
*  Yeah, no cash bail. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=484.24s)]
*  All these different things that have taken place. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=485.68s)]
*  They're phenomena. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=487.68s)]
*  It's a phenomena. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=488.71999999999997s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  Nobody's ever seen anything like it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=491.44s)]
*  And it has to be stopped. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=493.68s)]
*  It's a horrible quality of life. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=495.28s)]
*  And on top of that, you can't walk to a store, you end up getting shot or mugged or something. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=497.28s)]
*  The level of crime in the cities, in these big cities is out of control. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=502.32s)]
*  Nobody has ever seen anything like it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=506.88s)]
*  Mr. President, can I just ask on your point about the tax cuts? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  Larry Summers made a comment the other day and I thought maybe you could respond to his tweet [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=513.12s)]
*  that the tax cuts coupled with the tariffs that you've proposed would cause a massive, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=517.84s)]
*  I think he called it the mother of all stagflation, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=523.84s)]
*  where you would have kind of inflation because of the tariffs, you would have economic decline, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=526.72s)]
*  because more money would start to fund an increase in prices with tax coming down, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=531.28s)]
*  tax cuts being put in place. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=536.16s)]
*  Can you maybe just comment on the comment made by Larry Summers [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=537.4399999999999s)]
*  and how we implement tax cuts without inflation? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=542.24s)]
*  Well, let me say that I respect Larry Summers a lot. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=545.36s)]
*  He's been right about a lot of things and Obama and Biden have been wrong. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=549.12s)]
*  Certain things that he said turned out to be true, certain things. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=554.3199999999999s)]
*  And he really, I do have a good respect for him. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=557.9200000000001s)]
*  He's a different kind of a guy and he speaks his mind. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=561.2s)]
*  I happen to be a big believer in tariffs because I think tariffs give you two things. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=564.24s)]
*  They give you economic gain, but they also give you a political gain. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=568.4000000000001s)]
*  If a country is out of control and something having nothing to do with economics or having [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=571.9200000000001s)]
*  nothing to do with money coming in or money going out, but other things that are very political, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=576.1600000000001s)]
*  because there are a lot of other things involved in countries, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=581.76s)]
*  you have tremendous power over a country. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=584.72s)]
*  Now, not everybody can say that, but we can because we're the big piggy bank. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=587.0400000000001s)]
*  But our piggy bank is going to get smaller and smaller all the time because we're losing power. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=590.96s)]
*  We're losing a lot of countries on the dollar. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=594.88s)]
*  I mean, they're going like flies. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  If we ever lose that, that's the equivalent of losing a war. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=600.08s)]
*  That would be unbelievable. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=603.5200000000001s)]
*  That would really make us a third world. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=604.5600000000001s)]
*  We have lost so many countries. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=607.0400000000001s)]
*  I looked the other day. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=608.5600000000001s)]
*  Russia's gone. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=610.3199999999999s)]
*  You take a look. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=613.3599999999999s)]
*  Ukraine doesn't exist in a sense. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=614.4799999999999s)]
*  Nobody knows what's going on there. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=616.64s)]
*  When you look at China is essentially gone. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=618.4799999999999s)]
*  They're trying to get out of it. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=620.7199999999999s)]
*  They're a primary competitor. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=622.4799999999999s)]
*  Iran is not there. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=625.5999999999999s)]
*  The other day, I read Saudi Arabia is willing to now go in various different currencies [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=627.1999999999999s)]
*  on the dollar. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=632.0799999999999s)]
*  This is a tragedy. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=634.0s)]
*  This is a big thing that's happening against our country. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=635.1999999999999s)]
*  We cannot let that happen. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=639.6s)]
*  With tariffs, it gives you a tremendous power as an example not to let that happen. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=641.52s)]
*  You say you want to do that. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=646.48s)]
*  We're going to put tariffs on your product coming into the United States. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=647.68s)]
*  But more importantly, and that's a big importance, but probably of more importance is they tax us. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=652.16s)]
*  We tax them. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=658.96s)]
*  Reciprocal trade. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=659.76s)]
*  I think we should have a reciprocal trade act. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=660.8s)]
*  If China is going to charge us $100 tariff or 100% tariff on a car, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=663.28s)]
*  then we should say you got to pay 100% to us. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=668.8s)]
*  I put on a large tariff on China cars coming in, and it had a huge impact, a huge positive impact. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=672.08s)]
*  And Biden only is doing the electric cars. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=679.04s)]
*  I don't know why that is because the electric cars, they're going to end up all being made [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=680.96s)]
*  in China, by the way. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=684.24s)]
*  They're not going to be made here. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=685.12s)]
*  The United Auto Workers are going to take a blow like no unions are. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=686.4s)]
*  Between that and people coming in, pouring into our country, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=689.52s)]
*  unions are getting absolutely decimated. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=692.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=695.6s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=696.24s)]
*  But the reciprocal act is, I think, a very important thing when these countries, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=697.12s)]
*  and I don't mean just China. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=702.8s)]
*  We have other countries. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=704.64s)]
*  You could take the European Union. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=706.0s)]
*  They don't want our farm product, and they don't want our cars, and they don't want anything. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=707.92s)]
*  We have a massive deficit right there. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=711.28s)]
*  But you could go with many countries, and they essentially do things to us, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=713.52s)]
*  and we should do things to them. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=718.48s)]
*  Basically, it should be reciprocal. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=720.5600000000001s)]
*  One of the things we've talked about, President Trump, on this podcast a lot is the deficit [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=722.64s)]
*  under your administration. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=726.48s)]
*  We added close to $8 trillion. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=727.44s)]
*  Under Biden, it's going to be, paradoxically, about the same number. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=729.36s)]
*  Seems incredibly unpopular in Washington to cut costs, but that's something we're going to need [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=732.72s)]
*  to do. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=738.48s)]
*  What's your plan? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=739.44s)]
*  And it looks like you're going to win a second term here. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=740.5600000000001s)]
*  What's your plan in your second term to control spending? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=742.64s)]
*  Can you get it under control? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=745.6800000000001s)]
*  Is there the will in Washington to allow you to do that? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=746.96s)]
*  Well, the biggest thing, I think, is growth, because we can grow our way out. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=750.16s)]
*  As an example, we have more liquid gold under our feet. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=753.76s)]
*  I use the term. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=756.88s)]
*  We have more oil. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=758.08s)]
*  We have more wells. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=759.04s)]
*  We have more everything than anybody else. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=760.4s)]
*  When I started, we were number three. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=762.56s)]
*  Now we're number one. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=764.24s)]
*  We were number one. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=765.36s)]
*  He's going to keep it that way until after the election. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=766.16s)]
*  If they ever won the election, there's no more oil coming out. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=768.88s)]
*  There's no more oil. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=772.0s)]
*  They were going down. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=773.28s)]
*  Oil is what caused the inflation. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=774.08s)]
*  You'd have nothing coming out. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=776.0s)]
*  It would be a disaster. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=777.4399999999999s)]
*  So they were intelligent enough to let the oil wells continue to go. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=779.04s)]
*  They're not happy about it. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=783.6s)]
*  But if this election were won by them, I can tell you right now, you would be—we would [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=785.2s)]
*  see oil go through the roof because they would really close it up. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=790.8000000000001s)]
*  Already, they're taken out of the strategic reserves just for politics because they want [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=794.32s)]
*  to try and keep the prices down as low as possible. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=798.24s)]
*  But the big thing, we have tremendous growth potential, and we have tremendous numbers [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=800.48s)]
*  of dollars that can be saved through efficiency. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=807.52s)]
*  The way we're spending money, hundreds of billions of dollars, what Biden did with the [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=810.3199999999999s)]
*  trillions of dollars that he borrowed for COVID. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=817.5999999999999s)]
*  Now, I had a different situation. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=820.4s)]
*  We were getting ready to start paying off debt. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=822.4s)]
*  We were getting ready to make a lot. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=824.9599999999999s)]
*  We had the greatest economy in history. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=826.4799999999999s)]
*  I had to throw a lot of money at COVID in order that we didn't end up in a 1929-type [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=828.8s)]
*  depression, which we could still end up in now because of what they've done. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=833.3599999999999s)]
*  But I threw a lot of money in, and we ended up not in a depression. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=837.68s)]
*  And then we ended up with a very—I ended up with a higher stock market than it was [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=841.8399999999999s)]
*  just previous to COVID coming in, which was pretty much of a miracle, according to most. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=846.4s)]
*  But we had to throw money out there in order to keep our country going. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=851.5999999999999s)]
*  We would have ended up—if I didn't do that, we would have ended up in a depression. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=855.92s)]
*  The problem is, when Biden came in, he took trillions and trillions of dollars for COVID. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=859.52s)]
*  He didn't use it for COVID. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=864.4s)]
*  He used it for other things. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=865.52s)]
*  But he took trillions of dollars out, and that caused a lot of the inflation. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=867.04s)]
*  Energy costs, his energy policies caused inflation, and his spending, the unbelievable [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=871.12s)]
*  spending that they did, caused inflation, tremendous inflation. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=877.5999999999999s)]
*  And it's going to have an impact for a long time to come. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=882.0s)]
*  — Can you talk about your impoundment authority intention? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=884.16s)]
*  You mentioned that in the past, that you could go in and reduce the bureaucracy and the spend. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=888.24s)]
*  I always tell people my position going into the election is less that I'm interested in [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=893.28s)]
*  knowing what the government's going to do for me, and I'm more interested in knowing [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=898.7199999999999s)]
*  what the government's going to stop doing that doesn't do any good for anyone. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=902.16s)]
*  And there seems to be a lot of that. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=905.1999999999999s)]
*  And I'm really curious to hear, sir, how you think about using the impoundment authority [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=907.04s)]
*  vested in you as president of the United States to reduce some of the bureaucracy, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=911.76s)]
*  wasteful spending, and create accountability. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=916.0s)]
*  And is there a team that you've built around you to help build a specific plan on [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=918.64s)]
*  backing out of some of these issues? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=923.52s)]
*  — Right. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=924.96s)]
*  We have a lot of money floating around that should be brought back into the government, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=925.52s)]
*  should be given back to D.C., to Washington. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=929.92s)]
*  As you know, there was a lot of money given out over the last couple of years, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=932.8s)]
*  especially over the last — my money was given out to help us with COVID. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=936.32s)]
*  Then they took money, and they have no idea what they're even doing with it. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=939.36s)]
*  That money can be given back, and it should be given back. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=942.56s)]
*  And things can be done with that money that are positive. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=945.04s)]
*  But we have — there are many, many things. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=948.16s)]
*  I'll give you an example. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=950.3199999999999s)]
*  Education. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=952.56s)]
*  We spend more on education per pupil than any other country. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=953.76s)]
*  We spend numbers that are — and yet we're terrible at it. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=958.4s)]
*  We're down at the bottom of the list, and yet we're at the top of the list. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=961.36s)]
*  I would give — I am going to, very early in the administration. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=964.9599999999999s)]
*  We're going to send education back to the states. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=968.0799999999999s)]
*  We're going to give them approximately half the number of dollars, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=970.64s)]
*  and they're going to have so much money that, like, they've never had before, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=973.52s)]
*  because they can spend a fraction of what we're spending right now [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=976.64s)]
*  and have much better school systems. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=980.4s)]
*  As an example, you go to — you could name many. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=982.64s)]
*  You go to Nebraska. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=985.92s)]
*  You go to Iowa. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=987.04s)]
*  You go to many states. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=988.4s)]
*  We'll do a far better job than we're doing right now, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=990.0799999999999s)]
*  and they'll do it for a fraction of the cost. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=993.12s)]
*  We'll save a tremendous amount of money and have better. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=994.96s)]
*  Some states, I don't believe, will do a very good job, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=997.68s)]
*  but they're going to have to learn to. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1000.24s)]
*  But we have — I would say most of our states will do a much better job. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1001.84s)]
*  I think all of them will do better than — you can't do worse than what we're doing right now, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1006.5600000000001s)]
*  but all of them will do better. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1010.8000000000001s)]
*  But some will be absolutely education, a factory in a positive sense, factories. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1012.1600000000001s)]
*  We are going to close up education. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1019.52s)]
*  We'll have a tiny little group to make sure everyone's teaching at least English [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1021.52s)]
*  and perhaps proper math, et cetera, et cetera, but very little. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1026.88s)]
*  Department of Education goes, and education goes back to the states and where it belongs. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1030.88s)]
*  I mean, where it absolutely belongs. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1038.16s)]
*  And you're going to save a lot of money. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1040.64s)]
*  You can look at interior with that. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1042.8000000000002s)]
*  You can look at environmental with a lot of that, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1044.64s)]
*  where the environment can be controlled by the states [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1047.68s)]
*  instead of this big bureaucracy in Washington, D.C. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1050.96s)]
*  I mean, what do you do when China is burning all the coal [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1054.3200000000002s)]
*  and they're sending the ashes over the United States? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1056.88s)]
*  Because that's what happens. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1060.16s)]
*  Takes three and a half days and it blows over the United States. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1061.3600000000001s)]
*  In the meantime, we're keeping things good. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1063.92s)]
*  We produce clean coal. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1066.0800000000002s)]
*  We're going to produce clean energy. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1067.2800000000002s)]
*  But we have to get back to energy. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1068.96s)]
*  We're spending trillions of dollars on artificial weak energy [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1071.2800000000002s)]
*  that's not going to fire up our plants. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1078.24s)]
*  Our plants have to be fired up. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1080.0800000000002s)]
*  We have a phenomena coming up right now. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1082.16s)]
*  And I was talking about it the other day to David. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1084.24s)]
*  And that's AI, little things, simple, two little simple letters. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1086.64s)]
*  But it's big. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1091.1200000000001s)]
*  And I realized the other day, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1092.48s)]
*  more than anything when we were at David's house [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1094.5600000000002s)]
*  and talking to a lot of geniuses from Silicon Valley and other places, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1097.3600000000001s)]
*  they need electricity at levels that nobody's ever experienced before [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1102.0s)]
*  to be successful, to be a leader in AI. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1106.8000000000002s)]
*  The amount of electricity that is like double what we have right now [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1110.0800000000002s)]
*  and even triple what we have right now, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1113.76s)]
*  they are, it's incredible how much they need to be the leader. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1116.0s)]
*  And we're going to have to be able to do that. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1122.24s)]
*  And a windmill turning with its blade knocking out the birds [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1123.92s)]
*  and everything else is not going to be able to make us competitive. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1127.92s)]
*  You'll have China. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1131.44s)]
*  What about nuclear, Mr. President? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1132.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1134.32s)]
*  So let me just give you a statistic on this. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1134.8s)]
*  China's building 150 nuclear reactors. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1136.64s)]
*  And they're only spending about $2,500 a kilowatt. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1139.68s)]
*  In the US, we're not building any. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1142.88s)]
*  And our cost to build them is about $10,000 a kilowatt. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1144.8s)]
*  And China is about to build as much capacity as 20% of the total US production in nuclear. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1148.1599999999999s)]
*  We clearly have a problem here in nuclear. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1154.0s)]
*  We do. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1156.32s)]
*  And nuclear is okay with me. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1156.8s)]
*  And what we're doing is, you know, if you look at Alabama, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1158.56s)]
*  you look at a couple of states where they built these plants [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1161.36s)]
*  and they had cost overruns that nobody's ever seen anything like it, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1163.68s)]
*  where they're costing $25 billion to build a plant. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1167.6s)]
*  There were a couple of them built in the South. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1170.8s)]
*  I won't mention the places, but you know the places. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1172.56s)]
*  And they came out at numbers that I think the most expensive things ever built in our country. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1174.8799999999999s)]
*  And the inspectors would go in, they'd say, those walls aren't thick enough. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1179.52s)]
*  Knock them down and build another wall. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1182.3999999999999s)]
*  And, you know, the environmental people were brutal. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1184.0s)]
*  You know, in France and in other places where they do have a lot of nuclear, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1187.6s)]
*  they build small plants all the same. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1191.04s)]
*  And if they need double the amount, they'll build two of them, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1193.36s)]
*  as opposed to the nonsense that we've done where we build these massive plants [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1196.1599999999999s)]
*  and they never get built and they have cost overruns of 3, 4, 500 percent. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1201.44s)]
*  Nobody's ever seen anything like it. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1207.04s)]
*  No, I'm okay with nuclear, but you have to do it in a way that makes sense. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1208.8799999999999s)]
*  And they have nuclear applications today that can be built [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1212.8799999999999s)]
*  and can be built reasonably inexpensively. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1217.04s)]
*  But nuclear certainly is very strong power. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1219.84s)]
*  Can I shift the conversation to foreign policy just for a minute, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1222.32s)]
*  just to make sure we get time to talk about foreign policy? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1224.32s)]
*  Is that okay with you guys? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1227.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1228.1599999999999s)]
*  Mr. President, I've really appreciated your comments saying that you want to bring [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1228.96s)]
*  a peace deal to the war in Ukraine so that people stop dying. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1232.48s)]
*  And I wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1235.5200000000002s)]
*  But I've seen that Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1238.48s)]
*  is talking about actually putting NATO troops or French troops in Ukraine [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1241.44s)]
*  as potentially a next step. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1246.48s)]
*  And that could be a tripwire for more NATO troops coming in. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1247.92s)]
*  Can you guarantee that no matter what, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1251.2s)]
*  you're not going to put American boots on the ground in Ukraine? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1253.44s)]
*  Is that something you can say definitively? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1256.48s)]
*  I would guarantee it. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1258.16s)]
*  I wouldn't know. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1259.1200000000001s)]
*  It's different for France. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1260.48s)]
*  They're neighbors, more or less. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1262.3200000000002s)]
*  We have an ocean in between. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1263.44s)]
*  It's different for Germany, although Germany is much less involved [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1265.28s)]
*  than they should be, and other countries. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1268.5600000000002s)]
*  But we have a big ocean in between. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1271.1200000000001s)]
*  One of the things I think is so unfair, David, I think it's terrible, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1273.8400000000001s)]
*  is that we're giving probably we're at least $100 billion more than Europe, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1277.68s)]
*  meaning Europe as a whole, put together. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1283.28s)]
*  And the economies are similar size, believe it or not. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1286.1599999999999s)]
*  That put together and us is about a very similar economy size. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1288.8s)]
*  But it's much more important for them. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1293.6s)]
*  It's important for everyone. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1295.1999999999998s)]
*  You have to have look, this would have never happened if I were president. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1296.9599999999998s)]
*  It would have never Putin would have never done it. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1301.36s)]
*  And it happened for two reasons. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1303.9199999999998s)]
*  It also happened because oil went through the roof [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1305.52s)]
*  and he had he had all this money to prosecute the war. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1307.36s)]
*  But the oil was at a much lower level, the price of oil. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1310.9599999999998s)]
*  He wouldn't have been able to afford the war. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1314.96s)]
*  All of a sudden, when it hit almost $100 a barrel, he said, you know, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1316.96s)]
*  I mean, he's one of the few to make money during a war because the oil has gone [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1321.1200000000001s)]
*  and it stayed very high. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1325.28s)]
*  It's extremely high right now. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1326.32s)]
*  And it's going up. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1327.76s)]
*  Oil prices all over the country are going up, as you probably have noticed. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1328.72s)]
*  But I will tell you that would have never happened. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1332.8s)]
*  Ukraine would have never happened. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1335.44s)]
*  The Israeli attack would have never happened. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1337.92s)]
*  And inflation would have never happened. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1340.16s)]
*  Those are three big things. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1341.8400000000001s)]
*  Inflation would have never happened. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1343.1200000000001s)]
*  But with Ukraine, and now it's very much. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1345.04s)]
*  Look, Ukraine is now I read the other day where they don't have the soldiers, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1348.96s)]
*  they don't have the manpower. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1353.2s)]
*  They want to use children. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1354.72s)]
*  They want to use old people, very old people, people that are not really perhaps equipped to fight. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1356.48s)]
*  They're not doing well. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1364.08s)]
*  The average age of their soldier is like 43 now. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1364.64s)]
*  So they're running out of they're literally running out of people to make a peace deal there. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1367.2s)]
*  Would you be willing to take NATO expansion off the table if that's what it took to [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1370.72s)]
*  get the Russians and the Ukrainians to make a deal? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1374.64s)]
*  Would you be willing to do that? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1377.2800000000002s)]
*  So for 20 years, I heard that NATO, if Ukraine goes into NATO, it's a real problem for Russia. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1378.24s)]
*  I've heard that for a long time. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1383.8400000000001s)]
*  And I think that's really why this war started. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1385.68s)]
*  I'm not sure that this war would have started. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1388.8000000000002s)]
*  Biden was saying all of the wrong things. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1391.3600000000001s)]
*  And one of the wrong things he was saying, no, Ukraine will go into NATO. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1393.68s)]
*  That's one of the many things he said. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1397.5200000000002s)]
*  When I listened to him speak, I said, this guy is going to start a war. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1399.8400000000001s)]
*  Because as you know, for four years, there was never even talk of Russia going into Ukraine. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1404.64s)]
*  That would have never happened. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1409.68s)]
*  Russia was not going to attack Ukraine. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1410.72s)]
*  As soon as I got out, they started to form along the lines. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1413.0400000000002s)]
*  And I thought that Putin may be will. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1416.4s)]
*  He's a good negotiator. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1418.0800000000002s)]
*  I thought he was going to be doing that for negotiation purposes. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1419.1200000000001s)]
*  Then all of a sudden they attacked. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1422.16s)]
*  And I said, what's going on here? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1423.68s)]
*  But if you look at the rhetoric from Biden, he was saying the opposite of what, in my opinion, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1425.6000000000001s)]
*  you had to say. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1432.0800000000002s)]
*  The things he was saying, and he's still saying it. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1433.44s)]
*  He's saying things that are so crazy. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1435.84s)]
*  Inflammatory. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1438.72s)]
*  Yeah, I 100% agree. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1439.44s)]
*  And it turns out that the month before the Russians invaded, Blinken told Lavrov that [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1441.04s)]
*  the administration was not only going to bring Ukraine into NATO, but that they thought it was [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1447.28s)]
*  OK for the United States to put nuclear weapons in Ukraine. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1452.16s)]
*  So no wonder the Russians hit the roof. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1455.68s)]
*  I mean, you talk about provocation. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1457.44s)]
*  Well, let's say you were running Russia. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1459.84s)]
*  You wouldn't be too happy. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1461.84s)]
*  And that's always been off the table. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1463.12s)]
*  You know, it's a border. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1465.04s)]
*  And it's always been, you know, I don't think that they would have, if they thought that [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1467.12s)]
*  that was going to remain sort of a territory where you don't have NATO, but they don't [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1472.1599999999999s)]
*  have soldiers right on their border. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1476.72s)]
*  They don't want to have it. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1478.08s)]
*  It's always been understood. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1478.8799999999999s)]
*  And that's even before Putin. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1480.1599999999999s)]
*  It's always been understood that that was a no-no. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1482.6399999999999s)]
*  And now you can go against their wishes. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1485.6s)]
*  And it doesn't mean they're right when they say that. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1487.9199999999998s)]
*  But that was very provocative. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1490.56s)]
*  And now it's even more provocative. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1492.4s)]
*  And they're talking about I hear routinely they're now talking about Ukraine entering [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1494.08s)]
*  NATO. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1499.68s)]
*  And now I hear France wants to go in and fight. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1500.16s)]
*  Well, I wish them a lot of luck. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1502.4s)]
*  I think good luck. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1503.84s)]
*  So can I ask you about Israel-Palestine? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1504.88s)]
*  So after October 7th, what's the right path to just resolve this once and for all and [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1508.48s)]
*  just move forward? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1514.08s)]
*  Again, it's so sad to me because it would have never happened. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1515.04s)]
*  Iran was broke. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1519.44s)]
*  They had no money. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1520.8799999999999s)]
*  I sanctioned countries that wanted to buy oil from Iran. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1522.48s)]
*  And I would have made a fair deal with Iran. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1526.48s)]
*  I was going to get along with Iran. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1528.32s)]
*  I was going to get along with everybody. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1529.92s)]
*  We did the Abraham Accords. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1531.6s)]
*  I think eventually Iran would have been in the Abraham Accords. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1533.04s)]
*  We had four strong countries go in and nobody went in since I got out. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1536.72s)]
*  That whole thing should have been loaded up right now. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1542.0s)]
*  It should have been full. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1544.3999999999999s)]
*  They did nothing with the Abraham Accords and everybody said we're great. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1545.76s)]
*  They said we're going to get the ultimate prize because of that. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1549.6s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1552.08s)]
*  If anybody else did it, if a Democrat did it, they would have gotten every prize in [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1552.8s)]
*  the book. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1559.1999999999998s)]
*  Every prize in the book. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1560.32s)]
*  But I did it. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1561.76s)]
*  And it was a great thing that we did. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1562.96s)]
*  It was a phenomenal thing. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1564.48s)]
*  But when you look at what happened now and you see what's going on, it's very, very, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1566.0s)]
*  very sad. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1570.56s)]
*  That attack would have never happened in a million years. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1571.28s)]
*  Iran didn't have the money for Hamas. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1574.16s)]
*  They didn't have the money for Hezbollah. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1576.6399999999999s)]
*  They didn't have the money for any of the 28 other cells of terror or whatever you want [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1578.24s)]
*  to call them. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1582.96s)]
*  Iran was broke. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1584.08s)]
*  I say respectfully. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1585.84s)]
*  They had no money and they weren't given money. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1587.2s)]
*  And actually it was a big story when I was toward the end of my term. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1589.52s)]
*  There was a lot of big stories that there was no terror going on because Iran didn't [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1593.52s)]
*  have the money. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1598.48s)]
*  They had to survive. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1598.96s)]
*  We would have made a deal good for everybody. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1600.72s)]
*  Everybody would have been happy. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1603.76s)]
*  The main thing is Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1604.96s)]
*  That was my main thing. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1607.04s)]
*  The deal was a simple deal. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1608.16s)]
*  Iran can't have a nuclear, you know, it can't have a missile, can't have a nuclear missile. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1609.8400000000001s)]
*  It cannot have that nuclear capability. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1615.28s)]
*  Other than that, we talk about everything. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1618.0800000000002s)]
*  They would have been very happy. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1620.0800000000002s)]
*  It would have been fine. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1621.2s)]
*  And you would have had peace in the Middle East. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1622.88s)]
*  The problem is I had them at a point where you could have negotiated. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1624.5600000000002s)]
*  A child could have made a deal with them. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1628.0s)]
*  And Biden did nothing. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1630.24s)]
*  He did nothing. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1631.76s)]
*  A child. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1632.88s)]
*  He doesn't like to negotiate. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1633.44s)]
*  A young man that do nothing or a young woman that do nothing in kindergarten could have [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1634.8s)]
*  made a deal with Iran at that time because they wanted to make a deal. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1639.92s)]
*  And Biden never took advantage of it. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1644.0s)]
*  Now, they put back no sanctions, all of the different things that they gave them. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1646.08s)]
*  China buys billions and billions of dollars of oil every month, many billions of dollars a month. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1651.12s)]
*  Other people are buying. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1657.44s)]
*  So Iran now has $250 billion cash. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1658.8s)]
*  They made it all in three and a half years. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1662.56s)]
*  And now they're much tougher to deal with. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1665.28s)]
*  And I will tell you, I got along great with Kim Jong-un. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1666.96s)]
*  We solved that problem. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1670.48s)]
*  Nobody was in danger. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1671.52s)]
*  But this is a big problem. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1673.12s)]
*  This is a real problem. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1674.48s)]
*  And within 90 days or so, they're going to have and could have very well a nuclear weapon. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1675.68s)]
*  And Israel is a big, is a big difference in Israel between Iran with a nuclear weapon [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1680.48s)]
*  and Iran without a nuclear weapon. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1686.48s)]
*  And lots of luck in that negotiation. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1688.32s)]
*  That's going to be a much more difficult negotiation. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1690.64s)]
*  President Trump, I wanted to ask you a question about Roe v. Wade. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1693.28s)]
*  You promised your base that you would overturn Roe v. Wade. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1697.92s)]
*  You added three people to the Supreme Court and you delivered on that promise. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1701.84s)]
*  This might be the issue that determines the election. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1705.52s)]
*  And many people believe it is. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1708.24s)]
*  Are you going to do a national abortion ban? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1710.24s)]
*  Would you support that? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1713.92s)]
*  Yes or no. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1714.72s)]
*  So I don't need a national ban because it's up to the states. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1715.6s)]
*  Right now, what I did is something that people have wanted to do for from day one. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1719.12s)]
*  Fifty one years it's been going on. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1723.6799999999998s)]
*  And if you remember, over the years, you're too young. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1726.1599999999999s)]
*  But over the years, all they wanted to do is they wanted to take it out of the federal [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1729.28s)]
*  government and move it into the states. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1733.6799999999998s)]
*  And I got that done with the selection of three great justices. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1735.9199999999998s)]
*  I got it done. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1739.12s)]
*  And it was a big thing. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1740.3999999999999s)]
*  But I will say over the last 10 years, or maybe a little bit more than that, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1742.24s)]
*  they started talking about the number of weeks and this and that. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1746.0s)]
*  A lot of different subjects came in. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1748.88s)]
*  It was no longer just simply bringing it back. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1750.4s)]
*  Every legal scholar from Democrat to Republican, liberal, conservative, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1753.28s)]
*  they all wanted it brought given to the states because from a legal standpoint, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1758.16s)]
*  from a lot of other standpoints, including even a moral standpoint, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1763.2s)]
*  they wanted it brought back to the states. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1766.96s)]
*  And what I did is I got it back to the states. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1769.68s)]
*  And now the states are in charge and the people are voting. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1772.96s)]
*  And some votes are coming out the way certain people want it. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1777.6000000000001s)]
*  And some votes aren't coming out the way certain people want it. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1781.2s)]
*  I mean, if you look at Ohio, I would say it was a more liberal vote than people would have thought. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1783.92s)]
*  And you could say that for Kansas. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1788.8s)]
*  And then you look at Texas. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1790.48s)]
*  It was a different story. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1791.76s)]
*  But the people of the states have got that issue now and they're voting. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1793.52s)]
*  And the one thing that we have to remember that there's been a lot of radicalism talked about. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1798.96s)]
*  And the radicalism is really on the left because they're willing to do abortions in the eighth [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1803.8400000000001s)]
*  and ninth month. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1808.64s)]
*  And even beyond that, I mean, we have some people, the governor, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1810.3200000000002s)]
*  take a look at the governor of Virginia, the former governor of Virginia, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1814.0s)]
*  where he talked about we will kill the baby after the baby is born. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1817.52s)]
*  That's a very radical stance. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1822.88s)]
*  And hopefully that's all going to be taken off the table now. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1825.0400000000002s)]
*  But just to put it simply, it's now up to the states. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1828.24s)]
*  And like Ronald Reagan, I'm a believer in the exceptions, the three exceptions, as you know, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1831.36s)]
*  and rape incest, life of the mother, the danger for the life of the mother. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1836.08s)]
*  And we have a situation now where it's in the state's hands and the states are going to be [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1841.6s)]
*  voting. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1848.32s)]
*  The last thing people want, the people are going to be voting. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1848.64s)]
*  The last thing people want is for that to go back into the federal government. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1851.92s)]
*  It was always fought and very importantly, and people wanted it. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1855.84s)]
*  They wanted it back in the states where it belongs legally and for a lot of other reasons. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1860.08s)]
*  So you wouldn't support a national ban? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1864.6399999999999s)]
*  No, I wouldn't support a national ban. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1866.56s)]
*  No, I would not. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1868.1599999999999s)]
*  Just shifting back to foreign policy for a moment, Mr. President, on the relationship [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1869.44s)]
*  with China, it's funny how Democrats and Republicans seem to have a unified voice and [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1874.1599999999999s)]
*  banging the drums on the rise of China. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1879.04s)]
*  Do you think that war with China is inevitable? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1883.2800000000002s)]
*  And if not, how do we avoid it? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1887.2800000000002s)]
*  I think it's not inevitable. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1889.2s)]
*  I think it's unlikely. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1890.5600000000002s)]
*  I know President Xi very well, and we got a long grade until COVID. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1892.64s)]
*  Then I wasn't so happy with him because they gave it to us. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1896.3200000000002s)]
*  I said it came from the Wuhan lab. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1898.8000000000002s)]
*  I was right about that. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1900.48s)]
*  They said then it started in Italy and then it started in France and started everywhere [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1902.4s)]
*  but there. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1906.8000000000002s)]
*  It started in China and it was a many, many millions of people died all over the world [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1908.16s)]
*  and cost the world probably $60 trillion, which is more money than China has and more [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1913.76s)]
*  money than anybody has. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1919.3600000000001s)]
*  The death and destruction has been unbelievable. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1921.04s)]
*  But I think it's high. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1924.24s)]
*  If you have the right president, we can live at peace with China. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1926.24s)]
*  We can do very well with China, compete with China, but we don't have the right president [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1930.32s)]
*  right now. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1934.88s)]
*  He's not respected by China. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1935.2s)]
*  He's being left at by China and he's a Manchurian candidate. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1936.88s)]
*  I mean, he's received money from China, his family, and that makes him to me somebody [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1940.64s)]
*  that shouldn't be negotiating. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1945.3600000000001s)]
*  He's got a conflict of interest. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1946.96s)]
*  But no, I don't see war with China as being inevitable at all. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1949.3600000000001s)]
*  President Trump, do you think that Fauci and our government funded gain of function research [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1953.3600000000001s)]
*  and do you think we should really be pursuing the investigation deeply into that? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1958.8000000000002s)]
*  And if we did fund gain of function research, what does that say about our government and [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1964.16s)]
*  taking ownership of it? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1970.16s)]
*  Because a lot of us lost a lot of years. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1971.2s)]
*  Kids didn't go to school and it caused economic damage. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1973.6000000000001s)]
*  As you pointed out earlier, the amount of money you had to spend to try to avoid a [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1978.0s)]
*  depression was really severe. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1981.0400000000002s)]
*  And if we funded that, what does that make you think about our government? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1983.44s)]
*  And then Fauci covering it up, if that is in fact true, what does that make you think [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1987.3600000000001s)]
*  about our government? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1991.76s)]
*  So if you remember, I'm the one that stopped it and I stopped it maybe for a lucky reason [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1992.72s)]
*  or an unusual reason. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=1998.32s)]
*  I said, why are we paying money to China? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2000.0s)]
*  It wasn't about gain of function or anything else. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2002.48s)]
*  It was why are we paying money to China? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2005.04s)]
*  China's got a lot of money and they're doing fine. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2006.56s)]
*  We're considered like they want us to consider them a growing nation, a nation in distress, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2010.56s)]
*  all sorts of things because they always take advantage of every treaty by saying [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2017.84s)]
*  that they need, you know, they're an improving nation. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2021.52s)]
*  I heard the other day they have all different terms for changing, but they're a growing [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2025.92s)]
*  nation. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2030.56s)]
*  Well, we're a growing nation, too. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2030.8799999999999s)]
*  We're a nation that's becoming a third world nation based on what we're seeing. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2032.72s)]
*  But I was the one that stopped that when I saw that. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2036.6399999999999s)]
*  I was the one that stopped that. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2038.96s)]
*  The Fauci thing is an interesting phenomena. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2041.04s)]
*  He's a much I was not a big fan of his. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2044.72s)]
*  As you know, he said, no, let everybody come in from China. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2047.2s)]
*  I overrode him on that. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2050.08s)]
*  I overrode him on a lot, but he wanted the people from China. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2052.0s)]
*  When I heard about this, I stopped it. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2055.92s)]
*  We had a room loaded up with people and nobody could even believe it. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2058.48s)]
*  But I stopped it. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2061.68s)]
*  We would have lost hundreds of thousands of people more, maybe more, much more, maybe [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2062.4s)]
*  over the millions, but hundreds of thousands of people more. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2067.44s)]
*  Had I not stopped people coming in from China, did he lie to you about the origin of COVID? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2070.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, I've always said the origin was where it came from, where it originally came from [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2076.72s)]
*  was the Wuhan lab. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2081.4399999999996s)]
*  I happen to think it escaped from the Wuhan lab. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2082.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, I don't believe it came from the bats in 2000 miles away caves. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2085.4399999999996s)]
*  I don't believe it came from other countries as China tried to convince people it did. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2090.72s)]
*  I thought it should have been called the China virus because it was a very much more [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2095.7599999999998s)]
*  accurate term than COVID. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2099.3599999999997s)]
*  Nobody knows what COVID even means. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2101.04s)]
*  Why is it COVID? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2102.64s)]
*  But no, I was always. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2104.32s)]
*  But did Fauci lie to you, I guess, is what the American people want to know. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2106.88s)]
*  Did Fauci lie to you? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2110.32s)]
*  And if he did, should he be prosecuted? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2111.2s)]
*  I don't think I dealt. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2113.2s)]
*  You have to understand Fauci was a much bigger factor in the Biden administration than he [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2115.04s)]
*  was in the Trump administration. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2118.72s)]
*  I didn't rely on him that much because I didn't trust him. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2120.24s)]
*  I would say got along with him fine. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2124.0s)]
*  Not really. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2127.44s)]
*  But I didn't trust him. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2128.4s)]
*  And again, I was the one that stopped the money going to China. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2130.0s)]
*  I didn't like it. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2133.36s)]
*  I didn't stop it because of COVID. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2134.4s)]
*  I didn't stop it because of anything other than why are we paying money to China? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2136.1600000000003s)]
*  It was strange. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2141.52s)]
*  They should pay us money. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2142.6400000000003s)]
*  We shouldn't pay them money. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2143.76s)]
*  One of the things I can tell you, the World Health Organization, so we pay them almost [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2145.44s)]
*  $500 million and China pays them $39 million. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2151.2000000000003s)]
*  And so I got out of the World Health Organization. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2156.0s)]
*  They did absolutely nothing. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2158.7200000000003s)]
*  They called it totally wrong. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2160.08s)]
*  I got out. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2161.52s)]
*  They called me and they said, we'll do anything to keep you in, anything, anything. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2162.64s)]
*  I said, well, why are they paying $39 million? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2166.64s)]
*  We're paying almost $500 million. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2169.2799999999997s)]
*  And they said, well, we'll work out a deal where you can pay much less. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2171.44s)]
*  I said, well, now you're starting to talk. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2175.52s)]
*  But even that, it was very popular when I got out. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2177.3599999999997s)]
*  It was very politically, it would have been very hard to go back in. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2180.08s)]
*  People were thrilled that I got out. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2183.12s)]
*  I could have made a deal to go in for $39 million. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2185.6s)]
*  They offered me a deal to go in for $39 million and I actually turned it down. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2188.4s)]
*  I said, you know, it should be a third. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2192.16s)]
*  It should be, if you look at where $350 million, they're at 1.4 billion people. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2193.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2198.56s)]
*  So it should have been 25% or less than that. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2198.7999999999997s)]
*  But I didn't want to quibble. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2201.68s)]
*  But I could have gone back in immediately for $39 million as opposed to $500. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2203.3599999999997s)]
*  Then a horrible, horrible election, which helped destroy our country took place in 2020. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2209.12s)]
*  And they went back in and they're paying more than $500 million. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2216.48s)]
*  And they knew I could have made a deal. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2221.04s)]
*  Now, it's a lot of money, not when you talk about the world, but it's still a lot of money. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2222.8799999999997s)]
*  But it shows you the stupidity of the whole thing. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2228.4799999999996s)]
*  They could have made a deal for $39 million. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2231.7599999999998s)]
*  Instead, they're paying much more than they paid even before. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2234.24s)]
*  And that's the way the mindset of our country is. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2238.24s)]
*  And here's the big part. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2241.3599999999997s)]
*  China totally controls the WHO. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2243.04s)]
*  China totally controls them. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2246.7999999999997s)]
*  We have very little control over them. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2248.72s)]
*  And now they want to give control over our whole country to them, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2250.7999999999997s)]
*  which would be a terrible mistake. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2254.16s)]
*  Fauci brings up sort of the kind of deep state personality that you talked about in 2016. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2255.92s)]
*  That's kind of like riddled all over the government. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2261.3599999999997s)]
*  How much progress do you think you made and how what do you want to do if you become president [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2263.7599999999998s)]
*  in November? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2268.64s)]
*  And do you have goals around the deep state this time around? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2269.6s)]
*  And what are they? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2272.4s)]
*  Well, I have a lot of things. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2273.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, I did a lot of things in the FBI. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2274.64s)]
*  I fired a lot of their top people, including Comey, who was terrible at what he did, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2276.56s)]
*  a terrible person and terrible at what he did. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2280.88s)]
*  I fired McCabe. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2284.32s)]
*  And I don't have to go through Lisa and struck and all of the other lovers. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2285.52s)]
*  And I fired the whole group of people. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2290.32s)]
*  I got rid of them. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2293.12s)]
*  And so many of the agents are so incredible in the FBI down below. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2295.2799999999997s)]
*  But we got rid of a lot. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2299.52s)]
*  You take a look at the World Health again. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2302.08s)]
*  We got out of the World Health. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2303.92s)]
*  We got out of the this is a similar thing that this is really similar to your answer. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2305.3599999999997s)]
*  But we got out of the World Health Organization, which was a tremendous thing. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2310.96s)]
*  We got rid of the Paris Accord. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2314.16s)]
*  The Paris Accord was a disaster for us. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2316.56s)]
*  We were going to pay a trillion dollars and other countries were paying nothing. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2319.52s)]
*  Russia was paying nothing. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2324.3999999999996s)]
*  China was paying nothing. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2325.8399999999997s)]
*  It didn't even kick in for China until 2030, whereas with us, it kicked in immediately. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2327.2799999999997s)]
*  So I got rid of the Paris Accord. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2332.24s)]
*  I did a lot of things having to do with not only people, but tremendous amounts of money [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2334.64s)]
*  because the Paris Accord was so unfair. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2340.4s)]
*  And I said, you know, when I do this, people are not going to like it, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2344.0s)]
*  but I have to do it because it's right. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2347.6s)]
*  People loved it. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2349.12s)]
*  The public understood it. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2350.24s)]
*  They loved it. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2351.92s)]
*  And now they've gone back into the Paris Accord at the same terms and even worse [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2352.72s)]
*  than the terms I got out. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2357.6s)]
*  It's really a shame. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2359.3599999999997s)]
*  It's so many things. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2360.24s)]
*  It's so sad to see so many things. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2361.2s)]
*  I mean, the WHO, the Paris Accord, you take a look at these things, they could have gone back. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2363.1200000000003s)]
*  If they wanted to go back, if they had it, they could have gone back for a fraction of what they [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2369.84s)]
*  were doing. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2373.6000000000004s)]
*  And they're very unfair to the United States. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2374.5600000000004s)]
*  We're like a lapdog for every other country. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2376.7200000000003s)]
*  HG Mr. President, I know you're running out of time here. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2379.36s)]
*  So we haven't had a chance for you to speak to the border situation yet. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2382.48s)]
*  So I want to give you a chance to address that because that's always been really one of [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2385.84s)]
*  your main issues since always since 2016. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2391.12s)]
*  You wanted to build a wall. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2393.92s)]
*  The Democrats did everything they could to thwart that. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2395.12s)]
*  You built the wall, but then Biden left a bunch of holes in it and then sold off the parts for [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2397.28s)]
*  scrap metal. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2402.08s)]
*  And now we've had the problem and repealed your executive orders. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2403.12s)]
*  So I want to give you a chance to speak to that. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2405.36s)]
*  Just one piece I want to just add in as a follow up question is a lot of tech CEOs say [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2407.6s)]
*  if we fix the border, can we get more H1Bs for tech workers? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2414.32s)]
*  So can you address that as well as what's going on at the border? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2417.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2420.96s)]
*  So we built hundreds of miles of well, David, as you know, and we're very proud of it. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2421.52s)]
*  We did it as per specification by the Border Patrol. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2426.16s)]
*  They wanted exactly the wall that we did with the climb paddle on top with steel concrete [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2429.04s)]
*  and then rebar and all of the things that they wanted. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2433.68s)]
*  They wanted to have vision through it clearly through it. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2436.48s)]
*  Because I thought about concrete plank, frankly, going up 40 or 50 feet and they [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2439.7599999999998s)]
*  they didn't like that. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2443.92s)]
*  They wanted to have vision through. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2444.72s)]
*  And I understood that too. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2446.32s)]
*  I sort of disagreed with it, but that's OK. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2448.32s)]
*  We actually brought climbers in, Mount Everest climbers to climb. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2450.7200000000003s)]
*  And we built a very hard wall to climb. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2454.0s)]
*  It's a very effective wall. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2457.1200000000003s)]
*  And we built hundreds of miles and then we were going to add quite a bit at the very end. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2459.44s)]
*  And we bought about 200 additional miles and it was ready to be put up, could have been put up in [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2466.2400000000002s)]
*  three weeks, maybe four weeks. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2473.28s)]
*  And areas that were rough areas that were people coming in, because as you build the wall, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2475.52s)]
*  they go in different areas, right? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2480.48s)]
*  They go further out. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2481.84s)]
*  It was so effective. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2484.8s)]
*  It was so effective. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2486.0s)]
*  Mexico gave us a lot of troops for free because of a certain negotiation that I had with them. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2487.44s)]
*  You heard that. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2492.1600000000003s)]
*  But it was so effective, the wall. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2493.04s)]
*  But Biden, they didn't want to put up those slats that were going up routinely by us. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2495.52s)]
*  That means you had gaps. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2502.6400000000003s)]
*  As an example, you had gates in certain area that we put up, we were going to put up big, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2504.32s)]
*  powerful gates that we could open and you could let equipment through, et cetera, et cetera, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2509.36s)]
*  if you needed it. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2514.32s)]
*  And they got rid of everything. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2515.6800000000003s)]
*  They sold it for five cents on the dollar, much of it, five cents on the dollar. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2518.0s)]
*  I said, I can't believe it. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2522.64s)]
*  And that's the first time that I said they're serious. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2523.92s)]
*  They actually want open borders. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2526.8s)]
*  They want an open border. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2528.16s)]
*  Nobody could believe it. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2529.6800000000003s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2530.64s)]
*  Because I never believed they wanted an open border because who would be stupid enough [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2531.92s)]
*  to want an open border? [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2535.36s)]
*  Look what's happened with an open border. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2536.32s)]
*  I was very proud of that. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2538.2400000000002s)]
*  We built, we had the safest border in the history of our country. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2539.36s)]
*  And now we have the worst border in the history of the world. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2542.48s)]
*  We had a safe border. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2545.28s)]
*  I had a remain in Mexico policy, catch and release in Mexico, not in the United States. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2546.56s)]
*  Everything was so good. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2552.48s)]
*  But the remain in Mexico was a big deal, not easy to get, but it was a big deal. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2553.6800000000003s)]
*  They were in Tijuana, hundreds of thousands of people. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2558.0s)]
*  They had to be approved to come into our country. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2561.04s)]
*  And now you look at what's happened. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2563.6s)]
*  We've been overrun. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2565.6s)]
*  It's an invasion of our country by people. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2567.12s)]
*  Many people come out of jails and prisons. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2569.2799999999997s)]
*  They come out of mental institutions, insane asylums. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2571.84s)]
*  And we have terrorists coming into our country at a level that we've never seen before. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2575.36s)]
*  It's a very sad. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2579.68s)]
*  I never understood why the wall was so controversial. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2580.48s)]
*  Every country needs to have a border. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2583.36s)]
*  And a wall is a really good way to enforce a border. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2584.96s)]
*  I never understood why they were so animated about stopping you from building the wall [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2587.04s)]
*  after you ran on that issue in 2016. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2593.2799999999997s)]
*  They held you up for years with litigation. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2595.6s)]
*  And then, like you said, they wouldn't just finish the little pieces of it. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2598.08s)]
*  And they left big holes in it. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2601.2s)]
*  And I think you're right. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2603.12s)]
*  The only conclusion is they want an open border. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2604.32s)]
*  I mean, how else do you explain it? [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2606.16s)]
*  They want to destroy our country. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2607.6s)]
*  You know, the fact is it's incredible. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2609.2s)]
*  The big mistake I made, I should have said, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2612.08s)]
*  I will not build a wall. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2615.04s)]
*  We do not want a wall. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2617.28s)]
*  And that wall would have gone up in 15 minutes. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2619.76s)]
*  The more important point, I think, Mr. President, is we need high skilled workers in this country. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2621.6800000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2628.48s)]
*  We need to recruit the best and brightest from the world. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2628.88s)]
*  Every time we get somebody super intelligent from India or Europe, any country, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2631.44s)]
*  that's one less. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2636.64s)]
*  Three of us are immigrants, sir. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2637.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2638.08s)]
*  And three of the four here are immigrants, the ones without the ties. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2638.32s)]
*  And we can get these great people into our country. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2641.92s)]
*  And that's a loss for our adversaries and our competitors. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2645.92s)]
*  And it's a game for us. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2648.7200000000003s)]
*  But I've never heard you talk about this. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2649.52s)]
*  Can you please promise us you will give us more ability to import the best and brightest [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2651.52s)]
*  around the world to America? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2658.08s)]
*  I do promise. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2659.1200000000003s)]
*  But I happen to agree. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2659.84s)]
*  That's why I promise. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2660.96s)]
*  Otherwise, I wouldn't promise. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2661.84s)]
*  Let me just tell you that it's so sad when we lose people from Harvard, MIT, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2663.2000000000003s)]
*  from the greatest schools and lesser schools that are phenomenal schools also. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2668.56s)]
*  And what I wanted to do, and I would have done this, but then we had to solve the COVID [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2673.44s)]
*  problem because that came in and sort of dominated for a little while, as you perhaps know. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2677.12s)]
*  But what I want to do and what I will do is you graduate from a college. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2682.16s)]
*  I think you should get automatically as part of your diploma a green card to be able to stay in [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2686.72s)]
*  this country. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2691.2799999999997s)]
*  And that includes junior colleges, too. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2692.0s)]
*  Anybody graduates from a college, you go in there for two years or four years. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2694.24s)]
*  If you graduate or you get a doctorate degree from a college, you should be able to stay in [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2698.32s)]
*  this country. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2702.32s)]
*  And you know more stories than I do, but I know of stories where people graduated from a top [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2702.88s)]
*  college or from a college and they desperately wanted to stay here. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2708.0800000000004s)]
*  They had a plan for a company, a concept, and they can't. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2711.92s)]
*  They go back to India. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2715.52s)]
*  They go back to China. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2716.7200000000003s)]
*  They do the same basic company in those places, and they become multi-billionaires employing [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2718.2400000000002s)]
*  thousands and thousands of people. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2723.2000000000003s)]
*  And it could have been done here. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2724.96s)]
*  And a bigger example is you need a pool of people to work for your companies. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2726.48s)]
*  You have great companies and they have to be smart people. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2731.52s)]
*  Not everybody can be less than smart. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2733.92s)]
*  You need brilliant people. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2736.88s)]
*  And we force the brilliant people, the people that graduate from college, the people that are [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2738.4s)]
*  number one in their class from the best colleges, you have to be able to recruit these people and [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2743.28s)]
*  keep the people. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2748.2400000000002s)]
*  It was such a big deal. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2749.44s)]
*  Somebody graduates at the top of the class. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2750.72s)]
*  They can't even make a deal with the company because they don't think they're going to be [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2753.12s)]
*  able to stay in the country. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2756.0s)]
*  That is going to end on day one. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2757.44s)]
*  That's fantastic. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2759.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2761.36s)]
*  Well, I think we all wholeheartedly agree with that. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2761.92s)]
*  Being in the tech industry, we understand the importance of that. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2764.88s)]
*  They're telling us that you have to go to De Nervis as president. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2768.0s)]
*  So thank you so much for spending so much time with us. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2769.92s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2771.84s)]
*  It's been great having this conversation with you. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2772.96s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2774.96s)]
*  I have to ask one question, sir. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2775.28s)]
*  When you got elected in the 2016 election, you said the first thing or one of the things [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2778.24s)]
*  you wanted to do was release the JFK file. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2783.28s)]
*  And then you said later, I saw it and I just I wasn't really ready to do it. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2786.5600000000004s)]
*  And then I saw a clip where you changed your mind and you said, I think we're ready to [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2790.5600000000004s)]
*  see this file. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2794.96s)]
*  And I'm just curious. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2796.8s)]
*  What's in it? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2798.1600000000003s)]
*  What? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2799.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2799.52s)]
*  Tell us right now. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2799.92s)]
*  What happened? [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2801.0400000000004s)]
*  I actually did do it. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2802.6400000000003s)]
*  I released a lot, as you know. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2804.6400000000003s)]
*  But when it came to the whole thing, I was hit by some people that worked for me that [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2806.5600000000004s)]
*  are great people that you would respect. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2810.7200000000003s)]
*  And they asked me not to do it. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2812.56s)]
*  And I'm saying, why? [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2814.32s)]
*  Tell me why. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2815.44s)]
*  And they said, sir, I think it needs a little more time. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2816.56s)]
*  And I released a lot. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2819.2s)]
*  But I said, if they feel so strongly, I respect the people and would have done that again. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2821.6s)]
*  But this time, I'm just going to do it. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2827.36s)]
*  RFK says the CIA killed his uncle. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2829.04s)]
*  Do you believe that? [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2832.88s)]
*  Well, this wasn't CIA that asked me, but I think CIA was probably behind it. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2833.52s)]
*  But they didn't. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2837.68s)]
*  They would have preferred that I not release the rest of it. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2838.96s)]
*  So we did give quite a bit. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2841.6s)]
*  It's going to be done early on. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2844.88s)]
*  A lot of people want to see that. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2846.32s)]
*  And whatever it may say, I won't say. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2848.0s)]
*  I sort of have an idea. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2851.12s)]
*  But whatever it is, it'll be very interesting for people to see. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2852.64s)]
*  And we're going to have to learn from it. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2856.96s)]
*  Promise us you'll come back again. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2858.48s)]
*  You know, there are other things we're going to release, too. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2859.7599999999998s)]
*  We're going to release some. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2862.24s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2862.96s)]
*  What? [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2863.36s)]
*  What else do you got? [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2863.7599999999998s)]
*  We'll talk to you about it off camera. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2865.04s)]
*  Aliens? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2866.56s)]
*  By the way, I generally speaking, and there are reasons not to release certain things, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2867.06s)]
*  obviously, but I generally know it's transparency. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2873.14s)]
*  And I think it's important that we release that. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2876.66s)]
*  And there are other things, too. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2878.9s)]
*  There are other things that you know about. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2880.18s)]
*  But people, more than anything else, they want the JFK files. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2882.34s)]
*  We're going to release that immediately. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2885.38s)]
*  You have a prediction for the debate next week. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2886.9s)]
*  What's going to happen? [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2888.5s)]
*  Well, all I can say is this. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2889.7s)]
*  I watched him with Paul Ryan and he destroyed Paul Ryan. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2891.2999999999997s)]
*  Paul Ryan with the water. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2894.74s)]
*  He was chugging water at a left and right. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2895.78s)]
*  I didn't think a human being would be able to drink so much water at one time. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2897.46s)]
*  And he beat Paul Ryan. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2901.3s)]
*  So I'm not underestimating him. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2902.9s)]
*  I'm not underestimating him. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2905.2200000000003s)]
*  It is what it is. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2906.98s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2908.98s)]
*  But you take a look at the last one. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2910.1000000000004s)]
*  I happen to think he's incompetent for a lot of reasons. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2912.6600000000003s)]
*  I think he's incompetent because he has gotten the worst policies, both foreign policy and [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2915.78s)]
*  internal policy. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2922.82s)]
*  Who would not want to have a wall? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2924.26s)]
*  Who wants to have millions of people pouring in? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2925.78s)]
*  Who wants to have high taxes? [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2927.94s)]
*  You know, taxes are going to raise by four times if this guy has this plan. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2929.38s)]
*  Is he in cognitive decline? [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2933.94s)]
*  Do you believe he's in cognitive decline, Mr. President? [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2935.2200000000003s)]
*  I shouldn't be the one to say that, but I don't think he's doing particularly well. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2937.38s)]
*  But I didn't think he was well 25 years ago. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2940.34s)]
*  I thought he was not a smart person. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2942.42s)]
*  And that was told to me by a certain member of the Kennedy family who was actually very [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2944.42s)]
*  friendly with me through a Palm Beach relationship. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2949.2200000000003s)]
*  And I was told that very strongly. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2952.66s)]
*  But so I was never a fan of his. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2955.06s)]
*  But I will say he beat Paul Ryan, who was still years ago, but he beat Paul Ryan pretty [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2957.22s)]
*  badly. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2963.54s)]
*  And I assume he's going to be somebody that will be a worthy debater. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2964.02s)]
*  Yeah, I would say I think I don't want to underestimate him. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2969.46s)]
*  All right. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2973.8599999999997s)]
*  I think that's smart. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2974.5s)]
*  Well, your team is telling us that they need you to go to a dinner, Mr. President. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2975.7s)]
*  Obviously, we could keep going for hours and hours. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2979.46s)]
*  But it's been great to have you for the last hour here. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2981.3s)]
*  And it's been great getting to know you with the dinner that we did. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2987.38s)]
*  And we hope that you'll come back on our show. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2990.6600000000003s)]
*  Podcasts are getting bigger and bigger. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2992.82s)]
*  So hopefully in your second term, you'll come on here and talk to us again. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2994.5800000000004s)]
*  I think Biden would do this interview. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=2999.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3001.78s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3002.26s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3003.38s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3004.1000000000004s)]
*  We invited him. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3005.6200000000003s)]
*  I don't think he's doing these interviews. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3006.98s)]
*  So it's an honor to be with you all. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3009.14s)]
*  Very good. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3011.2999999999997s)]
*  We appreciate it, sir. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3011.8599999999997s)]
*  Thank you very much, sir. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3012.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3014.5s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3015.06s)]
*  There you have it. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3015.7s)]
*  Wow. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3016.5s)]
*  That was some hour, boys. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3017.7s)]
*  What do we think? [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3018.98s)]
*  Let's do a wrap up, huh? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3020.02s)]
*  Do a little wrap here. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3022.42s)]
*  J. Cal, what are your big takeaways? [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3025.94s)]
*  Well, I'm undecided, as you know. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3028.98s)]
*  We had a limited amount of time with him. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3031.7s)]
*  And obviously- [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3033.2999999999997s)]
*  J. Cal, just say it. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3033.54s)]
*  Just say it. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3034.5s)]
*  You like him. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3034.9s)]
*  You didn't? [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3035.7s)]
*  You were- [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3036.2599999999998s)]
*  Just say it. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3036.98s)]
*  Just say it because it's written all across your face. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3037.62s)]
*  Just say it. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3039.7799999999997s)]
*  You like him. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3040.2599999999998s)]
*  You're confused. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3040.74s)]
*  I have some blockers. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3041.8599999999997s)]
*  He crushed your questions. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3042.42s)]
*  No, he crushed your questions. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3043.7s)]
*  Admit it. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3044.8199999999997s)]
*  I think he did. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3045.22s)]
*  You asked great questions, and he just dealt with them head on. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3046.5s)]
*  Just admit it. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3049.2999999999997s)]
*  You like him. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3050.02s)]
*  You like him. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3050.98s)]
*  Well, I do like the fact that he came on the pod. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3055.22s)]
*  I told you you'd like him. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3057.06s)]
*  I told you you'd like him. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3058.58s)]
*  This is my point. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3059.7s)]
*  Whether you come out of it wanting to vote for the president or not, everybody needs to, I think, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3060.98s)]
*  just sit in a room and just hear him out. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3067.06s)]
*  If you want me to answer the question, what I'll say is there are some blockers I have that we [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3069.62s)]
*  didn't get to. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3073.7799999999997s)]
*  January 6th, obviously. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3074.42s)]
*  One of the blockers I have is obviously Roe v. Wade, and I think he handled that question [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3076.34s)]
*  really well. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3080.18s)]
*  And I think we may have gotten a little bit of breaking news there in terms of him saying he [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3081.54s)]
*  would not do the national ban. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3086.9s)]
*  And I think that's a big concern people have, and I think that's maybe the issue, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3089.06s)]
*  according to a lot of experts. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3094.02s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm just sounding like Trump. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3095.22s)]
*  I have three. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3096.1s)]
*  For a lot of experts, people believe that could be the deciding issue of the election. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3096.42s)]
*  And so I think he handled it really well by saying the states are going to choose and he's [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3100.98s)]
*  not going to do the federal ban. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3105.06s)]
*  He was very- [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3106.02s)]
*  He believes it's an exemption. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3106.5s)]
*  He was very unequivocal about that, really clear that he would not do a national ban, [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3107.54s)]
*  really clear that the states would decide. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3111.38s)]
*  And furthermore, he understood that the states are deciding. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3113.3s)]
*  There's been a bunch of referenda at the state level, and they are generally coming out on the [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3116.26s)]
*  pro-choice side. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3120.9s)]
*  And he indicated that he understood that some of the votes are not turning out the way the [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3121.78s)]
*  people may have thought. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3125.06s)]
*  And he's going to respect that. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3126.5s)]
*  Right, 80% of people want women to choose. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3128.0200000000004s)]
*  He's going to respect democracy on that issue. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3131.2200000000003s)]
*  So I think he nailed that question. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3133.6200000000003s)]
*  I think he was very definitive about Ukraine not entering NATO. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3136.7400000000002s)]
*  And I think he was very definitive about an H1B policy that's pro-productivity and immigration. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3143.0600000000004s)]
*  That was the part I liked best, if I'm being honest. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3149.86s)]
*  And giving grads green cards, that's such a good idea. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3151.5400000000004s)]
*  That's breaking news too, by the way. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3154.6600000000003s)]
*  I think we elevated the discussion about immigration beyond the wall and into recruitment, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3155.78s)]
*  which is what I have been trying to do on this podcast for a couple of years here now. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3159.7000000000003s)]
*  So to hear the president say, I will do that for you because I want that. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3163.3s)]
*  That to me was palpable. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3166.9s)]
*  And there's a lot of things I agree with him on. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3169.1400000000003s)]
*  And the January 6th, we didn't get to. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3171.6200000000003s)]
*  So apologies to the audience on that. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3173.6200000000003s)]
*  I know a lot of people have feelings about it. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3175.1400000000003s)]
*  But you can only get so much from 50 minutes of interview. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3176.5800000000004s)]
*  I think you did a great job. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3179.46s)]
*  Well, CNN did a whole town hall on that issue. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3180.02s)]
*  I mean, quite frankly, I felt like we dealt with a lot of substance here. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3182.02s)]
*  But Chamath, I agree with you. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3185.54s)]
*  He was really clear on Ukraine. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3186.6600000000003s)]
*  He went further than he has in the past. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3187.94s)]
*  In the past, he said that he'll get a peace deal very quickly, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3189.54s)]
*  and that he wants the people to stop dying. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3192.42s)]
*  But in this interview, he went further. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3194.1800000000003s)]
*  He said that if France or other European countries send in troops, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3196.26s)]
*  the US definitely will not participate in that. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3199.94s)]
*  We are not going to send American boots on the ground. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3202.1s)]
*  The Biden administration, I don't think has said that definitively the way that [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3204.82s)]
*  President Trump said it. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3208.82s)]
*  Moreover, he understood that a major cause of the war was the desire to bring Ukraine into NATO. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3209.94s)]
*  And I've never heard anyone in the administration say that. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3218.1800000000003s)]
*  And he went further and said they keep saying these provocative things about, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3222.1800000000003s)]
*  even now they keep repeating that Ukraine is going to be part of NATO. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3226.02s)]
*  So he understood the provocation there. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3229.86s)]
*  Friarbrough, what's your take on him? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3232.42s)]
*  You haven't come out and said who you're voting for, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3234.5s)]
*  but this is your first time interacting with him, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3236.42s)]
*  albeit for 50 minutes in a group setting. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3238.82s)]
*  But what's your question? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3240.82s)]
*  It's a difficult forum because we can't go deep and ask responsive questions, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3242.1800000000003s)]
*  and we don't have a lot of time, and there's four of us trying to ask questions. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3246.5800000000004s)]
*  So the format is a little difficult to get to the heart of the matter on some of these [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3248.98s)]
*  complicated topics like federal spending. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3252.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, we need two hours. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3254.98s)]
*  That, yeah. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3256.1800000000003s)]
*  And I think you need to just be able to like hone in on the question, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3257.3s)]
*  his response on how are we going to reduce kind of the bureaucratic overhead [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3260.98s)]
*  and the wasteful spending and the federal government. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3264.98s)]
*  And he kind of pivoted to the Department of Education. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3266.98s)]
*  That's 3% of the federal budget. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3269.3s)]
*  I want to talk about the rest of it. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3270.7400000000002s)]
*  And, you know, we're adding, it took us 200 years as a country to add a trillion dollars [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3272.34s)]
*  to our federal debt to go from zero to a trillion. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3277.3s)]
*  And now we're adding a trillion every hundred days. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3280.1s)]
*  And it's going to take a lot more than just one to 3% cuts in spending [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3282.58s)]
*  to get us out of the, you know, the spiral that we're in. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3287.3s)]
*  I also am concerned very, I think very rightly so. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3290.98s)]
*  And I think he acknowledges the concerns that were mentioned by Larry Summers, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3296.66s)]
*  that tariffs plus tax cuts could lead to serious inflation and economic contraction. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3300.18s)]
*  Those are really difficult things to do together, unless you have [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3307.54s)]
*  a very clear plan for massively cutting spending at the federal level. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3311.3799999999997s)]
*  So I don't feel like I got to the heart of the matter on those points. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3315.46s)]
*  And as you guys know, that's what I care so deeply about. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3318.1s)]
*  I think we need to fix the machine to be able to do the things we want the machine to do over time. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3320.5s)]
*  And I'm very deeply worried about that. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3325.14s)]
*  You know, I had a couple of reactions to that. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3327.8599999999997s)]
*  So number one is I thought it was interesting how he reacted to the question about Larry Summers [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3329.7799999999997s)]
*  because he knows Larry Summers and he actually said several very [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3334.42s)]
*  very things towards him. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3336.9s)]
*  So he may not agree with him on everything, but he said that Larry had gotten a bunch of things right. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3339.14s)]
*  And he's an interesting guy. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3344.66s)]
*  And Larry did get the inflation call right. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3346.02s)]
*  Remember, at the very beginning of the Biden administration. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3348.74s)]
*  So it was interesting. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3351.54s)]
*  I thought that President Trump handled that question very tactfully. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3352.66s)]
*  I think it's not like he wasn't looking to attack anyone or anything like that. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3356.5s)]
*  Do we really buy he's going to do this terrorist thing anyway? [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3360.1s)]
*  Like it seems like that's a bit of pandering maybe to the voter base. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3362.42s)]
*  It sounds like a great solution, right. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3365.7799999999997s)]
*  But I don't think he's going to do it. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3367.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3368.8999999999996s)]
*  Once the economic advisors get together and look at the analysis and what this will do to costs of [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3369.22s)]
*  things, inflation will go up, et cetera. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3374.02s)]
*  You know, maybe there's a rethink ultimately on how that's implemented and on what particular [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3376.2599999999998s)]
*  slices of the economy it's implemented. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3380.42s)]
*  So I'm sure as you point out, it probably gets toned down for this to, you know, to even become [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3382.26s)]
*  a reality. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3386.82s)]
*  On the second piece on the deficit, you know, Jake, how you asked a pretty tough question there [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3388.6600000000003s)]
*  where you basically said, look, your your death, the debt has grown as much under your first term [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3392.5800000000004s)]
*  as it does under Biden. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3398.42s)]
*  Remember that the eight trillion or something? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3399.46s)]
*  It's almost exactly going to be the same. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3401.3s)]
*  Six point five to date from Biden, seven point eight trillion. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3403.1400000000003s)]
*  But I think he had a pretty good answer, which was that look at the first year of COVID, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3406.1000000000004s)]
*  we were dealing with, you know, a depression, a potential depression. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3410.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3413.54s)]
*  He mentioned that the economy GDP was down 30 percent. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3413.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3418.02s)]
*  He talked about 1929. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3418.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3419.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3420.1800000000003s)]
*  So he basically explained that we had to do that. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3420.9s)]
*  But then after that, we shouldn't have kept going. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3423.78s)]
*  And I do think that Trump is just not as big a spender as Biden. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3426.98s)]
*  I mean, look, Biden's been in Washington for 50 years. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3431.46s)]
*  He thinks government's the answer for everything. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3433.7000000000003s)]
*  He loves spending money. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3435.78s)]
*  And he spent trillions on COVID even after we didn't need to. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3437.3s)]
*  So I get the sense that Trump was a reluctant spender. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3440.42s)]
*  I'm not saying he didn't spend. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3444.02s)]
*  Whereas Biden, I think, is a eager spender. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3446.02s)]
*  And I think that any politician wants to spend because it's popular. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3449.46s)]
*  I just think it's their nature. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3454.98s)]
*  I think if Trump had the power by himself to rein in spending, I think he would. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3456.1800000000003s)]
*  I think the issue is that the president by himself can't do that much. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3460.1800000000003s)]
*  Which is what my follow up question was, right? [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3463.38s)]
*  I was trying to ask him, can you actually do it as president or not? [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3465.14s)]
*  Is there the wherewithal to do it? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3468.98s)]
*  I think the other aspect I wanted to see, I'm really glad he talked about de-dollarization. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3471.06s)]
*  And he mentioned it upfront. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3475.62s)]
*  And so that, to me, really resonated. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3477.22s)]
*  It really rings true to the effect of US spending, US foreign policy. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3480.18s)]
*  So much of this is driving. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3485.2999999999997s)]
*  And I'm concerned about driving the Saudis into the arms of the Chinese [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3486.74s)]
*  and other foreign adversaries to the United States. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3490.2599999999998s)]
*  And I would have really liked to have spent a little time with him on the Saudi relationship, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3494.02s)]
*  where he sees that headed. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3497.62s)]
*  How the Saudi relationship will affect the Middle East and how the Saudi relationship [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3498.98s)]
*  could affect the US dollar and dollar reserves around the world. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3502.98s)]
*  But I think he's acutely aware of de-dollarization and foreign reserves in dollars being sold down. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3506.98s)]
*  And that there are serious effects to that. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3514.1s)]
*  I didn't hear a follow up on what the specific responses will be to the drivers there, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3516.34s)]
*  which I would have loved to spend a little more time on. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3522.74s)]
*  Tomath, what do you think will be the viral moments to come out of this? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3524.74s)]
*  What do you think the mainstream media or social media will take from this? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3527.8599999999997s)]
*  Any moments you think were breaking news or notable? [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3531.54s)]
*  Well, I think there's a lot of clarity on a couple of important points. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3535.62s)]
*  One is no federal ban on abortion. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3538.8199999999997s)]
*  I think that that's important news for a lot of people. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3541.3799999999997s)]
*  The second is this clarity on H-1Bs, which is very different from what has to be done at the border. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3545.06s)]
*  I think that was very clear and new. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3551.2999999999997s)]
*  I think it's very positive for our community, meaning the tech industry. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3553.7s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3556.18s)]
*  That's why I pushed it. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3556.8199999999997s)]
*  We need that clarity because we're trying to hire these people and we are losing them every day. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3557.62s)]
*  And then the third was, I think the clarity on NATO was also very definitive. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3563.2999999999997s)]
*  I think that that's important. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3570.66s)]
*  The fourth, which was an implication of what he said, which is a little depressing, is [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3572.58s)]
*  I think there's a lot of us that want to see this Israeli-Palestinian conflict resolved. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3578.18s)]
*  And I think what he's saying is, we can't because we've let the genie out of the bottle. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3584.8199999999997s)]
*  We have an adversary now with a quarter of a trillion dollars of excess cash [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3589.62s)]
*  who has no incentive to negotiate. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3592.98s)]
*  Iran. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3595.54s)]
*  That's Iran. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3596.3399999999997s)]
*  So that's really depressing. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3597.4599999999996s)]
*  And then the fifth one was around this JFK thing. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3600.74s)]
*  The reason why I asked the JFK question is not necessarily that I have a specific [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3603.3s)]
*  interest in JFK, but it's emblematic of, it's a proxy for this deep state, this idea of secrets, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3608.6600000000003s)]
*  or this idea of there's a layer of people that are embedded in the United States government [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3615.7000000000003s)]
*  that decides on behalf of all of us. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3621.1400000000003s)]
*  And I think when you have somebody who can push back against that [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3623.86s)]
*  and use transparency and sunlight as the cleansing function, that is what we need. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3627.78s)]
*  If we're going to rebuild trust in our government and institutions, [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3632.74s)]
*  we're going to need a lot more transparency. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3635.4599999999996s)]
*  And if that one's hanging out there, why not resolve it? [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3637.22s)]
*  I mean, did he say he thinks the CIA did it? [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3639.9399999999996s)]
*  I think I heard him say that. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3642.8999999999996s)]
*  I think the CIA did it. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3644.02s)]
*  What I heard was he said the CIA was behind the people that were influencing him not to. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3645.06s)]
*  No, I think what he said was the CIA was... [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3650.5s)]
*  They didn't want the information out. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3651.7s)]
*  He thought the CIA... [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3652.58s)]
*  Yeah, we should be clear about that because it could be quoted out of context. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3652.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to need to see the transcript on that. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3656.1s)]
*  He did not say that he thought the CIA was behind the asset. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3657.7799999999997s)]
*  He didn't come anywhere close. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3660.58s)]
*  He said that he thought the CIA was behind the influence that we're telling him to not do it. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3661.86s)]
*  And he listened to them out of trust and respect for them, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3666.98s)]
*  which I think that's a reasonable judgment in the moment. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3669.38s)]
*  Yeah, and we've got to see that transcript, too. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3671.6200000000003s)]
*  My point is exposing that is a very important way of giving the influence and power back to the people. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3673.94s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3681.3s)]
*  I've mentioned this quote from Mike Pompeo, which is really powerful, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3682.26s)]
*  but it's something to the effect of the people on the top floor of the CIA [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3686.34s)]
*  do not believe it's a Democrat or a Republican that runs America, but that they do. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3691.94s)]
*  And he said that in the context of being asked, what is the one regret you have [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3698.98s)]
*  or some of the biggest regrets you have in running the CIA? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3704.1s)]
*  And Pompeo said that he didn't fix that. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3708.5s)]
*  So I think that there's a lot of embedded versions of this establishment class that [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3711.06s)]
*  lurk in many institutions, whether it's the EPA, whether it's the CIA, whether it's the NIH, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3716.34s)]
*  and if there are ways in which the president can unlock the data that's necessary or the information [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3722.58s)]
*  for all of us to have a little bit more clarity on what's happening, I think it's important. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3730.58s)]
*  And I do think for many people that the JFK file is representative of a lot of them. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3735.46s)]
*  Well, and then Dovetailing that, Sax, the Fauci discussion where he said, I don't trust, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3741.46s)]
*  I never trusted Fauci and then kind of pushing it on like, hey, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3746.82s)]
*  do you think it should be prosecuted? Did we fund it or not? [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3750.02s)]
*  Seems pretty clear. He believes we funded data research. His position was, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3753.06s)]
*  I just didn't want to spend the money, which I appreciate about it. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3756.98s)]
*  With China. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3759.62s)]
*  With China, yeah. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3760.5s)]
*  Spend the money in China. Yeah. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3761.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And so what did you think of that point? [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3762.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3766.34s)]
*  Well, I thought that his response on that was similar to a lot of his responses, which is he [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3766.82s)]
*  did not take the edgy position that he was sort of being teed up to take. I mean, kind of like same [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3773.14s)]
*  thing with like the Larry Summers thing. You know, he had mild criticism, I thought, for Fauci, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3779.46s)]
*  but he didn't go scorched earth at all on Fauci there. And I would just say- [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3784.58s)]
*  Wait, so he didn't trust him? He said, I don't trust him. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3788.82s)]
*  Well, yeah, absolutely. Nobody- [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3790.5s)]
*  That's pretty scorched earth for politics. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3791.78s)]
*  No, nobody trusts Fauci. You asked him whether Fauci should be prosecuted. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3793.94s)]
*  He did not take the bait on that. That's my point. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3799.2200000000003s)]
*  He was very respectful, actually. I was very surprised to hear how he respected Fauci [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3800.82s)]
*  and how he framed his response to that question. And I think that says a lot. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3806.66s)]
*  But can I tell you why you're surprised? Because I think we have been fed, this is what I'm saying. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3810.5s)]
*  We have been fed a narrative of what President Trump looks like. Now, in fairness, we're also [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3815.22s)]
*  being fed a narrative of what President Biden is like. And this is why you have to see these men [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3819.7s)]
*  up close and personal for yourself. Because David, the fact that you're surprised is less about the [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3825.14s)]
*  fact that Donald Trump has changed. It's more the fact that you've been told a narrative and [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3830.42s)]
*  you've believed it. And so now when you see the actual truth, you have to re-underwrite, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3835.78s)]
*  hold on a second. He's actually pretty thoughtful. He's pretty presidential. He doesn't go off on [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3839.7000000000003s)]
*  people. That's not what you probably thought going in because that's not what the mainstream [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3844.42s)]
*  media portrays about what you should be thinking about. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3849.38s)]
*  Well, in fairness, he has gone in on people pretty hard over the last eight years. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3851.78s)]
*  He's a counterpuncher. I don't think he hits people unless they hit him first. I mean, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3854.9s)]
*  that's his pattern. But look, I agree with Trimoth here that my overall take on this, [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3858.26s)]
*  and look, my position is clear because I wrote a long post on X endorsing Trump a couple weeks ago. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3864.9s)]
*  But everything I heard here in this interview is consistent with the reasons why I stated I [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3871.06s)]
*  want to support him. He clearly favors a pro-growth agenda. He wants to keep taxes low and reasonable. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3876.42s)]
*  He wants to reduce regulations. He wanted to increase the number of H1Bs, get the Dream Team [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3883.86s)]
*  over here for tech while sealing the border, while cutting down on crime in blue cities. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3890.9s)]
*  He talked about how crime was out of control. He wants to negotiate peace deals. He, I think, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3897.54s)]
*  understands very well why we have this war going on in Europe. Overall, I heard a lot of [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3902.9s)]
*  reassuring things, and I didn't hear anything that I would put in the category of a grievance [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3909.78s)]
*  or a desire for revenge. The media is trying to portray him as like [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3916.42s)]
*  seeking vengeance or something like that. Well, that's because he says he is. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3921.38s)]
*  Didn't get that vibe at all. He said over and over again, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3924.7400000000002s)]
*  let's be clear, he said over again, I will be your retribution. So he may not have said it on this [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3927.78s)]
*  podcast. Did you get any of that in this interview? No, I've just heard him say it 50 times in the last [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3931.7000000000003s)]
*  60 days. So, but Sax, where would you like to have seen him be stronger? Maybe the same clip played [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3937.94s)]
*  over and over again on CNN? Where would you like to have seen him be stronger or different [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3942.82s)]
*  on any of his major positions? What would you as his advisor advise him to shift or double down on [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3946.5800000000004s)]
*  a bit? Well, I mean, I think Chamath is right that with respect to the Middle East, I think his [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3953.38s)]
*  position isn't perfectly clear because it's not only about Iran in the Middle East, right? [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3962.26s)]
*  But the truth of the matter is politically, I don't know that he could say more. And, you know, [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3968.58s)]
*  I think that's just a very, very tough issue where you're bound to alienate and polarize [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3972.8999999999996s)]
*  one side or the other. And so I think he's sort of definitely walking a tightrope there. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3977.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. When he says it would never have happened, like I'm always like, you know, like it would never [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3982.66s)]
*  happen to me. I would like to have a little more of the why. Why do you believe that? And he never [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3986.74s)]
*  gets into the details. He just says that over and over. But maybe he's right. You know, like, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3991.22s)]
*  when I hear talk, what I hear is someone who's a dealmaker, he was a dealmaker in business. Now [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=3996.2599999999998s)]
*  he's a dealmaker politically. He's willing to have conversations with anybody. There was even a [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4001.94s)]
*  moment when he's talking about Iran, where he said maybe he could have worked out a deal. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4006.66s)]
*  But in any event, he's somebody who I think is willing to negotiate, which I think is a [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4012.5s)]
*  positive thing because once last time Biden negotiated anything. He doesn't seem interested [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4018.4199999999996s)]
*  at all. I mean, I didn't get to ask, but you know, one of the things I had chewed up was, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4022.82s)]
*  you know, I just think you've done a phenomenal job in talking to people who most people feel are [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4026.98s)]
*  difficult people to get along with, you know, Kim Jong Un, Xi, Putin, I think it's the superpowers [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4031.54s)]
*  talking to dictators, despots, people who are cantankerous and difficult, and he always seems to [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4038.1800000000003s)]
*  get the better of them, or at least get at least gets our interest as Americans aligned with [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4044.6600000000003s)]
*  whatever their interests are. So I think, yeah, let me ask you, give him a plus on that. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4052.18s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want to be insulting. I'm asking like in the past, you said that he was embracing [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4055.7s)]
*  the dictators and he was kowtowing to that. I think you've said comments like that in the past [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4059.8599999999997s)]
*  where you saw this. Yes, or something that felt like he was more trying to embrace and engage with [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4063.8599999999997s)]
*  them in a way that's like, why would you? I've always felt you should talk to everybody all [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4070.3399999999997s)]
*  the time. You know, that's not my issue with Trump. You know, it's never been my issue with him. I [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4073.2999999999997s)]
*  think that's a superpower. The fact that he went into North Korea and stepped over in the DMZ, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4077.3s)]
*  you saw the look on Kim Jong Un's face. He just Kim Jong Un just wants a little attention. He [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4083.2200000000003s)]
*  wants a little recognition. And this idea like we're not going to give him any recognition is [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4087.54s)]
*  stupid. Because if you give him a little recognition, now you're sort of tilting him towards, [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4092.1800000000003s)]
*  hey, maybe you could be part of this, like maybe you could come to the West and see a movie premiere [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4096.66s)]
*  or come to the NBA finals, as opposed to start lobbying, you know, dysfunctional missiles over [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4100.5s)]
*  Japan, like me. You know, that video where they're like setting up the little press shooting in the [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4107.14s)]
*  in the conference room with Oh, my God, that video is so funny. Jong Un's face when Trump says video, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4112.820000000001s)]
*  you want me to go over? I go. Should I go over? Should I do it? Now? I go over. Okay. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4117.9400000000005s)]
*  And Kim Jong Un is beaming and you're like, he just played him. He played him. Like he walked 10 [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4124.820000000001s)]
*  feet into North Korea. And now Kim Jong Un's like, you know, I don't need this. My big unanswered [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4130.18s)]
*  question. I did want to ask him about like, Dalio's prediction of like the cycle of empires 500 [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4135.22s)]
*  years, six years. Well, let's play counterfactual free broke. What do you what do you how do you [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4140.5s)]
*  compare the answers you've heard to what you have heard or what you think President Biden's answers [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4146.1s)]
*  would be to the things that you care about? I honestly feel like there's a little bit of a [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4151.3s)]
*  blind earth to the question. Like there's a pivot back to what I've done, what I'll do versus the [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4155.38s)]
*  like, let's actually talk about where we are in the debt cycle. And this is exactly what like [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4160.5s)]
*  history repeating itself. At the time that you take on all the debt, you drive internal conflict. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4167.46s)]
*  January 6 is a great like data point. You drive external conflict. We've had two or three wars [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4172.74s)]
*  start in the last four years. How do we reverse those things so that we don't repeat history? [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4178.1s)]
*  And we sat down with Dali and we asked him this question, is there a way to not repeat history? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4183.86s)]
*  And he said, yes, there is. And we talked with Graham Allison about this. And all these guys [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4187.62s)]
*  believe that there's a way to avoid it. There have been moments where we've nearly had the [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4191.46s)]
*  external conflict. And that's why I asked him about war with China. But I want to understand [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4195.14s)]
*  if there is this broader kind of construct of what is going on, because he he hits on all the data [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4198.98s)]
*  points correctly, de dollarization, increased spending, bloated bureaucracy, conflicts around [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4204.26s)]
*  the world, without taking it all into perspective and saying, man, like, this is where empires die. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4210.74s)]
*  I guess he does say that, right? He does actually highlight exactly what Dali doesn't do. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4215.7s)]
*  What does though, right? Like, Malay has said to the populace, that's exactly. Yeah. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4219.94s)]
*  Malay, he just needs to take that next Malay step and say, I will cut half the people working at [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4224.82s)]
*  these places. He kind of did say it when it came to education. I don't know what your interpretations [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4229.38s)]
*  were, gentlemen, back to an entrepreneurial economy, right? Allow capital. I think he did say [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4234.179999999999s)]
*  around regulation. And then with respect to the bureaucracy, he pointed to education. Yeah, [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4238.58s)]
*  good example. Energy, he pointed to the EPA. The right things are on his radar screen. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4244.74s)]
*  Yeah, I just hope he gets the right people around him, Sacks. Like, yeah, I mean, I mean, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4250.5s)]
*  no more Julianis and stupid people. You gotta if you're gonna put him put smart people around him. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4255.3s)]
*  Cabinet and advisors. Here's the thing. On the regulation and nuclear on AI, like, yeah, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4262.820000000001s)]
*  in 2016, there was not the kind of people that, for example, were at this fundraiser, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4268.42s)]
*  that David and I organized, was, I think, entirely different than what you saw in 2016. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4276.18s)]
*  And I do think there's an opportunity where if you dipped your hand like there was a young man [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4284.26s)]
*  in the audience, who answered this AI question, and he talked about public key, private key [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4288.34s)]
*  cryptography, it was beautiful. It was amazing. Very technical person. But there are all these [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4294.02s)]
*  people that are coming out of the woodwork. To your point, Freeberg, if he can figure out how [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4300.740000000001s)]
*  to build a cabinet with those people, meaning these extremely technical, thoughtful people, [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4305.46s)]
*  then there's a real shot that you can change. Yeah, I hope that's right. I pulled up some [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4312.1s)]
*  some data going into our conversation. I just want to hear read this to you guys. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4315.540000000001s)]
*  Totally off topic. But I just want to say we can cut it out if you want. But, you know, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4318.9800000000005s)]
*  construction for the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which is 1.6 miles long, when it was built in [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4323.7s)]
*  1977, was 141 million bucks, about 740 million in today's dollars. Today, they're estimating to [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4328.34s)]
*  repair, you know, that's the bridge that collapsed in Baltimore. They're saying it's going to cost, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4335.0599999999995s)]
*  you know, $2 billion or more to repair that bridge now, you know, 40 years later, [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4339.3s)]
*  California's bullet train project in 2008 was supposed to cost 40 billion. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4344.34s)]
*  We're 15 years into this thing. We've spent 18 billion. They're now asking for 140 billion [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4348.5s)]
*  total to build 171 mile track. That's a billion a mile. Let me just tell you this other fact. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4353.46s)]
*  And the tracks are in the middle of nowhere. Yeah. And China just spent 300 billion to build 16,000 [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4360.5s)]
*  miles of high speed rail. They're spending 18 million a mile. That's 2% of the cost of the [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4366.5s)]
*  California high speed rail system, 2% per mile. We are 50 times more expensive than China. That [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4373.3s)]
*  is where superpowers shift. That is where that is the fundamental premise of the shift that we've [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4379.06s)]
*  seen five, six times in the last 500 years. That's the question for the president. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4384.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, is it just time to privatize all that stuff? [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4388.820000000001s)]
*  It's layers of, you know. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4391.860000000001s)]
*  Of these two men, Trump or Biden, which one do you think is going to be more [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4394.26s)]
*  skeptical of big government spending? And which one is going to be more interested in being [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4397.38s)]
*  conducive to the private sector solving problems? I mean, to me, there's no comparison. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4402.42s)]
*  Well, which one do you think? [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4407.46s)]
*  Obviously, Trump is all of his instincts are let's empower the private sector. Let's cut [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4408.98s)]
*  regulations. Let's make taxes reasonable. Let's get the smartest people in the country. Let's have [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4414.42s)]
*  peace deals. Let's have growth. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4419.46s)]
*  What do you think, Fieber? [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4422.98s)]
*  I have heard conversations that there is an economic argument. I don't know if I buy it, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4424.099999999999s)]
*  that one of the reasons that they're trying to leave the border open is there is a low cost [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4429.46s)]
*  labor pool that grows that actually is beneficial to economic growth that there's just not enough [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4435.46s)]
*  in the workforce today to like think about the cost of building that railroad in China versus [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4441.3s)]
*  the US. You know, the average income in the US is a couple turns on what it is in China. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4445.46s)]
*  You can also say you don't want to answer the question. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4452.66s)]
*  Between the two? [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4455.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4457.06s)]
*  Ask this question more specifically. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4459.94s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, honestly. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4461.94s)]
*  Who do you think is closer to your desired outcome? Trump or Biden? [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4463.46s)]
*  I think Trump hits on it like way more than Biden does. Yeah, he definitely hits on the [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4467.06s)]
*  concerns that I have. I don't know if he has like the path that makes me feel like, great, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4471.54s)]
*  let's like this is going to work. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4475.86s)]
*  Does Biden? [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4477.22s)]
*  Does Biden? [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4477.78s)]
*  And I think the other thing I worry about is the leadership problem with Trump, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4478.58s)]
*  meaning I don't mean him as a leader in terms of effectiveness, but just this like [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4481.94s)]
*  Trump derangement syndrome is not something to be ignored and to be disparaging of the people that [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4487.06s)]
*  not we all, but people say have Trump derangement syndrome. It's a fundamental like tilting that he [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4494.02s)]
*  does. And he tilts half the people in the country. He tilts them. And I think that that is really, [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4498.26s)]
*  and maybe the other side is true as well. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4503.3s)]
*  Maybe it's a psychological problem that a lot of people have. It doesn't mean we should have a [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4504.740000000001s)]
*  worse president. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4507.9400000000005s)]
*  No, so that's one argument. Or maybe when he tried, maybe there's a way to use unifying speech [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4508.5s)]
*  instead of divisive speech. And that is my other concern is just like, or you speak directly to [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4515.54s)]
*  the people and you end up where Jake Al is at and where you're at, which is you've heard him [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4520.82s)]
*  face to face really for the first time. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4529.0599999999995s)]
*  I want to hear Biden face to face. I want to have a long conversation. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4532.0199999999995s)]
*  I would look at Biden on here. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4534.58s)]
*  I totally agree. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4535.78s)]
*  We invited Biden on here too. And we're waiting breathlessly for him to accept the invitation. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4536.74s)]
*  You got to give Trump credit for coming on the show, like he said, and took all questions. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4541.38s)]
*  So you got to give Trump a lot of credit for that. But Freeberg, to your point about the TDS for a [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4548.74s)]
*  second, look, when Biden ran in 2020, he promised a return to normalcy. That was basically his sales [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4552.82s)]
*  pitch. We had just gone through COVID. There were a lot of people who had TDS or were tilted by Trump. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4561.139999999999s)]
*  And what Biden said is we're going to have normalcy. What actually happened? Well, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4567.62s)]
*  I think Biden began this incredibly partisan and vindictive program of lawfare, of trying to [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4572.820000000001s)]
*  prosecute not just Trump, but a lot of other people. We had the border basically opened up. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4578.42s)]
*  I mean, Biden repealed all those executive orders on day one and did create those holes in the wall. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4584.580000000001s)]
*  There was absolutely no reason for that. We had this war in Ukraine that was easily avoidable if [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4590.34s)]
*  they just said the right things back in 2021. I mean, I could go on. I mean, on the issue of tech, [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4595.54s)]
*  like we talked about, everyone feels frozen right now. Crypto can't get a regulatory framework. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4603.3s)]
*  No one can do M&A. So have we gotten the normalcy that we were promised? I don't think so. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4608.1s)]
*  And on the other hand, what I heard from Trump in this interview was like he was sort of softened. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4613.46s)]
*  He did not go scorched earth, even when he invited him to. He did not [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4620.0199999999995s)]
*  say prosecute Fauci. I will agree. I will agree with you on that. He had nice words to say about [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4624.26s)]
*  Larry Summers. Yes. He was, you know, I thought this was a very moderate sounding Trump. Maybe [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4628.42s)]
*  it's a different approach and I'm wrong and I'm just referencing the history with him. And I do [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4635.38s)]
*  agree with you that the way he spoke today about people that have been antagonistic about him or [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4639.38s)]
*  to him like Larry Summers and Fauci did surprise me, particularly after years of him sending out [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4644.26s)]
*  these tweets every morning about people that are antagonistic about him. And it was quite [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4649.86s)]
*  refreshing, honestly, and it felt different. So, you know, I will give him credit on that point. I [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4653.94s)]
*  will like agree with you on that, for sure. The point is, I think that we had an opportunity [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4658.58s)]
*  to interview the president of the United States. And that was great. Congrats. I think we talked [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4663.219999999999s)]
*  about a broad spectrum of issues. I wish we had more time. I think he answered them precisely. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4666.82s)]
*  And I think he was candid. And I think that he gave us new information, which I think is important. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4672.9s)]
*  And I think it allowed you guys to see what I saw, which is if you're an independent [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4679.86s)]
*  or not a Republican, quote unquote, by name, and you have a preconceived notion of what [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4687.86s)]
*  President Trump is like, it's very difficult to keep that notion is my point, after you hear him [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4694.98s)]
*  and after you meet him. And I think that that's a very important thing to keep in mind, because I [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4701.139999999999s)]
*  don't think it says as much about President Trump as it does about the lens with which we are taught [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4706.26s)]
*  to think about all of these people, including President Biden. So I would just say, you got [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4712.5s)]
*  to think for yourself. And that's the most important takeaway. And I think that we are giving people [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4719.14s)]
*  ground truth data to underwrite your own opinion. All right, everybody, this has been another amazing [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4724.5s)]
*  episode of the All In Podcast. Thank you, David Sacks, for getting President Trump to come on. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4729.62s)]
*  President Biden, you are of course invited to come on. We encourage you to come on. Give us 50 [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4732.98s)]
*  minutes, give us an hour and a half, whatever you got. No, we've asked, we've asked, we're waiting. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4737.86s)]
*  I'm just restating it for the record. Had if you by some means, somebody in this group says we should, [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4741.54s)]
*  you know, talk to the All In team since they're a top 10 podcast and every other presidential [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4748.0199999999995s)]

*  the group. I don't think he can keep up. That's the big challenge for the Rain Man, David Sacks, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqIZGXWUpU&t=4755.7s)]
