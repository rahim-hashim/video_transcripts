*  How many tickets are we selling? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=181.83999999999997s)]
*  Not enough. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=184.16s)]
*  Not enough. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=185.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=186.16s)]

*  You got it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=191.04s)]
*  I'm going to tell you this math. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=192.44s)]
*  How big is the theater and what are we charging for the tickets? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=193.44s)]
*  Well, it's not a theater. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=196.44s)]
*  So there's like the tickets are like 500 bucks. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=197.44s)]
*  I love you being the moderator and taking all the arrows. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=199.44s)]
*  This is great. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=202.16s)]
*  It's not a theater. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=203.16s)]
*  I think we're moderating again. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=204.16s)]
*  Well, it's the PFA. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=205.16s)]
*  Remember where they used to have the Exploratorium, that building where they built for the World's [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=206.16s)]
*  Fair or whatever. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=211.16s)]
*  So it's in there and it's all empty. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=212.66s)]
*  So we're kind of taking that. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=214.34s)]
*  We're building a stage inside. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=215.34s)]
*  We're going to build all the set and everything. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=216.34s)]
*  Yeah, it should be fun. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=218.34s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=219.84s)]
*  Sounds great. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  If you could take some pictures, Saks would love to see. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  Unless it's Mar-a-Lago, Saks will not show up. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  I want to just congratulate. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=229.84s)]
*  It's like, oh, we're spending a million dollars and I won't be there. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=230.84s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  Keep going. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  I want to congratulate someone really special without whom Trump would likely not have been [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=237.64000000000001s)]
*  elected president. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=241.76s)]
*  So your bravery, your ingenuity, your creativity, you led the way and you brought millions of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=244.02s)]
*  people the direct news they couldn't get anywhere else. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=249.16s)]
*  Jason, congrats. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=251.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=252.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=253.76s)]
*  By putting the All In pod, you've inadvertently architected a system that's helped return [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=254.76s)]
*  Trump to the White House. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=258.0s)]
*  And for that, many people are praising you today. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=259.08s)]
*  Congrats, Jason. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=261.96s)]
*  How does it feel to have finally accomplished your dream? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=262.96s)]
*  Feels great. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=265.36s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=266.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=267.36s)]
*  Big shout out to J. Cal. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=268.36s)]
*  I just see a tweet where somebody gave me a lot of credit for moving the Overton window [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=269.36s)]
*  in Silicon Valley and they said that Jason was indispensable as my foil. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=272.5s)]
*  If I didn't have him to dunk on for four years with my political takes, it wouldn't have [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=277.24s)]
*  been nearly as effective. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=281.44s)]
*  So thank you for that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=282.44s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=283.44s)]
*  Yeah, my pleasure. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=284.44s)]
*  I'm here for you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=285.44s)]
*  I am avid to your hostellar. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=286.44s)]
*  Your internal MSM debating partner. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=288.0s)]
*  We need someone to represent the legacy media point of view. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=291.36s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  So let's kick it off. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=297.15999999999997s)]
*  Sax, you were at Mar-a-Lago on election night. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  I thought it'd just be great if you could tell us a little bit about what the scene [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=300.24s)]
*  was like, how was it? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=303.32s)]
*  When did you guys know that Trump had the victory in the bag? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  Was it pre the polls coming in because you had pollster data early? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=309.6s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about the experience there and when it all came together. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=314.44s)]
*  Yeah, I went over there, I guess around 730, I want to say, Eastern time. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=317.68s)]
*  Tucker invited me to come on his show. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=323.12s)]
*  Tucker was doing a live stream from the library at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=324.92s)]
*  I'd actually never been over there before. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=327.8s)]
*  There was also a dinner going on in the ballroom, which was, I think, primarily for Mar-a-Lago [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=329.92s)]
*  members and there were some senators there, members of the campaign. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=335.24s)]
*  And then there was another room set up with a bunch of TVs for basically the staff to [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=340.04s)]
*  watch the results come in. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=345.18s)]
*  When I first got there, people were just watching, trying to find out the early results. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=347.76s)]
*  I would say that the whispers were positive, but people didn't fumbly know more than the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=353.0s)]
*  rest of us. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=359.8s)]
*  Everyone was waiting for the results to come in. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=360.8s)]
*  I did get a chance to take a photo with the president. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  Actually Elon came in separately around the same time and we got a very memorable photograph [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=367.32s)]
*  here. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=371.92s)]
*  When I shook the president's hand, I got to tell you, he was cool as a cucumber. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=373.48s)]
*  He did not seem nervous at all. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=377.0s)]
*  Did he feel confident like he had it in the bag? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=378.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think he was confident, but I don't think he was acting like he had it in the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=379.96000000000004s)]
*  bag or anything like that. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=383.12s)]
*  They didn't know yet, but he was just super, super relaxed and calm and taking photos with [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=384.12s)]
*  everyone. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=390.03999999999996s)]
*  He was in a good mood. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  So you remember the moment when his hand touched yours? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=392.03999999999996s)]
*  Take us to that moment. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=394.03999999999996s)]
*  Just unpack it a little bit. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm just saying, though. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=396.4s)]
*  Did he give you the shake? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=397.4s)]
*  He gives that little shake to exert a little dominance. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=398.4s)]
*  Did he give you the shake? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=401.28s)]
*  It was just a normal handshake, but my point is I could detect no nervousness whatsoever [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=402.88s)]
*  on his part. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  And look, the rest of us were nervous. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=409.96s)]
*  We were wondering what was going to happen. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=411.96s)]
*  The whole country was nervous. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=413.96s)]
*  And what were you guys doing? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=416.32s)]
*  You were hanging out, having cocktails, having dinner, just everyone was meandering, chilling. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=417.44s)]
*  What's the scene like at Mar-a-Lago? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=421.4s)]
*  There's a dinner in the ballroom. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=423.48s)]
*  Actually, I saw Jared there. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=424.48s)]
*  Jared was very nice to me. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=425.8s)]
*  He asked me, do you want to sit down at the dinner? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=427.32s)]
*  And I could have joined him, but then I decided to do the live stream with you guys. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=430.4s)]
*  And I pulled in Don Jr. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=433.36s)]
*  And we did the live stream with Don Jr. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=434.36s)]
*  Like I said- [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=438.12s)]
*  Are you officially a Mar-a-Lago member, by the way? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=439.12s)]
*  No. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=441.12s)]
*  For 500 Large? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=442.12s)]
*  Oh my Lord. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=443.12s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=444.12s)]
*  500,000? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=445.12s)]
*  Well, that's what Don Jr. told us. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=446.12s)]
*  I mean, I don't live in Palm Beach. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=447.92s)]
*  I think the Palm Beach community is members of Mar-a-Lago. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=449.52s)]
*  So I think that there were, you know, it wasn't a huge group of people at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=454.32s)]
*  And really all the supporters were convened at the Convention Center in Palm Beach. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=460.2s)]
*  There were thousands of people there. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=464.08s)]
*  I think originally they had talked about doing an election night party at Mar-a-Lago, but [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=466.24s)]
*  it just got too big. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=470.24s)]
*  So they moved it to the Convention Center. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=471.28000000000003s)]
*  So I don't know, whatever it was that I dropped off the live stream with you guys, I then [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=473.52s)]
*  moved to the Convention Center, got back on with Newt. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=478.0s)]
*  And then we were kind of waiting at the Convention Center. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=482.32s)]
*  We were all feeling good increasingly so throughout the night. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=484.96s)]
*  I would say that when Pennsylvania finally got called, then I think everyone knew that [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=487.44s)]
*  it was in the bag at that point. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=491.88s)]
*  And it was just a matter of time before the election got called for Trump. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=493.68s)]
*  And then, you know, at some point they kind of herded us downstairs into that large ballroom [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=498.38s)]
*  where Trump gave his victory speech with the rest of the campaign staff. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=503.7s)]
*  So the final tally it looks like is going to be 312 electoral college votes for President [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=508.54s)]
*  Donald Trump versus Kamala Harris's 226. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=514.86s)]
*  Just for context, in 2016, Trump won with 304 electoral votes and Biden won in 2020 [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=519.5s)]
*  with 306. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=525.98s)]
*  So it's a pretty sweeping victory. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=527.78s)]
*  He won all the supposed swing states this year fairly resoundingly. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=529.42s)]
*  There's no real super close calls. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=534.8199999999999s)]
*  There's some close calls, but pretty resounding victory. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=536.14s)]
*  Chamath, what happened? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=539.38s)]
*  Wow, it's a really good question. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=541.8199999999999s)]
*  I think that there's many layers of the answer. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=544.9s)]
*  But I think in its most basic calculation, I think that the bottom fell out of the Democratic [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=550.36s)]
*  Party. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=555.26s)]
*  And if you look at why, there's a simple explanation and then there's the more nuanced explanation. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=557.22s)]
*  I think the simple explanation is like they just lost the script. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=566.5799999999999s)]
*  I think that there was so many people that just got really tired of being spoken at and [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=571.3s)]
*  labeled. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=580.9s)]
*  Misogynist, racist, fascist, transphobe, whatever it was. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=583.9s)]
*  And there was just these litany of these judgmental labels that would come out instead of engaging [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=589.66s)]
*  on the topics at hand. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=595.3s)]
*  So I think the Democratic Party played this game of trying to use identities, genders, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=597.3s)]
*  races as a bid to basically get people that they thought should always vote in their direction [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=604.74s)]
*  to continue to support them. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=612.1800000000001s)]
*  And instead, what happened was people just started to think for themselves and say, hold [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=613.5s)]
*  on a second. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=616.66s)]
*  I'm just a normal person that wants to be left alone. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=617.94s)]
*  What matters to me? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=620.1800000000001s)]
*  And I think what Donald Trump spoke to was a desire for folks to have economic prosperity, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=621.78s)]
*  a safe neighborhood, a predictable educational curriculum where these kids could go to school, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=628.8199999999999s)]
*  not be indoctrinated and come out the other side and just know some useful skills so that [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=635.1s)]
*  they could get a good job and do better than they did. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=638.9s)]
*  And all these basic truths ended up on the ballot. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=641.78s)]
*  And so it was a bunch of perception versus just a bunch of hard realities. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=645.22s)]
*  And I think Trump stayed focused and ultimately made sure that people understood that that's [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=649.66s)]
*  what he was focused on. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=656.3s)]
*  And I think the Democrats just went to this place of demagoguery and labels. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=658.3399999999999s)]
*  And I think it was just a resounding defeat. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=663.66s)]
*  And David, I just want you to like just to put a pin on how resounding it is. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=666.02s)]
*  In California and New York, which I would say are the two most prolific bastions of [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=672.18s)]
*  elitist liberal thinking, Democrats won those states in some of the narrowest margins they've [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=678.4599999999999s)]
*  ever seen. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=686.58s)]
*  I think in 2020, they won California by 29 points. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=687.58s)]
*  It was barely half is what they won by this year. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=693.0600000000001s)]
*  In New York, it shrunk to a 12-point margin. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=696.5400000000001s)]
*  So what is this telling you? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=699.86s)]
*  It's telling you that the Democrats really need to retool and get back to first principles. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=701.1s)]
*  It was a cataclysmic dismissal of wokeism, of cancel culture, of judgmentalism. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=704.94s)]
*  It was a ringing endorsement of a meritocracy, of just plain, simple common sense of talking [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=715.9s)]
*  with people and to people, being able to tolerate disagreements, remaining friends. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=723.98s)]
*  All of those things were on the ballot. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=732.4599999999999s)]
*  And it was just an absolute resounding victory for just normalcy. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=733.9399999999999s)]
*  That's what I think we saw. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=738.74s)]
*  We saw a return to normalcy. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=739.78s)]
*  Jason, do you think that that message got across more clearly in this election than [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=742.7399999999999s)]
*  ever before, as some have claimed, because of the power of alternative media for reaching [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=748.38s)]
*  the audience, rather than having everything pushed through reporters in traditional legacy [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=754.9799999999999s)]
*  media? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=759.8199999999999s)]
*  In this case, many of the candidates, particularly on the Republican side, went direct to the [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=760.8199999999999s)]
*  audience through long-form podcasts like ours, but also Joe Rogan and Lex and many others. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=765.66s)]
*  Did that move the needle for a lot of people in a way that won this, or was it the policies [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=771.22s)]
*  and the difference alone? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=775.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=776.98s)]
*  Well, clearly, being on podcasts was a major part of Trump's strategy that people are starting [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=777.98s)]
*  to report on right now. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=783.5400000000001s)]
*  And in media, you go where the audience is. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=785.4200000000001s)]
*  And I think the Democrats just didn't get that. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=788.58s)]
*  Now, stepping back, I think the number one problem here is the candidate that the Democrats [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=790.62s)]
*  put up. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=796.98s)]
*  And probably the close number two is inflation. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=798.38s)]
*  And the economy, as we all know, it's the economy, stupid. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=801.9799999999999s)]
*  If you were paying $2 for a cheeseburger at McDonald's and now it's $4, that's what people [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=807.42s)]
*  are going to remember. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=813.4599999999999s)]
*  And the inflation that occurred over this last four years was huge. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=814.8599999999999s)]
*  And people cited that over and over and over again. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=820.0999999999999s)]
*  So there's probably three buckets you could put this conversation into. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=823.9s)]
*  First, the candidate, Kamala Harris, was a terrible candidate. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=827.38s)]
*  She was put in at the last minute and she was anointed and she didn't go through a proper [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=830.7s)]
*  primary. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=835.34s)]
*  I think that's probably number one in this entire thing. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=836.34s)]
*  It was a terrible thing. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=839.22s)]
*  You're saying number one is the candidate. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=840.22s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=841.94s)]
*  Number one is the candidate. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=842.94s)]
*  Number two, I think, because remember, Trump was incredibly unpopular as well. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=844.38s)]
*  And all credit to Trump for winning and running an incredible campaign. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=848.3000000000001s)]
*  I mean, just they crushed it. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=851.6600000000001s)]
*  And then number three is the bucket that Chamath started with, which is the country really, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=855.22s)]
*  really does not like being told that they're racist or sexist, etc. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=862.62s)]
*  Cancel culture. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=868.5s)]
*  And you put those three things together. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=869.5s)]
*  One of the things that's coming out right now is some of the things that are being said [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=872.5s)]
*  about the country, the country's economy, the country's economy, the country's economy, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=876.98s)]
*  One of the things that's coming out right now is some of the ads. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=882.46s)]
*  And we'll play an ad here. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=885.82s)]
*  I wanted you guys to see this. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=886.9s)]
*  I think this ad sums up exactly how bad Kamala was. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=888.26s)]
*  And we'll combine this ad with just some of the statistics that have come out of how many [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=893.0600000000001s)]
*  people have gone right. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=897.82s)]
*  This is Charlamagne the God from the Breakfast Club, for those who don't know, in a Donald [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=898.82s)]
*  Trump ad. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=903.14s)]
*  What taxpayer funded sex changes for prisoners? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=904.82s)]
*  Surgery. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=907.94s)]
*  For prisoners. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=908.94s)]
*  For prisoners. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=909.94s)]
*  Every transgender inmate in the prison system would have access. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=911.2600000000001s)]
*  Hell no, I don't want my taxpayer dollars going to that. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=915.74s)]
*  Kamala supports transgender sex changes in jail with our money. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=918.74s)]
*  Kamala even supports letting biological men compete against our girls in their sports. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=921.98s)]
*  Kamala is for they, them. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=928.0600000000001s)]
*  President Trump is for you. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=929.94s)]
*  I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=931.58s)]
*  And so how does Kamala come back from this with black voters, with male voters, with [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=934.3800000000001s)]
*  people who are tired of having this agenda shoved down their throat? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=939.54s)]
*  Obviously it's going to be incredibly difficult. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=944.14s)]
*  Plus she was in charge of the border, claimed she wasn't. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=946.06s)]
*  Plus she was in charge of, you know, and Biden were in charge of the economy when inflation [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=948.8199999999999s)]
*  spiked. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=954.14s)]
*  Terrible candidate combined with a bad track record, combined with a flawless campaign [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=955.42s)]
*  from Trump. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=959.3s)]
*  I think easy victory. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=960.5799999999999s)]
*  And you know, if we pull up this FT chart, Nick, that I sent you ahead of time. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=962.5s)]
*  And I tweeted this, you know, Americans love winners and innovation and they hate socialism [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=970.06s)]
*  and this woke nonsense. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=973.9s)]
*  And if you look at how Trump's support increased, look at this, Chamath. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=974.9s)]
*  Every single demographic, black, Asian, Hispanic, 18 to 29, 30 to 34, female, white college men, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=980.0999999999999s)]
*  except for two, 65 year old plus, very moderately, very modestly went left. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=987.8199999999999s)]
*  White college women very modestly went left in terms of increasing support. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=994.54s)]
*  Otherwise a hard shift, right? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=999.62s)]
*  Including some categories. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1001.8199999999999s)]
*  So the biggest shift right was in Hispanic and Asian populations. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1004.18s)]
*  And these are groups of people, I think, who you can double click on young people, Hispanic [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1008.9399999999999s)]
*  and Asians. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1015.02s)]
*  Asians believe in meritocracy, I think is what most people have read into that dramatic [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1016.02s)]
*  swing. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1020.78s)]
*  Hispanics are anti, more traditional family values. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1022.14s)]
*  And that's probably what pushed that so far. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1025.86s)]
*  But I wanted to just get your take on that chart, Chamath, in relation to your handicapping [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1027.74s)]
*  of the election. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1032.86s)]
*  And then how much Kamala and how much the inflation played into it. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1034.06s)]
*  I think that there are three ways to kind of identify and tell me if you guys think [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1038.62s)]
*  these are the wrong vectors. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1043.62s)]
*  There's either the policies, the candidate and the methods of the campaign. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1044.82s)]
*  All three. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1051.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1052.7s)]
*  That's how I kind of break down what happened in this election cycle. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1053.7s)]
*  There's a big difference between the candidates as people. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1056.82s)]
*  Some people cannot see past the fact that Kamala did not get any primary vote. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1060.42s)]
*  Some people cannot see past the behavior of Donald Trump on Twitter. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1065.26s)]
*  And when he talks to people and how he has talked to people and perceived to be a bully [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1069.94s)]
*  and the felony conviction. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1074.54s)]
*  And some people cannot get past other factors of those two candidates. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1075.86s)]
*  And then some people can get past it. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1079.02s)]
*  I've been saying this since I'm doing the face, but I'll try it again. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1081.1000000000001s)]
*  I think that the mainstream media has been working hand in hand with the Democratic Party [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1086.6200000000001s)]
*  to propagate and move forward an agenda that tried to vilify Donald Trump. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1092.8600000000001s)]
*  I did not know that when I initially encountered him in 2015 as a candidate. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1099.18s)]
*  What you're supposed to do as an adult is once you start to see a pattern of behavior. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1106.62s)]
*  This is for the safety, security of your family. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1113.82s)]
*  This is about how you think about economically taking care of your family. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1116.58s)]
*  You have to re-underwrite decisions from first principles. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1120.42s)]
*  You must be prepared to change your mind when you see important information. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1122.84s)]
*  And I have said this till I blew in the face, but I'll say it again. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1128.34s)]
*  If I think of all of the people in the political infrastructure of America that I have met [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1132.6599999999999s)]
*  and spent time with, from Bill Clinton on, I remember sitting and having dinner with [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1139.6999999999998s)]
*  Barack Obama the day of Brexit and getting a note that he read and he said, oh my gosh, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1144.58s)]
*  and says, wow, the UK just pulled up. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1151.02s)]
*  I was sitting across from him that dinner. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1153.62s)]
*  I've been with all of these people. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1155.82s)]
*  The Democrats only come to me to ask me for money. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1159.62s)]
*  The only politician that has ever called me just to have a conversation, just to say thank [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1164.9399999999998s)]
*  you and be kind, the only one has been Donald Trump. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1173.26s)]
*  Isn't that incredible? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1177.86s)]
*  Of all of the people, every other person has only ever called and asked me for money. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1178.86s)]
*  So what does that mean? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1185.32s)]
*  I think what it means is that there has been a concerted effort to perturb the way that [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1186.4399999999998s)]
*  you interpret who he is. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1195.04s)]
*  Separately, there's been a concerted effort to prop up whoever is sitting against him [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1198.52s)]
*  in opposition. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1204.0s)]
*  And I think this is an opportunity to finally acknowledge that if you trust these traditional [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1206.9399999999998s)]
*  legacy sources of helping you to get to a decision, you're going to get tricked. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1212.4s)]
*  There's that old saying, you know, fool me once, shame on you, but fool me twice, shame [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1218.8000000000002s)]
*  on me because I am now allowing this to happen. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1224.68s)]
*  And I think that for a lot of Americans, that is what happened. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1229.6200000000001s)]
*  I think it is really as simple as that. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1233.0s)]
*  I think they were able to see through the veneer of an attempt to malign and corner [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1234.84s)]
*  somebody and on the other side, an attempt to basically play on vibes and feelings and [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1242.84s)]
*  emotions. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1250.6s)]
*  And I don't think that America wants that. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1251.6799999999998s)]
*  That is not what they want in running the country. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1253.62s)]
*  They want somebody serious running the country where you can have disagreements with them [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1256.56s)]
*  and you can still find an opportunity to work together with those people. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1261.68s)]
*  I think it's that. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1265.58s)]
*  Sax, do you think about how important the policy versus the individual versus the way [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1266.92s)]
*  they ran the campaign, the media and how they reach people as kind of three vectors? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1275.58s)]
*  And if so, how would you kind of rank those three in importance and what changed people's [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1281.44s)]
*  votes and got them to vote differently than they did in the last election? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1284.66s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a pretty good framework. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1287.52s)]
*  You have the message, you have the messenger and I guess you have the campaign at a tactical [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1289.52s)]
*  level. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1294.76s)]
*  I think it's a little bit unfair to blame this entire defeat on Kamala Harris being [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1295.76s)]
*  a bad messenger or candidate. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1300.72s)]
*  It's true, she's not the greatest candidate. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1303.44s)]
*  She has a lot of problems. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1305.32s)]
*  However, I don't think she was dealt a particularly strong hand. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1307.1200000000001s)]
*  The fact of the matter is that we did have rampant inflation in this country that really [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1310.96s)]
*  hurt people in their pocketbooks every time they went to the grocery store. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1317.84s)]
*  And that resulted from the trillions of spending that was agreed to by virtually the entire [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1321.9199999999998s)]
*  Democratic Party. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1326.36s)]
*  Remember, not only did they pass trillions in spending, they wanted four and a half trillion [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1327.56s)]
*  more for Build Back Better. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1332.1999999999998s)]
*  And the only reason that didn't happen is because Manchin and Sinema voted against it. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1334.04s)]
*  Can you imagine how much worse inflation would have been? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1338.8s)]
*  Manchin was driven into retirement and Sinema was basically kicked out of the party. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1342.04s)]
*  She effectively told us that at the All In Summit. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1345.52s)]
*  So this defeat is on the entire Democratic Party. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1348.36s)]
*  The Democratic Party was in support of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's agenda. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1351.48s)]
*  They were in support of the de facto open border policies. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1356.04s)]
*  They were in support of the soft on crime, Soros, DA, decarceral policies. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1359.2s)]
*  You can see that even in California, which is a deep blue state, there's a huge backlash. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1365.12s)]
*  Huge. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1369.76s)]
*  This sort of insane soft on crime agenda the Democrats have. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1371.0s)]
*  70% of California voted for Prop 36, which basically reversed the excesses of Prop 47, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1375.6s)]
*  which a decade ago basically made shoplifting legal in California. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1383.28s)]
*  You know who opposed Prop 36 despite its massive popularity? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1387.6s)]
*  Gavin Newsom. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1390.96s)]
*  Kamala Harris wouldn't say whether she supported it or not. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1391.96s)]
*  So what you see is that even in blue states, the Democratic Party elites are completely [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1394.74s)]
*  out of touch with what people want. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1399.9599999999998s)]
*  And then finally, you've got foreign policy, where I think that the Democratic agenda, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1402.2199999999998s)]
*  basically wanting to engage in a proxy war with Vladimir Putin because he's the incarnation [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1407.58s)]
*  of all evil, that I think is blown up in the collective West face. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1412.26s)]
*  That has been a disaster that was supported by the entire Democratic Party. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1416.86s)]
*  So on issue after issue that I think mattered in this election, you cannot just put the [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1421.1s)]
*  blame on Kamala Harris. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1426.12s)]
*  It's got to be on the Democratic Party as a whole. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1428.74s)]
*  And just to echo what Chema said about the cultural stuff, they've talked down to us. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1430.62s)]
*  They've lectured us. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1435.86s)]
*  They've insulted us. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1437.02s)]
*  They've censored us. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1438.4199999999998s)]
*  They've gaslit us. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1440.02s)]
*  They've tried to cancel us. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1441.22s)]
*  They tried to cancel us. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1442.22s)]
*  They tried to punish dissent with lawfare. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1443.22s)]
*  They turned Elon into an enemy, which was the single worst own goal in history. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1445.3s)]
*  Remember, this wasn't just- [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1450.1s)]
*  And Joe Rogan. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1451.62s)]
*  Don't forget, they kicked Joe Rogan out as well. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1452.62s)]
*  Bernie supporter Joe Rogan. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1455.02s)]
*  With Elon, it wasn't just disinviting him or never inviting him to the EV summit. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1456.8600000000001s)]
*  It goes all the way back to Lorena Gonzalez's tweet telling him to F off and leave the state [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1461.3400000000001s)]
*  of California. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1465.98s)]
*  So look, the Democratic Party as a whole has to own this, and they're not going to start [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1466.98s)]
*  winning elections again until they have an improvement in their agenda, not just their [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1472.3s)]
*  messenger. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1477.98s)]
*  So, Sax, is this the nature of democracy that over time, when you have a two-party [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1478.98s)]
*  system and one party veers too far to the left or one party veers too far to the right, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1485.02s)]
*  people jump ship to the other party, and ultimately they pull the policies of the party that they [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1491.02s)]
*  left back to the middle. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1496.06s)]
*  And that's the way democracy is supposed to work and has worked historically. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1498.22s)]
*  So is this the way it's supposed to go, and do we project that four years from now, the [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1501.6200000000001s)]
*  Democrats will need to be and need to adjust to the center, and we'll see less of this [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1506.82s)]
*  extremism because of the way the voting turned out this election cycle. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1511.54s)]
*  I think that's a very interesting question, is whether the Democrats have the necessary [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1515.06s)]
*  introspection to learn from this loss. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1519.78s)]
*  I would say that one of them does. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1522.1s)]
*  If you look at Matt Iglesias, who's someone I've sparred with on TwitterX, who is a Democrat [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1524.34s)]
*  partisan, he basically tweeted a list of principles that he thought the Democrat Party needed [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1530.06s)]
*  to adopt. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1534.86s)]
*  I read it and retweeted it, I said, laughing my ass off, this is a list of Republican principles. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1535.86s)]
*  It was all about opposing woke and being in favor of merit and innovation. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1540.14s)]
*  Tolerance, freedom speech. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1544.0600000000002s)]
*  I'm like, great, look, you know what? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1545.0600000000002s)]
*  If the Democratic Party wants to adopt these principles, that's a wonderful thing for the [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1546.66s)]
*  country. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1550.0200000000002s)]
*  I hope that they do it. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1551.0200000000002s)]
*  But will they do it? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1553.3000000000002s)]
*  I have my doubts. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1554.3000000000002s)]
*  You look at this tweet by Ari Fleischer, where he talks about who the Democratic Party now [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1556.1000000000001s)]
*  is. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1561.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think that this is a really important tweet because it sort of tells you, Sax, who's [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1562.1000000000001s)]
*  going to be left in the room. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1566.38s)]
*  If these are the only people left in the room, the last thing they're going to do is admit [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1568.9s)]
*  defeat. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1572.46s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1573.46s)]
*  So what you see is that the Democratic Party base is these very affluent, very overeducated, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1574.46s)]
*  very non-religious types. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1581.3400000000001s)]
*  And frankly, I wonder whether they're too out of touch to know they're out of touch. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1583.22s)]
*  They're certainly very whiny and entitled. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1587.74s)]
*  And I just don't think they're going to cede control of the party without a fight. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1589.6200000000001s)]
*  And frankly, they've disappeared so far up their own woke asses that I don't think they [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1595.14s)]
*  can find an electoral majority if they try. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1601.0200000000002s)]
*  So if these people stay in control of the party, and these are the people who you're [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1603.74s)]
*  seeing having a mental breakdown on TikTok, they're posting all the videos, they're insulting [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1607.8200000000002s)]
*  the electorate. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1612.8200000000002s)]
*  And let's face it, it's not just on TikTok, it's on the legacy media, it's on MSDNC. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1613.8600000000001s)]
*  It's basically the legacy media who are trying to diagnose a psychosis in the American electorate [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1618.94s)]
*  to explain why they were so wrong. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1625.1s)]
*  If those people stay in control, I think that the Republicans could have an electoral majority [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1627.86s)]
*  as far as the eye can see. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1632.5s)]
*  I completely agree with you. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1634.06s)]
*  And I'll go even further, which is I think that the Democrats will lose one of California [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1635.58s)]
*  or New York in the next eight years. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1641.26s)]
*  If they don't attack, right? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1643.34s)]
*  So that's the key question. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1644.98s)]
*  They're not going to attack. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1645.98s)]
*  If you think that the intelligentsia, quote unquote, the Bill Gates, Reid Hoffmans of [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1646.98s)]
*  the world that funds Dustin Moskovitz, that funds the Democratic apparatus at the highest [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1653.18s)]
*  level. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1658.8200000000002s)]
*  If they can't change, what are the odds that the state infrastructure or the local infrastructure [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1660.66s)]
*  changes? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1667.3000000000002s)]
*  I think maybe on the margins, the local infrastructure can change more quickly and adeptly because [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1668.5400000000002s)]
*  it just costs a lot less money and it's much more concentrated. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1674.26s)]
*  But I think the states are very laggard in that sense. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1678.4s)]
*  And I think that they take the table scraps of what's left over. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1681.62s)]
*  So if you have the Democrats lead, there is no chance that unless they change the planks [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1684.26s)]
*  at their platform, that the state legislatures in New York and California are going to change [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1690.4199999999998s)]
*  what they believe. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1694.62s)]
*  Nick, pull up the link I just sent. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1695.62s)]
*  So let me just underscore an important aspect for you guys on this, which is the amount [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1698.4199999999998s)]
*  that the Democrats spent in this campaign. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1701.76s)]
*  And obviously they saw a significant negative return. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1704.2199999999998s)]
*  They lost across the board, Senate majority, House majority, governorships, the White House, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1706.68s)]
*  but they spent more. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1712.6000000000001s)]
*  Here you can see the difference between the Harris campaign and the Trump campaign spending. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1713.94s)]
*  Harris campaign spent nearly $900 million, the Trump campaign, $350 million. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1718.04s)]
*  If you look at the super PACs, the super PACs spent $1.4 billion on the Dem side, roughly [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1723.72s)]
*  $400 million, $450 million on the Republican side. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1728.92s)]
*  If you scroll down in some of these key Senate races, the Dems far outspent the Republicans [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1732.92s)]
*  and still lost the Ohio Senate race. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1738.56s)]
*  Sherrod Brown, $58 million of spending. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1740.92s)]
*  Bernie Moreno, $21 million. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1743.8s)]
*  And Bernie Moreno had a resounding victory. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1745.28s)]
*  John Tester, $84 million of spending. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1746.96s)]
*  Tim Sheehy, $22 million. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1749.2s)]
*  Tim Sheehy won the election. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1750.92s)]
*  So across the board, the spending was greater. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1753.8400000000001s)]
*  The return was negative. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1757.28s)]
*  Because money cannot overcome common sense. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1758.8s)]
*  So my question again is, does this not necessitate attack to the center for the Democrats? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1761.96s)]
*  They want to see the party survive. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1768.02s)]
*  And if they're going to continue to lose like this, they will not continue to maintain the [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1770.0s)]
*  same policy agenda that got them into this position in the first place. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1773.64s)]
*  J. Cal, do you think that the Democratic Party will need to attack to the center and that [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1777.32s)]
*  they're going to start to adjust because of this? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1781.28s)]
*  They started that process. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1783.16s)]
*  They knew that going into this election and they started moving to the center. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1784.3600000000001s)]
*  I think it was laughable in some cases because you have like Kamala talking about providing [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1789.44s)]
*  sex changes for prisoners. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1794.16s)]
*  And all of those receipts came out. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1796.48s)]
*  So even as she started to try to get to the center, people didn't buy it. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1799.0800000000002s)]
*  So of course they're going to. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1803.04s)]
*  But what's very interesting about spend there and the genius of Trump is earned media. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1804.56s)]
*  What's earned media? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1809.3600000000001s)]
*  When you are trying to get hits in media, you would put them into two buckets. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1810.68s)]
*  Paid and earned. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1815.44s)]
*  What you just showed was paid. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1816.44s)]
*  And that actually went a little bit better than what, but it makes sense to figure out [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1818.84s)]
*  how somebody are in for this. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1822.08s)]
*  Everyone thinks you continue to just stay aide, giving ad money to initzitives all over [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1823.84s)]
*  the country. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1827.8s)]
*  But even though the media is most important, if you fail to keep itmmm they're going to [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1828.9199999999998s)]
*  have to pay for sure. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1831.6399999999999s)]
*  And I'm sure all of you have seen this already with 약간 grin, that there is a bunch of [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1832.8799999999999s)]
*  guys that even have this. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1836.0s)]
*  We do this every week. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1837.76s)]
*  We earned our audience. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1839.52s)]
*  We didn't pay anybody for this audience. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1840.7199999999998s)]
*  And I think that was the feeling with what Trump did. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1843.32s)]
*  And it's quickly and it really brings you back to.. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1845.9199999999998s)]
*  could not even and I think Saxon's, you know, master at [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1847.64s)]
*  setting people up here. The Democrats put up a horrible, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1852.0400000000002s)]
*  horrible candidate. And I know Saxon saying, Oh, it's not [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1856.8000000000002s)]
*  common as fault. Kabbalah could not go on Joe Rogan because they [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1859.5600000000002s)]
*  knew that it would be so embarrassing and that she would [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1864.0800000000002s)]
*  get so embarrassed that it would lose her votes. His doom loop. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1866.76s)]
*  You know, observation from I don't know, eight weeks ago, you [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1871.92s)]
*  had that sax was exactly correct. The more she spoke, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1874.68s)]
*  the more she started going down. She was leading Trump at one [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1879.0800000000002s)]
*  point on polymarket in some of these places. And she absolutely [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1882.04s)]
*  proved that she could not communicate well. And so and I [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1886.2s)]
*  just want to just circle back to the point about inflation. Here's [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1891.3600000000001s)]
*  the McDonald price increases that I was mentioning before, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1896.0800000000002s)]
*  end of 2019, goodbye a McChicken for a buck 29. And in mid 2024, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1898.8400000000001s)]
*  it was $3.89. The majority of Americans wind up going to Taco [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1904.0s)]
*  Bell McDonald's every week. Some cases multiple times a week, you [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1908.92s)]
*  cannot discount exactly how profound this cost of eating [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1913.88s)]
*  food and buying groceries had on this election. It is the number [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1920.88s)]
*  one issue. I think this election we can talk in our bubble about [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1924.68s)]
*  it. But this is what I mean. Inflation. This is what I mean by [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1928.32s)]
*  a return to normalcy. These are normal people problems. How much [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1931.56s)]
*  does it cost to put food on the table? Does it cost to drive [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1935.72s)]
*  from point A to point B? I want to send my kid to a school where [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1938.9199999999998s)]
*  they go and they learn the ABCs and the 123 is because they're [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1942.6799999999998s)]
*  going to have to graduate and compete with India and China. I [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1946.0s)]
*  don't want to worry about indoctrination and all this other [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1949.56s)]
*  stuff. Absolutely. Yeah. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1951.84s)]
*  So look, I did predict the doom loop for Kamala Harris two months [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1953.2s)]
*  ago, because she is just not good at interviews or being off [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1956.76s)]
*  the cuff or being unscripted. Not good is generous. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1960.2s)]
*  Saxton Thomas was right about that. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1963.56s)]
*  Absolutely. However, and I would say the biggest problem in her [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1965.48s)]
*  campaign is that she would neither defend the Biden Harris [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1968.88s)]
*  record, nor say what she would do differently. The question you [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1972.8400000000001s)]
*  have to ask is why. And I think it's because she was in a really [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1976.24s)]
*  tough position that her own party put her in, which is they [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1980.4s)]
*  said you can't criticize Joe Biden, because he's the sitting [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1984.16s)]
*  president. But at the same time, you can't defend him either, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1987.6s)]
*  because he's so unpopular. Well, what made him unpopular? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1992.36s)]
*  Democratic Party policies. They should have, frankly, looking [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1995.6399999999999s)]
*  back, they should have just let Joe Biden defend his own record. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=1999.04s)]
*  The old man must have been in the White House gnashing his [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2003.24s)]
*  teeth, saying, please put me in the game. Let me defend my own [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2006.3999999999999s)]
*  record. He at least believed in it. The Democrats wouldn't [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2010.4399999999998s)]
*  defend their own record because it was so bad. You have to put [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2013.9199999999998s)]
*  some blame for that, not just on combo, but on the entire party. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2017.2s)]
*  That's my well, only pox. It's so obvious that that technique [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2020.68s)]
*  they use to defeat Trump in 2020. After those chaotic four [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2024.8s)]

*  was at 15 million votes. What's that? I didn't hear the joke. I [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2031.8400000000001s)]
*  said what, what tactic was that 15 million extra votes? Oh, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2038.28s)]
*  you're pleased. I'm sorry, the conspiracy theories. Well, no, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2041.92s)]
*  we're really gonna say that this has to be a conspiracy theory [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2046.2s)]
*  now. Well, I mean, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2049.2000000000003s)]
*  who's the chart from? What's the provenance of the chart? Just [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2052.92s)]
*  say, you know, the y axis starts at 50 million. So don't be, you [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2056.2000000000003s)]
*  know, like a little too crazy. Like they mailed out. Hold on. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2059.8s)]
*  Before we go down this rabbit hole, let me just finish my [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2062.4s)]
*  point. Then you guys can go to conspiracy corner and say the [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2064.36s)]
*  election was stolen. The point I'm making here is obviously, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2066.44s)]
*  Biden ran a very successful campaign against Trump based on [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2070.76s)]
*  vibes and based on his creating chaos in the country and most [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2074.0s)]
*  people's mind in this return to normalcy. So that did work for [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2078.0s)]
*  them previously. It just didn't work this time because they had [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2081.56s)]
*  to defend their record on the border, they needed to defend [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2084.84s)]
*  their record on the economy and sex is exactly right. They [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2087.88s)]
*  didn't touch that. And how do you not talk about their own [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2090.2s)]
*  record and their record had some good bright spots to it, record [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2095.28s)]
*  low unemployment, record high stock market. And we tamed [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2099.08s)]
*  inflation, and they could have had a really great discussion [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2103.16s)]
*  about inflation and just said, Hey, listen, both of the last [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2105.7999999999997s)]
*  two terms, there was a lot of spending. And so inflation [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2109.12s)]
*  manifested during the last four years. And hey, we tamed it. So [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2111.92s)]
*  here we are, we still have record low unemployment, we [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2115.64s)]
*  still have a record high stock market, and we tamed inflation, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2118.48s)]
*  things are going to get better. But she couldn't even [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2121.7599999999998s)]
*  communicate that I can communicate that better than the [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2123.7999999999997s)]
*  presidential candidate. Come on, she could have easily done that. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2126.7999999999997s)]
*  Freebird, let me just go back to your point about the money. It [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2130.16s)]
*  is true that the Democrats had roughly three times as much [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2131.92s)]
*  money as the Republicans did. The Democrats had something [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2135.84s)]
*  like a billion dollars for this campaign, the Republicans had [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2139.04s)]
*  for the presidential campaign, for the presidential campaign, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2141.84s)]
*  exactly. The Republicans obviously still won in a [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2144.4s)]
*  landslide that excludes that excludes the super PACs, which [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2147.6800000000003s)]
*  had additional funding that we're going towards supporting [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2150.52s)]
*  the nominee. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2152.8s)]
*  Fair enough. My point is just the Democrats had a massive [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2153.2400000000002s)]
*  advantage on the money side. They also I think, had a massive [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2155.36s)]
*  advantage on what you would call the legacy media side. I [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2159.2s)]
*  mean, I don't know how you put a value a dollar value on what [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2163.68s)]
*  the legacy media has done, not just in this election cycle, but [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2167.2s)]
*  for the last eight or nine years, they have basically [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2170.6s)]
*  called Donald Trump, a Nazi, a fascist, a traitor. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2174.2s)]
*  Did it work? Or did it [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2178.8399999999997s)]
*  hold up in their face? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2180.2s)]
*  Get to that. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2181.12s)]
*  A trader in their faces. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2181.8799999999997s)]
*  They called him an agent of Putin. They called him an [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2183.3999999999996s)]
*  insurrectionist. They called him a convicted felon. They called [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2185.68s)]
*  him a dictator. They've been yelling that at the top of their [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2188.2s)]
*  lungs now for at least four years. The country didn't [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2191.08s)]
*  believe it. I would just say that the legacy media spell is [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2194.8399999999997s)]
*  broken. Their credibility has been destroyed. And I think that [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2198.0s)]
*  the repudiation of the legacy media is one of the most [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2201.8799999999997s)]
*  important results of this election. It just shows that the [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2206.2s)]
*  Democrats had, I don't know how you valued a trillion dollar [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2210.68s)]
*  propaganda machine on their side, and Trump was still able [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2213.3599999999997s)]
*  to win. And you have to, at the end of the day, say that [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2217.08s)]
*  that's a result not just of alternative media gaining steam [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2220.4s)]
*  and free speech on X. I think those were absolutely necessary [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2224.64s)]
*  enablers. It's also the fact that Trump has a trillion dollar [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2227.68s)]
*  personality, and is a tremendously gifted [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2231.52s)]
*  communicator and politician in his own unique way. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2234.16s)]
*  Genius. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2236.6s)]
*  But finally, you have to say that the issues are on Trump's [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2237.16s)]
*  side. Americans want the border to be sealed. They see that the [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2241.2s)]
*  spending and the bureaucracy in Washington are out of control. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2245.12s)]
*  They do not want woke cancel culture anymore. They see [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2248.24s)]
*  America getting over involved in foreign wars. They want the [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2252.64s)]
*  spending to be brought back home where it benefits them. These are [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2256.04s)]
*  the key points of the Trump agenda. And at the end of the [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2260.6s)]
*  day, whatever you want to say about Trump, he ran a campaign [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2263.64s)]
*  based on issues. He talked about issues. What did Kamala Harris [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2267.8399999999997s)]
*  run her campaign on? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2272.2s)]
*  Vibes. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2273.72s)]
*  Vibes. Celebrity endorsements. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2274.28s)]
*  Name calling. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2276.76s)]
*  It worked last time. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2277.1600000000003s)]
*  Debunked hoaxes. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2278.4s)]
*  I just want to go around the horn real quick and ask each of [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2279.88s)]
*  you guys once again, I'm going to ask you one more question [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2282.36s)]
*  after this. What mattered most? Was it the policy sacks as [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2284.32s)]
*  you're proclaiming is what a lot of people voted on? Was it the [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2287.8s)]
*  issues with the candidate, the individual? Or was it the media [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2290.5600000000004s)]
*  or the campaign tactics? So those three, what mattered most [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2293.48s)]
*  do you think in terms of moving votes? What moved the most? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2296.36s)]
*  Listen, I don't think you can separate the man from the [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2298.1600000000003s)]
*  message or the messenger from the message. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2300.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2302.6400000000003s)]
*  Listen, if you had a conventional Republican out [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2302.92s)]
*  there, I don't think that they could have overcome the trillion [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2307.0s)]
*  dollar propaganda machine. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2310.48s)]
*  Of the legacy media. That being said, I think if Donald Trump [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2313.0s)]
*  had been campaigning with Mitt Romney's message, or Mitch [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2316.84s)]
*  McConnell's message, I don't think he would have gone [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2321.56s)]
*  anywhere. I don't even think he would have been the Republican [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2323.88s)]
*  nominee. You have to say that Trump since 2016 has tapped into [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2325.76s)]
*  something very deep in the American electorate. And, you [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2331.56s)]
*  know, this is something we can get into. But I think that if [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2335.0s)]
*  you look back now over the last 10 years, it's clear that he's [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2337.2799999999997s)]
*  the transformational figure in American politics. It's not [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2340.6s)]
*  Barack Obama, with all due respect. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2343.84s)]
*  J. Cal your turn. The policies, the individual or the campaign [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2345.48s)]
*  tactics. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2350.72s)]
*  It's very clearly this had to do, you know, primarily with [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2351.08s)]
*  Kamala. It is the candidate and how she was selected. Yeah, I [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2355.52s)]
*  mean, obviously, if you had [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2359.2799999999997s)]
*  it's interesting for you to say that as a Dem, right? Because I [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2362.0s)]
*  think that may have chased a lot of moderate I'm not a [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2364.16s)]
*  moderate. I voted Republican one third of the time, maybe a [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2365.96s)]
*  little bit more recently, but two thirds, two thirds, you [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2370.24s)]
*  voted Dems. So you were open to that. And I'm a left leaning [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2372.16s)]
*  moderate. I mean, I've been very clear about that. My record's [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2374.92s)]
*  been very clear about that. It is clear that it was her because [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2377.56s)]
*  I will say if you had put up Friedberg, and I think it's [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2380.6s)]
*  great that you're forcing us to pick one of the three. And it's [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2383.8399999999997s)]
*  a hard thing to do. But if you had picked Dean Phillips and [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2387.3599999999997s)]
*  Shapiro, I think they would have be Trump very easily or [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2390.2s)]
*  because remember, Trump was phenomenally unpopular. And I [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2393.2799999999997s)]
*  think the big question that's going to come out of this is how [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2396.04s)]
*  did Elon do getting young men and how did Joe Rogan and [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2399.2799999999997s)]
*  podcasts like ours do at getting young men to come out of vote? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2403.4399999999996s)]
*  That's something we haven't talked about yet. And I feel [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2406.56s)]
*  like that could be the one thing that comes out of this election. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2408.68s)]
*  Over the coming years that we look at, that'll be the [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2412.68s)]
*  sustainable change is that young men are now voting, and [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2416.24s)]
*  they want to vote for something very different than white women [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2420.64s)]
*  or old people. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2424.64s)]
*  And Jamal, what is your read on what mattered most? Do you have [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2425.8799999999997s)]
*  one of those three? How would you wait? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2429.4799999999996s)]
*  If you have to write them? I think the policies of the [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2431.6s)]
*  Democratic Party are fundamentally broken. They've [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2434.6s)]
*  become the exact opposite of where they were even 20 years [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2438.7999999999997s)]
*  ago. So the Democrats used to be the protector of free speech. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2441.7999999999997s)]
*  Now they are pro censorship, the Republicans are free speech. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2446.24s)]
*  The Democrats used to be all about anti war. Now they are [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2451.24s)]
*  more likely to get mangled into all of these foreign [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2455.8399999999997s)]
*  misadventures in partnership with the military industrial [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2459.3199999999997s)]
*  complex, whereas the Republicans have been a bulwark to war. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2462.6s)]
*  And they embrace the Cheney's ultimate proof of that. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2465.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh my gosh, I mean, that was the scariest and oddest turn of [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2468.68s)]
*  events. So I think that what happened is the policies of the [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2471.68s)]
*  Democrats, they just lost their way. Now the question is, was [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2475.76s)]
*  it purposeful or was it by accident? And I think that [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2479.7200000000003s)]
*  belies the bigger question, which is just the people in [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2484.5200000000004s)]
*  charge of the Democratic Party, I think to Sax's point, do they [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2488.0s)]
*  even have a sense of that they have to change? Or are they just [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2492.7200000000003s)]
*  so now fundamentally out of touch? And they just believe [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2495.6000000000004s)]
*  what they believe so ferociously, they're going to [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2498.96s)]
*  have to go through maybe three or four or five more elections of [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2500.88s)]
*  the next election. And so they're just getting totally [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2504.76s)]
*  trounced in order to learn the lesson. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2507.88s)]
*  Okay, I'll, I'll, I'll wear my McLaughlin hat and say Chamath [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2509.36s)]
*  right answer. Now, my next, my next question back to you, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2513.76s)]
*  Chamath is I've had a lot of conversations in the last few [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2517.2400000000002s)]
*  days, with good friends, with people in close with with [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2522.1600000000003s)]
*  family and so on. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2525.88s)]
*  Hold on, Freeberg, what do you think before you ask the next [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2526.76s)]
*  question? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2529.2400000000002s)]
*  I think policy matter, but but here's the stumbling block. If [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2530.28s)]
*  that did not vote for Trump and voted for Kamala Harris, that is, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2534.12s)]
*  you know, kind of reasonable people or what, you know, I don't [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2537.44s)]
*  want to kind of classify people, but people that you would [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2541.52s)]
*  normally have decent long form conversations with, and you [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2545.08s)]
*  start talking about specific policy issues with them. The [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2548.28s)]
*  conversation keeps coming back to Trump the person, in my [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2552.32s)]
*  experience, people can't see past a person who is a quote, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2555.6s)]
*  convicted felon, as they claim, who is taking away women's [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2558.88s)]
*  rights, who is a bully, who is mean, a lot of this is influenced [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2562.12s)]
*  by his past behavior and things he said, and the way he's said [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2565.48s)]
*  things and done things on Twitter, we can we can proclaim [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2568.4s)]
*  that there was a lot of misrepresentation about Trump in [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2571.04s)]
*  the in the legacy media. But there were a lot of tweets that [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2573.24s)]
*  Trump put out that were off putting to a lot of people. So I [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2576.16s)]
*  want you Chamath to speak to the many individuals out there who [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2579.56s)]
*  are good people who feel disenfranchised, who are not like [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2583.88s)]
*  the funny people you can make fun of on Libs of TikTok or [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2587.68s)]
*  what have you, but just everyday normal people that said, I [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2590.36s)]
*  really don't trust the guy. I really don't believe that this [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2593.2000000000003s)]
*  is a good person. And I think that the policies make more [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2595.84s)]
*  sense. I agree with a lot of the policy issues. But frankly, the [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2600.2000000000003s)]
*  guy doesn't seem like the right guy for me. How do you kind of [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2603.1200000000003s)]
*  break through? Is that possible? And can you speak to that [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2605.96s)]
*  person to help them kind of see past the individual to the [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2608.2400000000002s)]
*  policies and have trust and faith that this individual can [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2612.4s)]
*  actually shepherd this nation forward? [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2615.2000000000003s)]
*  There are so many very powerful examples of how the media [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2616.76s)]
*  colluded with the Democratic Party to fundamentally lie about [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2623.2400000000002s)]
*  things that actually happened when it relates to Donald Trump. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2632.0s)]
*  One of the most simple and powerful was the lie about [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2636.8s)]
*  Charlottesville. When I processed Charlottesville, I'm [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2641.84s)]
*  probably one of those people, David, that you talk about. I [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2647.52s)]
*  was just so scared and angry. And I took at face value what the [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2651.48s)]
*  media said that Donald Trump said. And then I was really [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2660.2000000000003s)]
*  angry at Donald Trump until I saw the footage and saw that it [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2665.44s)]
*  was just a complete lie. And that is just an incredible [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2670.76s)]
*  shirking of responsibility that the media has undertaken. The [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2676.32s)]
*  deviousness, the dishonesty, it's really bad. And that's [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2680.0s)]
*  where I said I have to stop as a grown up rational man. As the [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2686.8s)]
*  head of my family, I need to re underwrite where I'm coming [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2692.6400000000003s)]
*  from. Well, head of my family with Nat when she lets me be. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2696.5600000000004s)]
*  But anyways, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2700.2799999999997s)]
*  I can feel her. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2704.12s)]
*  Keep that line in Nick. I am the head of my family. Okay, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2714.52s)]
*  anyways, guys, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2716.8799999999997s)]
*  let's get back. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2719.7599999999998s)]
*  But but the thing is, like, I started to re underwrite. And I [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2724.52s)]
*  do that every day in my day job. I'm running a company is 8090 [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2728.24s)]
*  going well or not well, it depends on the conditions on the [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2734.0s)]
*  ground. When things are going well, I need to do more of [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2737.0s)]
*  those things. When things are not going well, I need to re [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2739.52s)]
*  underwrite. Is it something that I'm in control of? Is it [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2741.7599999999998s)]
*  something that I've missed? How do I change it? How do I get my [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2745.3599999999997s)]
*  team to be better? I live it every day. In investing, it's [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2747.8399999999997s)]
*  the same thing. You know, there was periods where I was on top [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2751.08s)]
*  of the world and everything was working. Then there were waves [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2754.8799999999997s)]
*  where things were not working. But I still had to show up and [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2758.08s)]
*  do my job well. As it's turning out. In those darkest hours was [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2761.04s)]
*  when I probably have made some of my absolute best new [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2765.68s)]
*  investments. That would not have happened if I did not keep my [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2769.36s)]
*  feet on the ground and constantly re underwrite and try [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2772.88s)]
*  to challenge my biases. There are so many examples that have [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2776.7999999999997s)]
*  happened to Trump that when you actually unpack them, there was [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2780.36s)]
*  a concerted effort to lie. And that is why it's important for [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2783.88s)]
*  folks to be able to suspend that judgment. The second thing I [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2788.28s)]
*  would say is then you saw four years of the man in office. And [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2794.0s)]
*  if you actually separate the interpretation by the media, who [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2799.2400000000002s)]
*  frankly just hate him with what he actually did, you take a step [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2805.4s)]
*  back and you're like, man, these accomplishments were incredible. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2811.0s)]
*  For example, let's look at what happened with the Abraham [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2814.2400000000002s)]
*  Accords. We have never been closer to substantial and [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2817.12s)]
*  sustained peace in the Middle East. In any era of government [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2821.6400000000003s)]
*  under any president, then we were when Jared Kushner on behalf [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2825.88s)]
*  of Donald Trump negotiated those agreements. And look how far we [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2830.08s)]
*  have slipped since then. And all of that happened as a result of [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2834.84s)]
*  the incoming government wanting to undo what was so logically [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2840.92s)]
*  right in the first place. And part of that was to feed a media [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2845.6s)]
*  cycle. So again, I just go back to David, all of these normal [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2849.84s)]
*  people, and I know a lot of them as well speak to them. Yeah, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2852.56s)]
*  like, you guys need to just take a step back and take a beat. And [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2855.84s)]
*  just think about something for a second. How do so many normal, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2861.4s)]
*  high functioning, well intended people switch sides? How did [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2867.12s)]
*  that happen? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2871.4399999999996s)]
*  Now, J Cal, let me ask you, the flip side of the coin you have [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2872.12s)]
*  expressed publicly recently, even on a podcast yesterday, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2875.9599999999996s)]
*  with sacks in vigorous debate on the show many times, reservations [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2880.8399999999997s)]
*  about Trump, and the character of Trump. Yeah. How do you feel [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2885.16s)]
*  you obviously align with the policies that he's highlighted [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2890.16s)]
*  and indicated? You've said, absolutely. Yeah. Do you see [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2893.6s)]
*  past the person? Or do you still have a strong degree of [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2896.4s)]
*  reservation about the individual? And do you see that [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2899.2s)]
*  playing out in your cohort, friends, family, what have you, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2901.68s)]
*  that there's strong reservation because of the character? Yeah, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2904.96s)]
*  it's a great question. You know, I think the thing we have to do [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2908.52s)]
*  now is come together as a country. He's the president. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2911.64s)]
*  It's great that it was not a debatable election, and we're [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2914.52s)]
*  not going to have riots at the Capitol and people beating up [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2918.16s)]
*  police officers. And now it's time to actually look at what [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2921.16s)]
*  Trump said. And then we will grade him on what he actually [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2924.7999999999997s)]
*  gets done. And you know, if he is able to hang out with the [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2928.72s)]
*  cohort of Elon and Chamath and sacks, and JD Vance, I feel a lot [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2935.2s)]
*  better about it. Now there's a lot of people speculating he [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2940.8799999999997s)]
*  will turn on Chamath, he will turn on sacks, he will turn on [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2943.56s)]
*  Elon and that relationship will end in the next year or two. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2947.3599999999997s)]
*  That's what I'm looking at. Will Trump actually do the things he [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2950.4399999999996s)]
*  says he's going to do? And what did he say he was going to do? [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2954.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, he's not going to have a national abortion man. He's not [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2957.4399999999996s)]
*  going to have kick people out who get college degrees here. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2960.56s)]
*  Remember, he said on the show, he's going to staple the green [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2963.96s)]
*  card to it. And but then there's other and he said he's going to [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2965.8799999999997s)]
*  end the Ukraine, the war in Ukraine on day one. So let's make [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2968.72s)]
*  a list of all the things he promised. And like anybody else, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2973.72s)]
*  let's judge him based on what he gets done. Now, some of the [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2977.2s)]
*  things he promised, like the mass deportation of 15 million [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2980.84s)]
*  people, I think a lot of people even on this podcast, probably [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2983.96s)]
*  don't agree with I don't think anybody here wants to see 15 [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2987.7599999999998s)]
*  million people who came here to have a better life, and who are [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2991.0s)]
*  working hard and who are productive members of our [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2994.84s)]
*  society, literally get dragged out of here, the 500,000 that are [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=2997.32s)]
*  criminals or million, sure, nobody wants to see them get a [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3001.6s)]
*  free pass here. But, you know, there's going to be some of the [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3005.52s)]
*  items on his agenda, that are going to be very uncomfortable [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3009.28s)]
*  to see executed. And some of them would be amazing and [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3012.48s)]
*  miracles if he comes in. And all of a sudden, Ukraine war is [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3014.96s)]
*  settled. Fantastic. If he starts dragging a million people every, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3018.8s)]
*  you know, two or three months out of the country, that could be [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3024.88s)]
*  absolutely disastrous and incredibly hard to watch happen [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3028.2s)]
*  in America. So we got to judge him based on his actions. That's [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3032.68s)]
*  great. Let's give him the support he needs. And I really [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3035.8399999999997s)]
*  hope you know, the thing that gives me hope is the fact that [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3038.3599999999997s)]
*  sacks, Chamath, Elon, and JD Vance are by his side. So I'm [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3040.68s)]
*  going to move on to the rest of the election, the other races. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3045.08s)]
*  So the presidency, we've talked about, let's talk about the [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3048.6s)]
*  House and the Senate sacks. In the House, there's 37 races that [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3052.3199999999997s)]
*  have yet to be called, but it looks like the Republicans need [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3056.3199999999997s)]
*  about 12 more to be called to have a majority. It seems very [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3061.08s)]
*  likely, I mean, according to Polymarket, it's 99% that the [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3064.72s)]
*  Republicans will have the majority in the House. The [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3068.2s)]
*  Republicans have control of the Senate. And Trump is in the [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3070.44s)]
*  White House. What are the top policy items that the Republicans [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3074.3199999999997s)]
*  will pursue with this degree of legislative and executive [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3079.64s)]
*  control? What's number 123 on the list? What's top priority? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3084.2799999999997s)]
*  And how are they kind of getting together to figure out what and [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3087.96s)]
*  how to execute those items in the in the weeks and months after [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3091.56s)]
*  January 20? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3096.36s)]
*  Well, so first of all, I think the Senate majority matters a lot [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3098.6s)]
*  in terms of Trump getting the appointments that he wants. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3101.2000000000003s)]
*  Because if he was just at 51, let's call it, it would be quite [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3104.4s)]
*  hard. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski tend to be very, very [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3109.04s)]
*  moderate Republicans and would oppose, I think, a lot of [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3114.84s)]
*  conservative appointments. Trump's already at 53 senators, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3118.76s)]
*  and there's two more that are still up for grabs and waiting to [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3122.6400000000003s)]
*  be counted. So you might get to 54 in the next week or so. It just [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3126.04s)]
*  means he's gonna have a freer range on appointments. I think [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3129.92s)]
*  that'd be really good for Bobby Kennedy. I think it might be [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3132.1200000000003s)]
*  harder to get Bobby Kennedy confirmed for a major cabinet [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3135.8s)]
*  post with 51, with 53, 54. I think we get there. I think [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3139.8s)]
*  that's a really great thing for the country. There's other [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3143.56s)]
*  appointments in a similar vein that I think will be easier for [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3146.44s)]
*  Trump to get through. In terms of the rest of the agenda, I [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3149.64s)]
*  mean, Trump clearly does want to end the war in Ukraine. Is he [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3152.84s)]
*  gonna be able to do it on day one? No, I mean, I don't think [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3156.4s)]
*  that's realistic. Because frankly, the Ukrainians are not [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3158.6s)]
*  willing to make the concessions yet. They're not in a place [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3163.36s)]
*  where they're willing to make a deal. I still think that what [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3166.0s)]
*  Trump was saying during the campaign, if you look at it as [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3169.08s)]
*  expression of his motivations and where his sentiments are [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3171.76s)]
*  coming from, they were good sentiments. But if he can't solve [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3174.92s)]
*  it on day one, because Ukrainians don't want to make a [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3177.7200000000003s)]
*  deal, I can't really fault him for that. But I think he'll try. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3179.92s)]
*  I think that on Doge, there's clearly a strong desire of many [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3183.6400000000003s)]
*  in the Republican Party and Elon and the people that Elon brought [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3188.2400000000002s)]
*  with him for major government reform, much more efficiency, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3192.6800000000003s)]
*  much less spending. I think that we have to get as much of that [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3196.48s)]
*  past as possible in the first, certainly the first year. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3199.88s)]
*  There's a necessity for legislative action to get all [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3203.88s)]
*  the cuts in federal spending that they're looking to cut. Is [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3206.56s)]
*  that right, Sacks? So if Elon's objective is cut $2 trillion, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3209.6s)]
*  there might be some things you can just do through executive [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3212.84s)]
*  orders, and they should do as much as they can. But I think [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3215.48s)]
*  you do need some congressional action as well. This is an area [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3218.52s)]
*  where it's gonna be really hard because spending is a bipartisan [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3221.32s)]
*  problem. And it's going to be really hard to jam through the [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3224.92s)]
*  type of deep reform that we really should have at the [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3229.2s)]
*  federal level. But I think that now there's a shot because Trump [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3234.08s)]
*  does have majorities in the House and Senate, that he can at [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3237.3199999999997s)]
*  least get something through. So at least we have a shot at [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3240.48s)]
*  getting something done there. Are we gonna get $2 trillion in [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3243.3999999999996s)]
*  cuts like Elon wants? I would love that. I doubt you're gonna [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3245.72s)]
*  be able to pass that through Congress. But do you start with [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3249.64s)]
*  that number and then work your way down to a number that you [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3252.7599999999998s)]
*  can get both parties to support? Maybe that's possible, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3254.8399999999997s)]
*  hopefully. I would have started with three then. That's just my [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3258.36s)]
*  tactic. But whatever. But I think reforming the bureaucracy [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3263.5600000000004s)]
*  is just such a huge theme coming out of this election. And we [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3266.84s)]
*  just have to figure out how to get that done. We have the [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3271.4s)]
*  mandate. That's Trump's mandate. And the federal government is [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3274.8s)]
*  such a large sprawling. It is the largest organization on [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3278.0800000000004s)]
*  earth, except for maybe the CCP. And in that sense, you really [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3281.48s)]
*  have to have leverage in leadership to be able to realize [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3286.6s)]
*  that degree of action at that scale. So the cabinet positions [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3290.2s)]
*  matter a lot to realize that agenda. Is that fair to say, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3293.68s)]
*  Chamath? And maybe we can talk a little bit about who are the [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3297.08s)]
*  folks in the orbit of Donald Trump and the transition team [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3301.4s)]
*  that are being considered for different cabinet posts? And as [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3306.24s)]
*  an advisor, or as a, let's call you a theoretical advisor to the [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3310.56s)]
*  transition team? What are the kind of key posts that matter to [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3313.88s)]
*  you? How would you kind of advise them who to look for that [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3317.6s)]
*  could really realize the outcome that the mandate is dictating? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3320.28s)]
*  Well, I have no influence on this process. So I'm just [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3325.2000000000003s)]
*  totally spitballing. But right people who I think are who I [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3328.6400000000003s)]
*  think are excellent. I'm going to put Bobby Kennedy right at the [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3333.44s)]
*  top of the list. I think that Bobby has an opportunity to [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3336.7200000000003s)]
*  allow the transparency of information that will allow [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3341.7599999999998s)]
*  folks to keep doing what we've done or to change course in a [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3345.8399999999997s)]
*  way that right now, I think is a little bit more difficult than [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3351.52s)]
*  it needs to be. I think Vivek Ramaswamy is indefatigable. I [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3355.0s)]
*  think he's a you know, if you remember back to the Republican [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3361.08s)]
*  primaries, there's only one person that did not attack [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3366.3599999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump and it was Vivek. I think he believed in what [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3369.16s)]
*  Donald Trump was doing and was willing to sort of embrace and [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3373.3599999999997s)]
*  extend this idea. So I think he'd be a really good proxy. I [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3376.2799999999997s)]
*  don't know what role that looks like. But I just think that he [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3379.64s)]
*  would be [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3382.04s)]
*  it'd be amazing. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3383.56s)]
*  There's some rumors that he's going to run for governor of [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3384.48s)]
*  Ohio, but he would be amazing. The federal government, Tulsi [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3386.3999999999996s)]
*  Gabbard, we got to get Tulsi in there. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3388.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I just just to go through the list. I think Tulsi [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3390.52s)]
*  Gabbard is so awesome. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3393.7599999999998s)]
*  For what role? [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3396.48s)]
*  What would you put her in? [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3397.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, I think that rumor is is veteran affairs. Yeah, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3398.72s)]
*  veterans affairs. But you know, hopefully it's at least that. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3401.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's a cabinet position, right? Yeah. Yeah, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3405.0s)]
*  there's another race that's going on that's really below the [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3408.16s)]
*  surface, but is extremely important. And that is the new [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3410.64s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Mitch McConnell says [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3413.12s)]
*  he's stepping aside. There's two major candidates versus Mike [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3416.08s)]
*  Lee. Yeah, well, it's John Thune versus Cornyn from Texas and [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3419.2799999999997s)]
*  Mike Lee has been sort of agitating. It's not clear that [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3423.52s)]
*  Mike Lee will throw his hat in the ring. If he did, I would be [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3426.88s)]
*  all in favor of it. If Mike Lee, who is from Utah doesn't, we [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3430.04s)]
*  should really go with whoever he recommends. I really trust that [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3434.76s)]
*  Mike Lee will represent the MAGA agenda, whereas quite frankly, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3438.04s)]
*  the other candidates will be a continuation of Mitch. And this [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3442.28s)]
*  is Trump's moment to weigh in on that. He's basking in the glow [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3446.2400000000002s)]
*  right now. He is in the winner's circle. He can get anything [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3450.36s)]
*  through the Republican caucus. And I think that he could weigh [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3455.2s)]
*  in right now in the Senate Majority race and make sure the [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3459.08s)]
*  right person gets it. If you get a continuation of Mitch McConnell, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3462.2799999999997s)]
*  you will not get real reform through the Senate. Look at what [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3466.08s)]
*  happened during Trump won. Mitch McConnell was one of Trump's [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3468.64s)]
*  biggest opponents. So there would be alternatives, but I [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3471.9199999999996s)]
*  think Trump would have to step in and act. There's some talk [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3475.96s)]
*  about Rick Scott from Florida being a candidate. I think he'd [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3478.2799999999997s)]
*  be very good if he's still in the race. Or just go right over [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3481.0s)]
*  the top and go with a Mike Lee. This is your moment to basically [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3484.88s)]
*  put in a loyalist. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3488.1600000000003s)]
*  And then the big cabinet positions that are left, I think [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3490.2400000000002s)]
*  defense, probably somebody like Rick Grinnell, who's already [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3492.96s)]
*  worked for Trump and was the DNI right at the end, I think. And [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3496.04s)]
*  then in Treasury, it's, you know, I think people say it's [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3501.96s)]
*  between Scott Besant and John Paulson. I'm not so sure. I [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3504.4s)]
*  don't know. If I had governor, I think it's like probably Haskell. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3511.2000000000003s)]
*  But then, you know, I saw like, Jerome Powell, Jerome Powell this [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3513.56s)]
*  morning said he would not step aside if asked to resign by [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3516.88s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3520.12s)]
*  No, he's got two more years. So he's got until 26. He's got [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3520.96s)]
*  until mid 26. So you know, I mean, the room, I don't want to [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3523.84s)]
*  say too much. But I think this is pretty much out there. I [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3526.44s)]
*  think we're now one state not defense. I think that such a [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3528.2s)]
*  say he's gonna get it. I don't know. But that's been out there [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3531.7999999999997s)]
*  for a long time. I think that what a lot of people in let's [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3534.6s)]
*  call it the MAGA movement, the America first movement are going [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3539.24s)]
*  to be looking at very closely is do neo cons worm their way [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3541.48s)]
*  into this administration. Look at what happened during Trump [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3547.28s)]
*  one, he ran in opposition to forever wars, I think was a [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3550.48s)]
*  major part of his appeal. It's what allowed him to shatter the [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3553.72s)]
*  Bush dynasty. It's what I think really hurt Kamala in terms of [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3556.88s)]
*  having the Chinese embrace her. So it's a major part of his, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3560.44s)]
*  I'd say not just appeal, but also his legacy, that he will [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3564.92s)]
*  not continue forever wars. But the problem is that the blob [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3568.24s)]
*  keeps infiltrating the Trump administration, or they did a [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3571.9599999999996s)]
*  infiltrated Trump one by putting in john Bolton and Esper and all [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3576.2s)]
*  these guys who frankly betrayed Trump. Totally. So I think a [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3580.04s)]
*  lot of people are looking closely at will neo cons be able [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3583.2799999999997s)]
*  to worm their way into this administration. And if they do, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3586.0s)]
*  it's a very, it would be very, very sad, I think [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3588.7999999999997s)]
*  the difference this time around, which is so incredible is that [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3591.7999999999997s)]
*  you're now seeing on x people asking all the neo cons to be [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3594.32s)]
*  named and shamed, and they're creating these lists so that [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3600.7200000000003s)]
*  they can't worm their way in. It's the most incredible thing [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3603.04s)]
*  I've ever seen where have you espoused those views in the [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3606.1600000000003s)]
*  past, if so the likelihood that somebody will raise an alarm [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3609.88s)]
*  bell now on the so that you can't get near this [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3615.2000000000003s)]
*  administration. I've never seen anything like that before, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3617.6800000000003s)]
*  actually. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3620.88s)]
*  Yeah. And you know what, here's the great danger is you look at [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3621.28s)]
*  the last few months, okay, who was there for Trump, it was [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3624.24s)]
*  people like Elon, it was basically, you know, all of us [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3627.2799999999997s)]
*  who worked and look, I'm a very minor, minor figure, but I did [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3630.56s)]
*  my little part, and there were a lot of other people on the [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3635.08s)]
*  ground doing their thing. But where is he on today, you want [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3637.08s)]
*  to have to fly home for a Tesla board me, he's got real [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3639.9599999999996s)]
*  companies to run. And who all of a sudden shows up in Mar-a-Lago, [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3642.3199999999997s)]
*  the swamp creatures, they were nowhere to be found for the last [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3645.72s)]
*  three months. Now the swamp creatures come crawling out, and [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3648.52s)]
*  they're gonna be swarming Mar-a-Lago and trying to worm [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3652.12s)]
*  their way into the administration. And that's, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3654.4s)]
*  that's the issue is we got to keep, you know, this is where I [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3656.64s)]
*  hope that all the the MAGA influencers stay frosty and stay [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3660.56s)]
*  involved. We have to consolidate this victory and get reform type [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3665.6s)]
*  people in the administration, not just the usual type people [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3669.92s)]
*  from Washington. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3673.92s)]
*  Would you serve if asked? [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3674.8399999999997s)]
*  No, I mean, I've already said before, I'm the key man at craft, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3676.7999999999997s)]
*  I can't do that. But, you know, look, I would do something part [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3680.12s)]
*  time, meaning if it wasn't a full time job, if I didn't have [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3682.7999999999997s)]
*  to leave my current job, if it was just serving on some [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3685.3599999999997s)]
*  advisory committee or something that was compatible with my [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3688.88s)]
*  current job, I would do that. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3692.12s)]
*  That's a no go in. I would love to. Absolutely. Not full time, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3693.56s)]
*  because I'm running a company. But yeah, if there was the [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3697.44s)]
*  opportunity to help, basically, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3699.7999999999997s)]
*  just put me on the doge. If you wouldn't mind, I just want to go [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3701.6s)]
*  like line item by line item in one afternoon, and I'm out of [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3705.04s)]
*  there. Like, I'm just gonna go. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3707.96s)]
*  Elon did say this today. But he said the A team are running [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3709.44s)]
*  companies, we're all we're all running companies. But if asked [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3712.7200000000003s)]
*  to serve, especially in a part time capacity where you don't [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3716.36s)]
*  have to divest everything you own, and you can actually just [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3720.4s)]
*  go and call bullsh**, and actually just make sure good [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3722.64s)]
*  decisions get made, it would be an honor to serve in that [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3725.32s)]
*  capacity. I think everybody should have given a chance. I [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3728.16s)]
*  want to say one thing just to build on. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3731.52s)]
*  Yeah. And then I want to ask you one more question, Chamath. Go [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3733.2000000000003s)]
*  ahead. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3735.36s)]
*  I do want to give a shout out to Elon. And in one very specific [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3735.72s)]
*  way. You know, you've heard all these stories where he gets [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3740.7599999999998s)]
*  obsessed about something. And then he focuses on it, at the [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3744.7999999999997s)]
*  sake of everything else, and strips it down, and gets to [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3749.88s)]
*  first principles, rebuilds it back up and it works. And as far [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3754.7999999999997s)]
*  as I can tell, basically, when he decided that this election [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3759.24s)]
*  was going to come down to Pennsylvania, on one hand, and [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3762.52s)]
*  young men on the other. He just kept doing that one thing over [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3770.36s)]
*  and over and over again. Every time you turned on X, he was [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3777.88s)]
*  doing a rally. Crazy. He was speaking to the residents of [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3783.16s)]
*  Pennsylvania. And spent like two weeks there. Young disaffected [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3787.28s)]
*  voters and getting them out. And then his pack built an [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3791.2s)]
*  infrastructure that rivaled the democratic infrastructure in [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3796.3999999999996s)]
*  terms of get out the vote and transportation with a lot less [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3800.8799999999997s)]
*  money and only in a month or two. It is incredible. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3804.64s)]
*  Well, and then the sweepstakes was also a really good idea. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3809.04s)]
*  It's really, really incredible. There was a lot of controversy [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3812.68s)]
*  around the sweepstakes idea. I don't know why that was so [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3815.24s)]
*  controversial. Because if you think about the media, [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3817.4399999999996s)]
*  they're trying to make an issue that was a nothing burger a [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3821.04s)]
*  burger. Yeah. And so they, you know, I think it was dismissed on [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3823.72s)]
*  its face. Because if any person spent eight seconds understanding [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3827.44s)]
*  the law, the judge dismissed it within an hour. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3830.56s)]
*  So you know, if we look at that million dollar sweepstakes to [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3834.0s)]
*  sign up for his pack, if you think about how people normally [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3836.96s)]
*  get people to sign up, they're paying a dollar a click, probably [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3841.32s)]
*  $50 a click, whatever it is using giving money to ABC or [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3844.8s)]
*  giving money to Facebook. And he just said, Hey, I'll just do a [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3848.56s)]
*  sweepstakes sign up for this. And then I have you in the [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3850.88s)]
*  database and then I can market it to you. There's no difference [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3853.6800000000003s)]
*  between giving away a million dollar sweepstakes or buying a [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3856.92s)]

*  I'll tell you the money went to expensive consultants. They did [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3928.0s)]
*  overly elaborate staged events. They did these like fake [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3931.84s)]
*  concerts, celebrity cameo, supposedly they paid Beyonce $10 [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3934.56s)]

*  celebrities. That's true. I just read it in a tweet. So I can't [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3943.4s)]
*  say for sure. But that's what I read. Yeah, who knows? It sounds [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3946.7999999999997s)]
*  it sounds suspect. But the point is, they spent a lot of money on [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3950.08s)]
*  the consultants and, you know, the events. And Elon went after [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3955.24s)]

*  disappointment after all of this is Barack Obama. I think he, in [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3965.16s)]
*  the period when he was elected, to me was just transcended. And I [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3972.8399999999997s)]
*  thought that this is a person that really was immune to [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3978.4799999999996s)]
*  getting assimilated into the board. And I don't know why I [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3984.68s)]
*  thought that, but I did think that. And I was just so saddened [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3987.76s)]
*  to see the tone and the rhetoric from Barack Obama during this [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3993.32s)]
*  last home stretch. It, I think was reputationally very damaging [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=3997.76s)]
*  to him. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4002.6000000000004s)]
*  Where do you say that offended you? [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4003.0s)]
*  It was less about it. It didn't offend me. It was just observing [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4005.36s)]
*  or disappointing. The when the rhetoric was, you know, trying [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4008.6000000000004s)]
*  to propagate these lies, the very fine people hoax, all of [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4012.44s)]
*  these things, I just thought he's so much smarter than the [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4015.76s)]
*  abortion ban. The abortion ban. He knows that these things are [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4018.32s)]
*  not true. Why is he saying objective lies? I don't really [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4021.5200000000004s)]
*  judge politicians for doing it in general. But I never [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4026.6000000000004s)]
*  considered him a politician. I sort of considered him here, just [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4030.5200000000004s)]
*  like this echelon above. And I was really disappointed that he [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4033.0800000000004s)]
*  chose to go down that path. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4038.88s)]
*  Yeah, well, I could definitely add to that. I mean, look, I [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4040.2000000000003s)]
*  think Obama's whole mystique was that he transcended [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4042.84s)]
*  politics. And he tried to maintain that position of being [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4045.76s)]
*  above the fray, and let the grubby business of politics be [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4049.1600000000003s)]
*  beneath him. And even during the whole coup against Biden, I [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4053.0s)]
*  mean, they say that Obama signed off, he was basically in favor [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4056.8s)]
*  of the switcheroo to Harris. But he was the last person to [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4060.04s)]
*  endorse it, right? He did not want to be seen as doing the [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4063.84s)]
*  dirty work that was left to Nancy Pelosi. But there's no [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4066.0s)]
*  question that the switcheroo, I think, was was backed by Obama. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4068.64s)]
*  And then he did everything he could to prop him Harris, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4074.44s)]
*  including using the very fine people hoax telling these lies. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4076.6s)]
*  And I agree, Chamath, I think that he has diminished himself. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4079.64s)]
*  He's brought himself now down to the level of politics. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4083.7999999999997s)]
*  Down to the level of an average politician. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4086.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4088.3599999999997s)]
*  I think probably you're disappointed because you had [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4088.96s)]
*  such a high benchmark for him. But we were just talking about [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4091.0s)]
*  Trump saying he would end the war on day one. He said that [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4094.48s)]
*  he's going to deport 15 million people. And you know, all these [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4098.28s)]
*  politicians lie. So I think my closing statement on all of this [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4102.04s)]
*  is y'all were a key part in putting Trump in, obviously, and [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4107.0s)]
*  if he starts behaving in the way he behaved during his first [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4112.679999999999s)]
*  term, the darker things he did, I hope that y'all will call him [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4116.24s)]
*  on it and publicly call him on it. And that he will steer [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4120.08s)]
*  towards, you know, his better angels. And that's my hope for [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4123.04s)]
*  America. And my hope for all of you who helped put him in office [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4125.88s)]
*  and played a very significant role in getting him here when he [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4129.64s)]
*  does something crazy. If he does try to drag 15 million people [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4132.2s)]
*  out of the country. Is that okay with you, sex? [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4135.36s)]
*  Well, you said that he would start with a million people 500,000 [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4138.52s)]
*  to a million who are clear criminals. He should do that. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4141.4400000000005s)]
*  That's what JD said. We all agree. JD said that the way you [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4143.72s)]
*  report, he said that the way that you do deportations is the [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4146.84s)]
*  same way you eat an elephant, you do it one time, eat a [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4150.28s)]
*  sandwich. So the way you eat an elephant is you do one bite at [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4153.92s)]
*  a time. Let's start with the biggest criminals, the biggest [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4156.68s)]
*  people who shouldn't be here. And then let's see what happens [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4159.68s)]
*  after that. And look, if you went after the other 14 million, [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4161.4800000000005s)]
*  what would you would you be in support of that? [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4164.64s)]
*  We haven't gotten there yet. The point is, you take the first [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4166.72s)]
*  bite of the sandwich, then talk about the second bite. But there [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4168.76s)]
*  was a line from the 2016 election about Trump that I [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4171.4400000000005s)]
*  think was attributed to Peter Thiel, which is very important, [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4174.28s)]
*  which is that Trump should be taken seriously, but not [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4176.32s)]
*  literally. Sometimes when he expresses a policy or a point of [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4179.48s)]
*  view, he sells it. So when he says, I'm going to end the [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4183.96s)]
*  Ukraine war on day one, does that mean he's literally going [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4187.0s)]
*  to do it on day one? No, what it means is he's going to try [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4190.16s)]
*  really hard to end the Ukraine war. If he does it on day 365 of [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4192.48s)]
*  his presidency instead of day one, I'm not going to come out [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4197.28s)]
*  and say he lied and do what he said. No, I'm going to say he [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4199.799999999999s)]
*  got the job done. He did what he said he was going to do. So I [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4202.32s)]
*  think it's very important to judge him in that way. When he [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4205.2s)]
*  says I'm going to deport 15 million people, do I expect him [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4208.48s)]
*  to do all 15 million? Not necessarily. But if he closes the [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4211.36s)]
*  border builds the wall, seals it so it's no longer a problem, [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4215.04s)]
*  and deports 500,000 to a million hardcore criminals out of this [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4218.28s)]
*  country, I'm going to say that was a massive success. And you [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4221.639999999999s)]
*  know what's gonna happen? The legacy media is gonna say, well, [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4224.719999999999s)]
*  he lied because he didn't deport the other 14.2 million. Come on. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4226.24s)]
*  No, I'm actually just saying he does understand the difference [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4230.839999999999s)]
*  between campaigning and governing. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4233.48s)]
*  I agree with all that. And I do think if he does try to do the [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4235.24s)]
*  14 million, that's the thing I have concerns about. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4238.96s)]
*  Got it. Okay, free break over to you. So let's talk about the [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4241.16s)]
*  cabinet positions. Chamath, a guy like RFK Jr. has never held an [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4243.5199999999995s)]
*  executive position before you and others on this panel. Sax, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4247.8s)]
*  J Cal, myself, we've all kind of managed large groups of people. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4252.72s)]
*  We've all been in positions of being a CEO of a business. You [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4255.72s)]
*  talk a lot about bringing in the outsiders and the Trump campaign [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4259.36s)]
*  talks a lot about bringing these outsiders sacks begrudgingly, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4261.96s)]
*  highlights the swamp creatures emerging to ask for those slots [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4265.0s)]
*  in those positions, because they are lifelong politicians and [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4268.16s)]
*  bureaucrats. How do we have trust and faith? Or do you think [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4271.8s)]
*  that that's the whole point is that you have folks that don't [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4275.4400000000005s)]
*  have the experience to run these organizations that don't have [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4278.0s)]
*  the insights on who actually works there on how they operate. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4280.84s)]
*  And then coming in is going to provide enough of a fresh [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4283.84s)]
*  perspective, and things up enough that that's exactly the [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4285.96s)]
*  point. And like talk a little bit about bringing in outsiders, [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4289.12s)]
*  but outsiders that can be effective in transforming these [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4292.5199999999995s)]
*  government agencies, not just blowing them up, or is the goal [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4295.5599999999995s)]
*  to blow them up? [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4298.879999999999s)]
*  No, again, I would I would just temper and tone down that [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4300.679999999999s)]
*  rhetoric. Nobody's blowing up anything. But I think step one is [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4304.24s)]
*  going to be a level of transparency, so that doing the [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4308.16s)]
*  obvious becomes obvious. And I think that if you look back over [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4312.5599999999995s)]
*  40 or 50 years, what has happened is that secretaries and [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4316.639999999999s)]
*  political appointments have gone from get the best person in the [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4320.599999999999s)]
*  job because they know it to here's political payola, if you [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4324.2s)]
*  will. And I think the pendulum has swung to too far of an [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4327.839999999999s)]
*  extreme. That's why the swamp people are able to maintain [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4331.799999999999s)]
*  control, because the person above them who's appointed [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4335.44s)]
*  doesn't fundamentally know the inner workings of the [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4338.32s)]
*  organization. I suspect what you're going to see is a radical [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4340.36s)]
*  push to transparency. And I think that when you combine [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4344.719999999999s)]
*  transparency, and Sachs called for this a version of the Twitter [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4348.16s)]
*  files for the government, I do think you're going to see that. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4350.96s)]
*  But if you combine that push to transparency, with a handful of [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4354.76s)]
*  topics, you know, by the way, we introduced a long time ago, this [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4358.639999999999s)]
*  idea of zero based budgeting into the lexicon and language of [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4362.32s)]
*  these political candidates that they used all the way through to [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4365.48s)]
*  the finish line. I do believe the Republicans earnestly mean [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4367.66s)]
*  it. And so I think when you put these two things together, [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4372.32s)]
*  Friedberg, I think what you will have is all of this laid bare. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4375.24s)]
*  And then I think it'll start a debate on what to do. And I [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4380.5199999999995s)]
*  think the decisions about what to do will be so blindingly [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4382.719999999999s)]
*  obvious, the low hanging fruit will save this country once we [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4387.96s)]
*  pluck it. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4392.4s)]
*  Can I say a word about I think it's so important for Bobby [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4393.88s)]
*  Kennedy to be confirmed and whatever cabinet position that [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4397.5599999999995s)]
*  he's going to get. Number one, you know, we look back to the [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4400.0s)]
*  campaign now, and it seems obvious that Trump was going to [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4403.68s)]
*  win it. But at the time that Bobby Kennedy came on board, [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4405.96s)]
*  that was a major factor in shifting momentum towards Trump. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4408.4800000000005s)]
*  So that's number one. Number two, we need to keep Bobby [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4413.400000000001s)]
*  Kennedy's coalition as part of our movement. It's not just [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4416.64s)]
*  about what he did in this last election. It's keeping all of [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4420.56s)]
*  those people, those young people and those former Democrats on [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4423.8s)]
*  side and part of the Republican Party and the MAGA movement. And [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4427.0s)]
*  number three, he's genuinely going to reform that huge part [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4430.24s)]
*  of the bureaucracy. And that's extremely important. We need [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4434.2s)]
*  outsiders to come in and shake things up. He's right about the [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4437.28s)]
*  regulatory capture. He's right about the marriage of state [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4440.5199999999995s)]
*  power and corporate greed. Let's have someone go in there who's [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4443.76s)]
*  got fresh eyes, but also understands how the bureaucracy [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4447.8s)]
*  works because he's litigated and shake things up. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4450.36s)]
*  If you look at what Bobby posted to Instagram, Nick, I don't know [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4453.48s)]
*  if you can find it. But it was pretty telling on this [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4456.2s)]
*  dimension of the first inning is going to be about absolute [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4459.84s)]
*  radical transparency and sharing with the American people, [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4464.6s)]
*  everything that's been that's been under the covers. By the [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4468.400000000001s)]
*  way, it's not just on that dimension, right? We're going to [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4470.88s)]
*  see the Epstein files, we're going to see the Diddy lists, [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4474.6s)]
*  we're going to see the JFK file. I know that these things are [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4478.04s)]
*  sort of fringe conspiracy theory type things for some people. But [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4480.400000000001s)]
*  the point is, from pillar to post, that first phase of this [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4484.32s)]
*  radical truth seeking transparency is an incredible [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4488.36s)]
*  disinfectant that you can build from. And he told the FDA, I [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4492.36s)]
*  think something to the effect of pack your bags and keep your [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4495.8s)]
*  records. Now, let's let's take the hyperbolic part of it out. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4498.5599999999995s)]
*  But it's the keep your records part that should be valuable [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4502.599999999999s)]
*  because we deserve to have answers. Now, when you think at [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4505.04s)]
*  the same time, that you have inventions like AI that can [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4509.4s)]
*  crunch every single piece of data under the sun and tell you [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4513.32s)]
*  the absolute truth. Imagine when you put transparency, and [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4516.48s)]
*  the government sharing incredible amounts of [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4520.28s)]
*  information with the compute power that the Google's and the [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4522.839999999999s)]
*  Facebook's and the and the open eyes of the world are creating. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4525.919999999999s)]
*  You'll know these answers to all of these questions. Vaccines, [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4530.0s)]
*  are they good or bad? When how? fluoride is good or bad? When [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4533.919999999999s)]
*  how? All of these drugs that have been approved? Why? All of [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4537.679999999999s)]
*  these drugs that have not been approved? Why? You're going to [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4541.44s)]
*  start to see some really interesting things. Has there [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4543.919999999999s)]
*  been research on the impacts of food on physiology? Were they [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4546.36s)]
*  suppressed? Were they not suppressed? So I think phase one [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4549.96s)]
*  is get it all out into the open. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4552.5599999999995s)]
*  Totally. And what I what I said just what what your mouth [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4556.719999999999s)]
*  referred to is, yeah, I said, we should do a Twitter files for [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4559.599999999999s)]
*  the whole federal government. Just what I meant by that is [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4562.48s)]
*  remember, before Elon bought Twitter, they told us for years, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4565.12s)]
*  that the idea that Twitter was shadow baiting conservatives and [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4569.92s)]
*  engaging in censorship was a conspiracy theory. Then Elon [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4574.12s)]
*  opened up the Twitter files and we saw that it was all true. And [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4577.64s)]
*  moreover, that the government was engaged in censorship, they [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4581.4s)]
*  had been working hand in glove with the Trust and Safety [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4584.88s)]
*  Department. The FBI had logins, they could just go in [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4587.599999999999s)]
*  themselves. Yeah, the FBI had their own tool called teleport, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4589.84s)]
*  which would allow them to transmit secret instructions to [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4593.32s)]
*  the Trust and Safety team at Twitter and they were censoring [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4596.76s)]
*  based on those instructions. That's completely unacceptable. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4598.96s)]
*  Twitter management lied about it, the government lied about [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4602.08s)]
*  it. We only found out through the Twitter files. Let's do a [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4604.2s)]
*  Twitter files for the federal government. What do you think [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4607.16s)]
*  we're going to find out? What do you think we'd find out about [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4609.8s)]
*  COVID? What do you think really happened there? If Bobby Kennedy [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4612.36s)]
*  can do that? The lies they told us? [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4615.68s)]
*  In completeness of the actual clinical validation studies, the [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4617.96s)]
*  authorizations and the waivers that were secured. How good or [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4622.84s)]
*  how brittle or how fragile was that data? By the way, I think [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4626.76s)]
*  what we what it'll also do Freiburg is if if it looks like [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4629.92s)]
*  this data is actually an extreme high quality, you know what that [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4633.36s)]
*  does? It reestablishes trust in that institution, which is also [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4636.4400000000005s)]
*  a win. So this whole thing is a win win. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4640.96s)]
*  Well, and well, let's not forget the FOIA leader, they were [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4644.6s)]
*  literally being taught how to route around Fauci's team how to [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4648.24s)]
*  route around subpoenas and people looking for information. I [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4653.2s)]
*  mean, there's a lot to uncover here. I'm 100% here for it. Yeah. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4657.28s)]
*  So just to be clear, there's a there's a there's a law in the [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4661.24s)]
*  United States called the Freedom of Information Act. The FOIA is [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4663.759999999999s)]
*  kind of a common term. And it gives the power and authority to [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4667.36s)]
*  individual citizens and third party agencies to have a check [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4671.4s)]
*  and balance on the federal government that they can go in, [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4675.24s)]
*  they can request actual data actual files, and it is all [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4677.679999999999s)]
*  necessarily available to the public at any time, except for [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4681.5599999999995s)]
*  classified information. Okay, well, the federal government now [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4686.32s)]
*  overclassifies everything we have something like what like a [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4689.24s)]
*  billion classified documents, they literally classify [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4691.5599999999995s)]
*  everything. So through the FOIA process, third party lawyers and [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4694.08s)]
*  nonprofits have made requests to federal agencies to get access [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4698.12s)]
*  to this sort of information. And I've done it, I don't know if [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4701.5599999999995s)]
*  you guys have ever used FOIA powers for information from the [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4704.32s)]
*  federal government, I had to do FOIA requests 10 years ago to [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4707.48s)]
*  get weather data or 15 years ago, for my startup climate, it [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4710.28s)]
*  was the only way we were able to get access to a bunch of weather [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4713.96s)]
*  data was through FOIA requests. And then we're able to use the [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4715.8s)]
*  data in our services because it is public data, the taxpayers [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4718.4800000000005s)]
*  pay for it. So we had a right to it. Similarly, you can make [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4721.84s)]
*  FOIA requests of emails, and inter agency communications and [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4724.4400000000005s)]

*  about the FOIA lady, there may over time have been some degree [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4732.2s)]
*  of corruption of the FOIA process in all of these [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4735.84s)]
*  agencies, which has made it more difficult for individuals and [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4738.4800000000005s)]
*  third parties to have the appropriate checks and balances [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4742.320000000001s)]

*  months for them to respond to you. And it's become quite [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4749.919999999999s)]
*  difficult. So the FOIA, the intention of the Freedom of [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4752.4s)]

*  This will not be through FOIA. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4758.4s)]
*  They make one other suggestion is we need a massive [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4759.599999999999s)]
*  declassification effort of the federal government, maybe this [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4762.839999999999s)]
*  is the way to actually implement the Twitter files strategy is [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4766.5199999999995s)]
*  the problem is we have a massive over classification problem, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4770.28s)]

*  kind of do whatever they want and kind of work in peace [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4779.5599999999995s)]
*  without having to disclose what they're really doing. If they [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4781.679999999999s)]
*  just mark classified on a document, someone needs to go [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4784.32s)]
*  through that and start massively declassifying. If they do that, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4787.96s)]
*  then there'll be a lot more documents available to FOIA [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4791.679999999999s)]
*  requests. So that right there would be a huge help. And then [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4793.879999999999s)]
*  like you said, the FOIA process could be tightened up, it could [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4796.5599999999995s)]
*  be a lot faster, it could be a lot easier. And they should not [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4799.799999999999s)]
*  be able to circumvent it by doing the kind of stuff that [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4802.84s)]
*  J Cal referred to during COVID where they were like, [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4805.2s)]
*  deliberately misspelling words. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4809.24s)]
*  So they wouldn't show up in you know, hacker speak in order to [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4811.12s)]
*  avoid this. And they were also told a bunch of people who are in [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4814.4400000000005s)]
*  three letter agencies just by default, put this at the highest [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4819.24s)]
*  level of security, not to be dis classified, declassified. So [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4823.32s)]
*  they unnecessarily put everything classified. And so [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4827.4400000000005s)]
*  now, so it's not subject to FOIA. Every email is marked at [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4831.16s)]
*  the highest level of classification, which means [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4835.0s)]
*  there's no discerning it. And if you were to blame an FBI agent, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4837.639999999999s)]
*  if they told you, hey, just put everything on classified, so it [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4840.96s)]

*  cover your ass. And that's got to change. Yeah. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4846.32s)]
*  Well, a lot a lot to come in the weeks ahead. I'm sure we will do [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4849.12s)]

*  RFK. Do you want to see him? [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4858.52s)]
*  I have very deep trepidation about RFK having oversight. I [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4860.56s)]
*  think the authority might be limited with respect to the [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4864.200000000001s)]
*  legislative authority that's vested by the Congress, which is [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4868.360000000001s)]

*  that RFK brings up that I very, that resonates with me. I'm not [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4874.280000000001s)]
*  a black and white guy. So there are things that he says that [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4878.360000000001s)]
*  make a lot of sense. There are things I've pointed out, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4880.84s)]
*  particularly around microplastics in the environment, [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4883.320000000001s)]
*  particularly around chemistry that we use in our food, and our [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4885.6s)]
*  systems of food and production. And I believe very strongly that [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4888.04s)]
*  we have real issues that have, you know, compounding effects on [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4891.56s)]
*  our health. So let me not be be too flippant about that. I am [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4895.4s)]
*  not a all vaccines are always good all the time person. I [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4899.5199999999995s)]
*  think that every one of them needs to be studied on the [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4902.88s)]
*  merits and the risks. I think fluoride is an interesting [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4904.5199999999995s)]
*  conversation to have. What are the merits? What are the risks? [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4907.28s)]
*  And why is it a federal? Why is there a federal authority over [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4909.84s)]
*  fluoride and water, which by the way, there isn't it's all local [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4913.6s)]
*  municipalities get to decide. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4916.0s)]
*  On a nuanced basis, then net net, where do you wind up free [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4917.24s)]
*  birth net net? Where do you wind up? [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4920.16s)]
*  I will say that there are a number of things that RFK have [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4921.44s)]
*  said that that caused me a lot of trouble that I'm very troubled [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4923.28s)]
*  by. Because I think that he has said things that are factually [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4925.96s)]
*  wrong. And I want him to be open to debate and open to review of [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4929.0s)]
*  objective truth. And that's it. And that's it. And as long as [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4933.4s)]
*  net net, do you like him as a disinfectant as a rabble rouser [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4936.16s)]
*  as to shake up the system or net net? Do you think it's too [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4941.28s)]
*  risky to let him in? [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4943.84s)]
*  Generally, I think all these systems should be challenged 100% [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4944.88s)]
*  so net net, you want to send them in, [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4947.84s)]
*  you say you want him to be open to debate. I personally never [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4949.4800000000005s)]

*  debate interviews than Bobby Kennedy's done everything he's [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4956.72s)]
*  been on the show twice. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4959.24s)]
*  I'm not classifying him otherwise. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4960.24s)]
*  I'm not classifying him otherwise. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4961.8s)]
*  You know, who is not open to debate and discourse and [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4962.92s)]
*  transparency is a bureaucracy. That's the problem. If you want [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4965.64s)]
*  government reform, you have to get into the bureaucracy, you [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4969.84s)]
*  need outsiders to come in, you make it transparent, you got to [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4972.6s)]
*  declassify. That's what you got to do. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4976.4400000000005s)]
*  One of the most important aspects of science, not the [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4979.6s)]
*  recently legacy media or jokingly definition of quote, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4982.4800000000005s)]
*  quote, science. But science is meant to be a process of [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4986.280000000001s)]
*  skepticism, interrogation and the search for objective truth, [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4989.08s)]
*  which means that you should be constantly questioning whether [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4992.72s)]
*  you are right or wrong. And I do think that that is a necessary [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4995.4800000000005s)]
*  part of the process of science. Science is not meant to be a [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=4998.84s)]
*  dictatorial regime. And so I think that resetting the [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5001.96s)]
*  framework for how we operate some of the agencies and [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5005.4s)]
*  authorities that are supposed to be rooted in science to have [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5009.16s)]
*  the necessary process of skepticism, review and [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5012.32s)]
*  transparency into that, I think will reassert faith and reassert [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5016.16s)]
*  trust by the public in how these agencies are operating. And I [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5021.12s)]
*  hope that that happens. I really do, because I do think that [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5024.28s)]
*  there are very good people in all these agencies who do very [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5027.0s)]
*  good work. And there's a lot of very important advances that [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5029.48s)]
*  have come out of the United States of America, and have gone [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5032.24s)]
*  through processes through the federal government that have [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5034.879999999999s)]
*  actually done really great things for Americans and for [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5037.2s)]
*  humanity. And so I don't want us to dismiss things as being [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5039.599999999999s)]
*  whimsical bureaucracies that don't have any rooting in [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5042.599999999999s)]
*  science. But I do think that it's important to have this [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5045.12s)]
*  degree of skepticism and process and have transparency. So [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5047.12s)]
*  that's all. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5049.879999999999s)]
*  Well, I'd like you to show me in the Constitution, where the [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5050.759999999999s)]
*  bureaucracy or the administrative state is a branch [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5055.4s)]
*  of the government. I see in the Constitution that we are supposed [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5058.08s)]
*  to be ruled by an executive branch, a legislative branch, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5061.72s)]
*  and a judicial branch. I do not see an administrative branch [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5065.2s)]
*  that has sprung into existence over the last several decades. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5069.5199999999995s)]
*  Yep. And it rules us there's roughly 3 million people who [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5073.88s)]
*  work for the federal government of those the president basically [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5077.8s)]
*  appoints 3000 and it takes forever to get them through. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5080.48s)]
*  Yeah, so we have roughly 3 million people who don't report [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5083.68s)]
*  to anyone. Nominally, they're supposed to report to the [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5087.08s)]
*  executive branch, but the president can't fire him. We [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5089.5599999999995s)]
*  talked about on the previous show, if Elon had gone into [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5092.84s)]
*  Twitter, and he hadn't been allowed to fire anyone, do you [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5095.4s)]
*  think he could have restored free speech to Twitter? Of [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5098.48s)]
*  course not. They just would have kept doing whatever they wanted [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5101.44s)]
*  to do. And that is the big problem in the federal [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5103.92s)]
*  government right now is we are ruled by a fourth branch of [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5105.96s)]
*  government that is not in the Constitution that doesn't report [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5109.08s)]

*  out, and we can't fire them. And they have been in the [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5116.24s)]
*  forefront of trying to stop Trump and the larger reform [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5119.08s)]

*  2016. Remember, it was members of the administrative state, [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5126.08s)]
*  specifically the security state who said, don't worry, we're [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5129.679999999999s)]
*  going to be the insurance policy against Trump. And they have [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5132.12s)]
*  done everything possible through the Russiagate hoax, through [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5135.0s)]
*  lawfare, through the whole Steele dossier hoax, to [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5137.88s)]
*  basically try and stop Trump and the reform movement that he [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5141.36s)]
*  represents. And the big question of Trump's second term [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5145.36s)]
*  will be whether he can finally subdue this bureaucracy and [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5147.92s)]
*  bring it under democratic control, under the control of [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5151.719999999999s)]
*  the executive branch, as the American people want. And as I [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5154.5199999999995s)]
*  think the Constitution intended, right now we are run by an [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5157.599999999999s)]
*  unelected branch of government that has to stop. And what Trump [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5160.719999999999s)]
*  represents is not dictatorship, but democracy, the triumph of [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5163.5199999999995s)]
*  democracy over this bureaucracy. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5167.28s)]
*  And a big important moment for this movement, this return to [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5169.599999999999s)]
*  the fundamentals of what was vested in the Constitution is [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5177.679999999999s)]
*  the Chevron Doctrine case at the Supreme Court earlier this year. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5182.24s)]
*  It reversed the authority for agencies to create their own [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5185.919999999999s)]
*  rules and regulations that they can then enforce on private [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5190.08s)]
*  enterprise. And if that case carries through and is allowed [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5192.759999999999s)]
*  to be used to support the efforts to deregulate or to [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5197.68s)]
*  de-agency what you call it kind of the bureaucracy, I think it [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5202.240000000001s)]
*  enables a lot of the change that folks are looking for. Why [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5205.88s)]
*  should, for example, some commission be sprung out of, you [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5209.4800000000005s)]
*  know, some assembly being created, and then that [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5213.320000000001s)]
*  commission gets to create their own rules and their own [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5215.4800000000005s)]
*  regulations that effectively are law that prevent private [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5217.56s)]
*  citizens and enterprises from being able to operate and make [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5220.76s)]
*  decisions. And I think that was a very important moment for this [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5223.72s)]
*  movement was the Supreme Court case on the Chevron Doctrine [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5227.48s)]
*  earlier this year. I don't know if you agree with me on this [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5230.44s)]
*  side, but it seems like it's gonna be. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5231.719999999999s)]
*  I totally agree. I think that was an absolute precursor, which [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5232.5199999999995s)]
*  is it was insane. I mean, again, you had a Supreme Court ruling [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5235.839999999999s)]
*  that effectively made the administrative state the highest [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5239.959999999999s)]
*  law on the land, even though there's no constitutional basis [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5242.48s)]
*  for it. So yeah, repealing Chevron was definitely half of [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5245.759999999999s)]
*  it. And I think the other half of it is going to be whether [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5248.759999999999s)]
*  lawmakers have to pass laws, you can't have individual [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5251.36s)]
*  commissions pass laws. That's that's the whole point. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5254.04s)]
*  We need bills passed by the Republican Congress that Trump [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5256.28s)]
*  can sign, but we also need, I think, cabinet level [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5259.8s)]
*  appointments, who will start to subdue the bureaucracy, bring [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5263.719999999999s)]
*  them under control, find out what they're doing, just give us [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5266.719999999999s)]
*  transparency around what they're doing, put a file this thing so [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5269.04s)]
*  then we can reform it. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5273.28s)]
*  I think that we're going to look back on this era. And I think [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5274.88s)]
*  it's going to last about 20 years or so, at least, which I [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5277.84s)]
*  call a return to originalism. We are returning to the founding [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5282.08s)]
*  principles of this startup called America. And I think it's [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5287.6s)]
*  incredible. I think Sachs is right, there's this unbelievable [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5292.0s)]
*  living document that created this incredible experiment, we [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5296.8s)]
*  veered way far away from it. It's taken us a lot of courage [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5301.08s)]
*  to get back to that place where now you can actually let that [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5308.32s)]
*  guiding document govern a highly meritocratic country. So it's [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5312.68s)]
*  going to be a lot of hard work. But my gosh, it's just an [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5318.88s)]
*  incredible moment and opportunity. Everybody should [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5321.16s)]
*  just take a breath and remember that. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5324.6s)]
*  I'd just like to do a quick survey of some of the local and [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5327.2s)]
*  state elections and get some reactions. I was going to try [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5329.84s)]
*  and talk a little bit about what's going on in San Francisco [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5332.56s)]
*  and California, I'll just hit on it. Our friend, my friend [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5334.56s)]
*  Daniel Lurie was it looks like he's going to be the mayor of [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5338.080000000001s)]
*  San Francisco, beating out the incumbent mayor London breed. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5340.56s)]
*  Daniel ran on a moderate platform and has an intention of [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5345.240000000001s)]
*  fixing a lot of the operations and inefficiencies in the San [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5351.96s)]
*  Francisco government, which has seen a ballooning in budget, San [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5355.160000000001s)]
*  Francisco has the highest budget per capita of any city in the [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5358.280000000001s)]
*  United States, I think 50% higher than New York, with a [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5360.52s)]
*  lower functioning kind of set of municipal services. And there's [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5363.76s)]
*  a lot of opportunity for improvement there. This is the [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5368.2s)]
*  first time, really important stat, first time an outsider has [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5370.04s)]
*  been elected mayor in San Francisco since 1911. Every mayor [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5373.56s)]
*  elected since 1911 in San Francisco was an existing [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5377.64s)]
*  government employee or government civil servant. So [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5382.84s)]
*  just like what we saw in the federal elections, we are seeing [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5385.88s)]
*  an outsider being placed in office in San Francisco. I [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5388.24s)]
*  wished I wished I wished Lurie a hearty congratulations, Nick, [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5391.12s)]
*  can you show them the tree? [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5394.84s)]
*  I said he has become a dangerous, dirty dumpster fire [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5397.08s)]
*  for bad ideas from libs. I hope you do the obvious and be on the [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5399.64s)]
*  side of cops justice, clean streets and meritocracy. That's [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5402.5599999999995s)]
*  your message to the incoming [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5405.36s)]
*  well. Yeah, I mean, he is has been a major proponent. You were [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5406.8s)]
*  gonna run for mayor one once J. Cal. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5412.0s)]
*  I was lobbied. I was approached and I was given a lot of support [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5414.599999999999s)]
*  seven figures of support to go do it. It's a very hard job [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5421.12s)]
*  because the supervisors actually run the city and a lot of the [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5425.84s)]
*  supervisors like they got booted to know they got booted Dean [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5429.48s)]
*  Preston got booted, Dopey Dean and Dopey Dean. So the Board of [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5434.32s)]
*  Supervisors has also shifted moderate, the mayor is now going [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5440.16s)]
*  to be a moderate outsider. And there's a real opportunity to [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5443.8s)]
*  rebuild and reform San Francisco. It's a place that [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5446.68s)]
*  I've called home for 25 years. It's a place where I operate my [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5448.92s)]
*  business. And it feels like a lot of the citizens of what has [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5451.92s)]
*  historically been you don't have to you. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5455.4800000000005s)]
*  I still live there. Hold on. I still I still live there. And I [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5457.56s)]
*  do think that it was a big election terms of improving [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5461.16s)]
*  things in San Francisco. So grass to Daniel or he's a friend [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5463.64s)]
*  of mine as well. You go down to LA another big race we booted [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5466.76s)]
*  gas cone who was the Soros DA who ruined San Francisco and [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5471.16s)]
*  failed his way up to LA was ruining LA and Nathan Hockman, [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5475.2s)]
*  who's a moderate beat him by something like 20 points. And [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5479.12s)]
*  then like I mentioned, we got prop 36 passed in California by [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5483.48s)]
*  about 70%, which reversed some of the excesses of prop 47, [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5487.36s)]
*  which is the was the proposition a decade ago that was passed by [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5491.08s)]
*  then Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom and then Attorney General [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5496.08s)]
*  Kamala Harris to de facto legalize shoplifting. So the [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5499.24s)]
*  people of California have had enough of these policies that [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5504.88s)]
*  frankly enable crime, enable homelessness, enable drug use. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5508.6s)]
*  And they want a correction. Look, even woke's and blue state [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5512.76s)]
*  liberals don't want their cars broken into. I mean, it's [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5517.4400000000005s)]
*  really shocking. It's really simple. And I mean, the crazy [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5520.76s)]
*  thing in Los Angeles with gas cone was the number of people [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5524.04s)]
*  who I know live there now know people in Santa Monica in [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5527.64s)]
*  Brentwood in Bel Air where we lived for so many years, sax, [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5530.64s)]
*  have home invasions have started again. I mean, fact is [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5535.400000000001s)]
*  like a breaking point. It's scary to have your broken into [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5538.96s)]
*  by a gang. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5543.04s)]
*  Right. And you know, one one final point on this is that [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5543.96s)]
*  while the people of California resoundingly began over 70% [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5548.92s)]
*  supported prop 36, there was one prominent figure who was opposed [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5553.4400000000005s)]
*  to it, which was Gavin Newsom, he said, when he saw early [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5556.88s)]
*  polling, I don't know what state I'm living in. So, you know, [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5559.68s)]
*  look, the state we're living in, Gavin is the one that you [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5563.32s)]
*  created. You're the one who gave us these policies. You're the [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5566.36s)]
*  one who gave us prop 47. You're the one who gave us zero bail. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5569.08s)]
*  You're the one who allowed the Democratic Party in California [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5572.08s)]
*  to be taken over by Soros DAs. You've never resisted these [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5575.08s)]

*  We have an education system that is failing millions of kids. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5656.76s)]
*  What is going on here? [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5660.28s)]
*  We have taxes that are through the roof. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5662.4s)]
*  And when you spend more and more and more to get less and less [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5664.92s)]
*  and less, and it takes more and more out of everybody's pocket. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5669.8s)]
*  What is the answer? [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5673.24s)]
*  The answer is you have to fundamentally change everything [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5674.08s)]
*  that's happening from first principles. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5676.679999999999s)]
*  Well, I will say one more point about I will call it balance in [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5678.5199999999995s)]
*  the force. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5683.48s)]
*  When a party is captured and moves too far in one direction, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5685.28s)]
*  people leave the party and they vote for the other party. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5690.16s)]
*  And then in order to attract people back to the party, they [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5693.08s)]
*  tack to the center. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5697.16s)]
*  My big prediction over the next few years is you will see a more [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5698.76s)]
*  centrist Democratic party as they try and attract their two [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5702.0s)]
*  back. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5706.56s)]
*  I'll take the other side. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5706.76s)]
*  So one more topic before we wrap. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5707.56s)]
*  I'll see Sax in Sacramento. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5709.52s)]
*  See Sax in Sacramento. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5710.84s)]
*  Not going to happen. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5712.080000000001s)]
*  Guys, before we wrap, there's one other topic that came up in [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5713.080000000001s)]
*  every conversation I had with everyone about Trump that was a [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5716.52s)]
*  female, which was abortion. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5719.64s)]
*  And look, I don't want to rehash again that it was misrepresented [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5721.96s)]
*  what Trump's position is, but abortion has become a very [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5725.52s)]
*  sensitive topic. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5728.839999999999s)]
*  A woman's right to do what she wants to do with her body when [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5729.36s)]
*  she wants to do it is something that most women feel they are [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5733.12s)]
*  very deeply endowed with. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5737.32s)]
*  And that should be an unalienable right, particularly [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5738.5599999999995s)]
*  in the United States of America. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5741.96s)]
*  And that even sending this back to states and states voting on [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5743.719999999999s)]
*  it creates a significant emotional response that drives [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5746.24s)]
*  folks to one party or the other. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5749.879999999999s)]
*  In Florida, voters rejected an abortion extension to 2016. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5751.4s)]
*  Voters rejected an abortion extension to 24 weeks. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5755.76s)]
*  Florida previously had a 15 week abortion ban, but the current [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5759.400000000001s)]
*  six week ban took effect in May. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5762.76s)]
*  So the amendment that was being proposed on the ballot this week [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5765.160000000001s)]
*  would have codified abortion procedures up to 24 weeks in the [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5768.84s)]
*  state constitution, but it needed 60% of the votes to pass. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5772.4800000000005s)]
*  But it only got 57%. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5776.320000000001s)]
*  So it looks like a loss for a pro-choice advocate. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5778.64s)]
*  Sax, what is going to happen now that these abortion laws are [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5782.679999999999s)]
*  being voted on, these amendments to state constitutions are being [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5786.2s)]
*  voted on, how is this going to reshape American politics and [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5788.679999999999s)]
*  how are the parties going to shift in the years ahead, given [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5792.759999999999s)]
*  how important and how sensitive this topic has become after the [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5795.719999999999s)]
*  decision of the Supreme Court recently? [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5800.5599999999995s)]
*  Look, I think that what you're seeing in the last election that [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5802.12s)]
*  we just had is the beginning of the end of the salience of this [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5806.16s)]
*  issue. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5809.759999999999s)]
*  I mean, abortion has been an issue that has deeply fragmented [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5810.04s)]
*  America for 50 years. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5813.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, the pro-choice versus pro-life movements have been a [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5814.8s)]
*  staple of American politics talking past each other. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5818.4s)]
*  They were never able to get to any sort of compromise. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5821.36s)]
*  With the repeal of Roe v. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5823.88s)]
*  Wade, with the DAP's decision, the issue has now been thrown [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5825.28s)]
*  back to the states and every state is working it out for [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5827.48s)]
*  themselves. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5830.08s)]
*  And in most states, what's happening is it's either the [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5831.0s)]
*  pro-choice totally wins or they compromise on some number of [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5834.48s)]
*  weeks. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5838.04s)]
*  I think that in Florida, going for 24 weeks might have been a [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5838.879999999999s)]
*  little bit too many. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5841.44s)]
*  If they had tried to go back to 15, they probably could have [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5842.32s)]
*  gotten there. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5845.04s)]
*  They probably could have gotten from 57 to 60. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5845.4s)]
*  But that's what the debate's going to be about now is just [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5848.16s)]
*  basically in red states, it's just going to be about agreeing [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5850.719999999999s)]
*  on a certain number of weeks. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5853.04s)]
*  Blue states are pretty much going to be pro-choice. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5854.32s)]
*  And you can see that the federal level, no one wants to touch this [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5857.32s)]
*  anymore. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5859.919999999999s)]
*  J. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5860.719999999999s)]
*  Cal, you raised the point during the election cycle, during the [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5860.879999999999s)]
*  campaign, that DAP's would be crushing for Trump and that women [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5863.599999999999s)]
*  were going to turn out in droves for Harris on the base of this [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5867.36s)]
*  issue. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5871.16s)]
*  That simply did not happen. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5871.679999999999s)]
*  If you look at voter turnout, Trump increased his share of the [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5873.5199999999995s)]
*  women's vote. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5877.48s)]
*  He did lose college educated women. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5878.24s)]
*  So that subset of call it more progressive. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5879.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5882.679999999999s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5883.08s)]
*  College educated women too, I think came out. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5883.5199999999995s)]
*  But if you look at women as a whole, he won more of their [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5886.24s)]
*  votes. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5888.759999999999s)]
*  So how did Trump inoculate himself on this issue? [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5889.08s)]
*  He made it really clear. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5891.92s)]
*  He was not in favor of a national ban. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5893.08s)]
*  He said that he favored the exceptions and that it was now up [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5895.36s)]
*  to the states. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5898.68s)]
*  He basically assured the country, the women of the country that [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5899.32s)]
*  again, that abortion would not be banned. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5903.32s)]
*  And that was now a local issue. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5905.04s)]
*  And I think the voters of the country, including women accepted [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5906.88s)]
*  that and it is now a state issue. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5909.56s)]
*  So Maryland, Missouri, I think it's gone. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5911.4s)]
*  Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, Montana, Colorado, Arizona, all [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5914.28s)]
*  voted to codify the right to abortion and remove abortion bans. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5918.4s)]
*  On the other hand, Nebraska voted for a ban on abortions after the [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5922.12s)]
*  first trimester and South Dakota voted against a right to [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5925.0s)]

*  So South Dakota prohibits all abortions except when necessary [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5929.64s)]
*  to save the ones. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5933.28s)]
*  Listen, even in deep red states like Ohio, the pro-choice forces [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5934.32s)]
*  have won these referenda. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5939.04s)]
*  It's just a handful of cases, like a very small number where [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5941.16s)]
*  the pro-life have gotten their way. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5944.92s)]

*  issue in American politics. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5950.44s)]
*  I think Trump has ended it as a federal issue and it's now going [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5951.72s)]
*  state by state. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5955.8s)]
*  And in most of those states, the pro-choice forces are winning. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5956.92s)]
*  I think this issue is over and I think it's over because [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5959.4400000000005s)]
*  Republicans know not to touch this. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5962.0s)]
*  J. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5964.56s)]

*  several times in the past. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5967.72s)]
*  You said women were going to vote in droves for Kamala because of [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5968.92s)]
*  the perception that Trump was trying to pass a federal abortion [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5971.360000000001s)]
*  ban. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5974.4800000000005s)]
*  I think a lot of them did, clearly, but not enough to swing the [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5974.72s)]
*  election. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5977.76s)]
*  And, you know, it's going to be... [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5978.4800000000005s)]
*  And do you think it's going to be... [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5981.08s)]
*  I mean, to the question, is Sachs right? [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5981.8s)]
*  Is this going to stop being an issue and it's now codified in [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5983.84s)]
*  state law? [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5987.2s)]
*  Or is this going to continue to be a lynch ban in American law? [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5987.8s)]
*  There will be states where women will not be able to get an [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5991.44s)]
*  abortion, sadly. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5992.24s)]
*  They will not be able to make that decision for themselves. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5993.4s)]
*  That's my personal belief. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5995.76s)]
*  They should be able to make the decision for themselves. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5996.64s)]
*  I'd like to stay out of it. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=5998.32s)]
*  But Sachs is largely right that if you don't, if I'm reading [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=6000.08s)]
*  it correctly, think about it, if you're a state and you ban [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=6004.08s)]
*  abortion, who's going to want to live there? [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=6006.88s)]
*  You're going to have a lot of people leaving. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=6009.16s)]
*  And that's been an issue here in Texas. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=6010.68s)]
*  A lot of companies are having a hard time with not only getting [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=6012.400000000001s)]

*  men are, well, are not, are citing it as a concern. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=6019.76s)]
*  So it's going to make it really untenable for an economy in the [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=6023.320000000001s)]

*  abortions? [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=6030.88s)]
*  I have heard many stories about people not wanting to come work [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=6032.280000000001s)]
*  at companies in Texas because of this law. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=6035.320000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=6038.04s)]
*  I have heard that from employers. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=6039.12s)]
*  I'm not talking about any of the ones companies that don't speak [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=6040.36s)]
*  for him, obviously. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=6042.679999999999s)]
*  But this has been an issue for companies in Texas. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=6044.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=6047.5599999999995s)]
*  Guys, this has been a fantastic follow-up to this week's election. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=6049.32s)]
*  I know some people are bitterly disappointed, frustrated, angry and [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=6052.88s)]
*  sad about the future of America and others are deeply optimistic and [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=6056.48s)]
*  excited. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=6060.28s)]

*  It's going to be, and I really do hope that everyone can kind of have [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=6063.679999999999s)]

*  I think you guys had a very influential role in moving people for the [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH76q6yYVlk&t=6082.0s)]
