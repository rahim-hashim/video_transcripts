# E142 Rich Men North of Richmond hits #1, upward mobility, real estate capital crunch, Trump RICO
**All In Podcast:** [August 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU)
*  Oh my god, Saks looks like I got hit by a Mack truck. You okay little fella? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=0.0s)]
*  How long were you out last night, Saks? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4.4s)]
*  Did you see this message? I got the text messages. I was like what the fuck is going on over there? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  I gotta get back to the United States. Time stamp. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=12.44s)]
*  1.39 a.m. Pacific. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=15.76s)]
*  I'm still out drinking tonight. There's no way I'm making 9 a.m. I'll do 10 a.m. To noon. This is Saks. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=18.16s)]
*  The negotiation has begun. And I'm waking up. It's my last day on the boat. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=24.48s)]
*  I'm trying to get off the boat in a reasonable manner and that's the first text message I get. That's the first text. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=28.98s)]
*  Ben, six minutes later. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=33.5s)]
*  Drake just came in. Better make it 11. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=35.5s)]
*  11. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=37.5s)]
*  Do you want to tell you the story? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=55.86s)]
*  So the thing I would compare it to is, do you remember that episode of Seinfeld where [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=57.58s)]
*  Costanza [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=61.86000000000001s)]
*  stumbles onto the model bar. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=63.14s)]
*  You know, he finds the place that all the supermodels are hanging out and he calls it Shangri-La because it's like this mythical place. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=65.98s)]
*  And he spends the rest of his life trying to find Shangri-La again, but he can never find it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=72.66s)]
*  Yes, that was you last night in LA. Well, so we were just out having a few drinks at this private club that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=76.42s)]
*  knew in town. It's just me and you know, my whack-pack and the room is it's just you know, a few of us having drinks. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=83.74000000000001s)]
*  Sorry, who is your whack-pack? We can bleep out these names. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=90.10000000000001s)]
*  How many of the whack-pack are on salary versus? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  He's like an NBA player. He rolls it with six people. What percentage do you pay? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=96.10000000000001s)]
*  And what percentage are your friends? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=102.10000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=104.10000000000001s)]
*  He's doing a calculation. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=106.1s)]
*  I guess about half receive some sort of monetary payment from me. Not all of them are direct employees. Some are vendors. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=108.1s)]
*  Some are vendors. Okay, got it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=114.1s)]
*  Lawyer, accountant. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=116.1s)]
*  Of course, real estate brokers, like Blackwater. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=118.14s)]
*  You don't have to have them on payroll. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=122.14s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=124.14s)]
*  So yeah, they're fee based. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=126.14s)]
*  You could call it an entourage. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=128.14s)]
*  How many rolling your entourage? How many are there? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=130.14s)]
*  Five? Four? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=132.14s)]
*  I'm going to say six. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=134.14s)]
*  I think we had about five people out. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=136.14s)]
*  Okay, that's an entourage. That's perfect. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=138.14s)]
*  Because that you can get into the club with that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=140.14s)]
*  It's more like a private club. It's not like a different kind of club. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=142.14s)]
*  Yeah, you're a member of this club. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=144.14s)]
*  Got it. Okay. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=146.17999999999998s)]
*  So we're just hanging out there having drinks and the room is empty. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=148.17999999999998s)]
*  It's just us. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=150.17999999999998s)]
*  And all of a sudden there's a subtle vibe change that happens. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=152.17999999999998s)]
*  And we look around, like five minutes later the whole place is full. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=156.17999999999998s)]
*  And it's like Shangri-La basically. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=160.17999999999998s)]
*  And we're like, what just happened? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=162.17999999999998s)]
*  What happened? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=164.17999999999998s)]
*  And then Drake walks in. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=166.17999999999998s)]
*  And we're like, oh, okay. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=168.17999999999998s)]
*  He performed at a concert in LA that night. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=170.17999999999998s)]
*  So the after party was basically at this place. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=172.17999999999998s)]
*  So it's not like we were hanging out with him. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=174.22s)]
*  What were you drinking? Are you on the tequila still? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=176.22s)]
*  Or what are you on right now? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=178.22s)]
*  You seem to love that tequila. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=180.22s)]
*  Are you on the ranch water still? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=182.22s)]
*  Yeah, I used to like bourbon or scotch. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=184.22s)]
*  But now these sort of highly refined tequilas are better. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=186.22s)]
*  So the Claussosul is probably my favorite. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=190.22s)]
*  Claussosul Reposado. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=192.22s)]
*  These Reposados are on Yeho's are really great. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=194.22s)]
*  And I've advocated to this group that we should actually have our own [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=197.22s)]
*  all in tequila label. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=201.22s)]
*  I'm in. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=203.26s)]
*  So we'll see if the fans like that idea, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=204.26s)]
*  let us know in the comments and we'll work on it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=206.26s)]
*  But now how do you drink it? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=208.26s)]
*  Are you a neat guy? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=210.26s)]
*  You put a couple of ice cubes in? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=211.26s)]
*  Or do you do like a Bill Gurley ranch water situation? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=213.26s)]
*  What's the ranch water? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=215.26s)]
*  Ranch water is you take a Topa Chica, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=217.26s)]
*  some tequila, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=219.26s)]
*  and then what? You put a couple of limes in it? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=221.26s)]
*  Because you're on this ranch water kick too, aren't you? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=223.26s)]
*  I had a little ranch water the other night. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=225.26s)]
*  I had some ranch water last night. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=227.26s)]
*  You hear my voice? I had a little too much ranch water. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=229.26s)]
*  That's just the seltzer water, right? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=231.29999999999998s)]
*  In a glass bottle from Mexico. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=233.29999999999998s)]
*  But it's a fancy seltzer. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=235.29999999999998s)]
*  It's delicious. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=237.29999999999998s)]
*  And then you get lime juice in it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=238.29999999999998s)]
*  And it's just, you know, it's a very like it's basically [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  double tequila and soda with some lime. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=241.29999999999998s)]
*  It's like a margarita minus the sugar. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=243.29999999999998s)]
*  No sugar, yeah. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=245.29999999999998s)]
*  No sugar. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=246.29999999999998s)]
*  It goes down very smooth, very refreshing. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=247.29999999999998s)]
*  You got to have a good tequila for it to work. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=249.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I don't bother with the mixers or the fruit [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=251.29999999999998s)]
*  or any of that stuff. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=254.29999999999998s)]
*  It's just I'll drink it on the rocks. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=255.29999999999998s)]
*  I can't be bothered with anything that is ranch and water. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=257.3s)]
*  It just seems so down market. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=260.34000000000003s)]
*  It seems nasty. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=262.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's a Texas thing. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=263.34000000000003s)]
*  It's a Texas. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  Down market. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=265.34000000000003s)]
*  No, if you're drinking a high quality spirit, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=266.34000000000003s)]
*  you don't need to mix it with anything. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=268.34000000000003s)]
*  If it's a bad spirit, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=270.34000000000003s)]
*  then you got to put all sorts of things in it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=272.34000000000003s)]
*  But you don't add seltzer to white wine, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  to a good white wine. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=276.34000000000003s)]
*  When Bobby Baldwin was still running the Aria [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=277.34000000000003s)]
*  and I was super gambling at the Aria, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=280.34000000000003s)]
*  my host invites me [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=283.34000000000003s)]
*  and there was a huge Chinese junket at the same time. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=285.34000000000003s)]
*  And I'll never forget it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=289.38s)]
*  These guys had ordered every bottle of Screaming Eagle. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=290.38s)]
*  Okay, so whatever, five, $6,000 a bottle. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=296.38s)]
*  And Welch's grape juice, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=299.38s)]
*  and they were mixing up Screaming Eagle. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=300.38s)]
*  What? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=303.38s)]
*  I'd never seen anything like this before or since. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=304.38s)]
*  It was unbelievable. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=307.38s)]
*  This was like a joke? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=309.38s)]
*  No, that's how they drink it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=310.38s)]
*  Come on. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=312.38s)]
*  They asked for the most expensive bottle that they had, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=313.38s)]
*  the most expensive California bottle that they had. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=315.38s)]
*  These guys pull out a case of Screaming Eagle [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=317.42s)]
*  and they just start pouring. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=319.42s)]
*  We were playing together, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=320.42s)]
*  pouring half Screaming Eagle, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=321.42s)]
*  half Welch's grape juice, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=322.42s)]
*  like those grape soda. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=325.42s)]
*  I got to be honest, that does sound pretty good. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=326.42s)]
*  I don't think you need a Screaming Eagle. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=328.42s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=330.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's pretty nutty. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=331.42s)]
*  It's like a sangria. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=332.42s)]
*  The big thing now that they do [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=333.42s)]
*  is they put the big ice cube in the drinks. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=335.42s)]
*  The big cube. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=338.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=339.42s)]
*  But I think I'm old fashioned. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=340.42s)]
*  I prefer the multiple rocks, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=342.42s)]
*  not the big cube. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=344.42s)]
*  Because I actually, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=346.46000000000004s)]
*  I want the ice to melt a little bit. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=347.46000000000004s)]
*  You know, I want the drink to change. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=349.46000000000004s)]
*  You want to open it up. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=351.46000000000004s)]
*  It's a relationship. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=352.46000000000004s)]
*  It's a relationship with the drink. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=354.46000000000004s)]
*  How does it start? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=355.46000000000004s)]
*  How does it end? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=356.46000000000004s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=357.46000000000004s)]
*  David, I want an honest answer. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=358.46000000000004s)]
*  Do you have in the mausoleum [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=359.46000000000004s)]
*  an ice cube mold of your face? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=362.46000000000004s)]
*  Not... [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=366.46000000000004s)]
*  Some super fan just put that in the merch store. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=367.46000000000004s)]
*  Not on my face. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=370.46000000000004s)]
*  But we do have our own ice cubes. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=371.46000000000004s)]
*  We do have our own big cubes. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=373.46000000000004s)]
*  That's the best. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=375.5s)]
*  Actually, there's a room off of the kitchen, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=376.5s)]
*  which is the ice room. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=379.5s)]
*  So they bring the ice down from Antarctica [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=380.5s)]
*  and they cut it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=382.5s)]
*  Most of it melts because it's not there. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=383.5s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=385.5s)]
*  It's the best. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=386.5s)]
*  Sax is the best. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=387.5s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=388.5s)]
*  But it opens up, right? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=389.5s)]
*  So tell me more about the relationship with it. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=390.5s)]
*  You start, you got a very powerful, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=392.5s)]
*  strong relationship with it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=394.5s)]
*  And then you what? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=396.5s)]
*  Ease into it. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=397.5s)]
*  It gets smooth. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=398.5s)]
*  I mean, the reason why they do the big cube in theory, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=399.5s)]
*  I mean, it looks cool, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=401.5s)]
*  but is because when the ice is kind of in one cube like that, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=402.54s)]
*  it doesn't melt or it doesn't melt as fast. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=406.54s)]
*  And so it doesn't water down the drink. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=408.54s)]
*  But I want the ice to melt a little bit. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=410.54s)]
*  You know, easier to drink. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=412.54s)]
*  When we drink scotch, yeah. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=414.54s)]
*  Sax, when you're drinking bourbon, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=415.54s)]
*  is the whole shtick around Pappy Van Winkle, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=417.54s)]
*  is that real or is that just like marketing? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=419.54s)]
*  It's a little bit like screaming eagle, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=421.54s)]
*  which is to say it's good, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=423.54s)]
*  but is it 10 times better than the, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=425.54s)]
*  you know, $300 bourbon? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=427.54s)]
*  No. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=430.54s)]
*  So there are other good bourbons, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=431.58000000000004s)]
*  but Pappy is very good. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=433.58000000000004s)]
*  It is undoubtedly very good. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=434.58000000000004s)]
*  And what makes a bourbon good versus average versus shitty? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=436.58000000000004s)]
*  It's, I'd say... [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=441.58000000000004s)]
*  Like, can you taste it like wine? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=442.58000000000004s)]
*  Like you can taste the difference in wine or not really? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=444.58000000000004s)]
*  It's about how smooth it is. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=446.58000000000004s)]
*  Personally, I don't want bite in either my bourbon or my tequila. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=448.58000000000004s)]
*  So, you know, how smooth that is. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=452.58000000000004s)]
*  And then bourbon compared to scotch tends to be sweeter, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=454.58000000000004s)]
*  but you don't want it to be too sweet. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=457.58000000000004s)]
*  So just getting that balance right. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=459.62s)]
*  You know, these new tequilas are kind of like that as well. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=461.62s)]
*  You know, you choose how much bite you want [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=464.62s)]
*  and how sweet you want it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=466.62s)]
*  Three things you don't want to bite in. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=467.62s)]
*  Bourbon, scotch and... [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=469.62s)]
*  Whoa! [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=470.62s)]
*  Whoa! [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=472.62s)]
*  Do you guys ever have a drink with a Collins ice? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=479.62s)]
*  You ever have the Collins ice? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=481.62s)]
*  Do you know what that is? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=482.62s)]
*  Check this out. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=484.62s)]
*  This is becoming a trend. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=486.62s)]
*  They cut a very long rectangular ice. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=488.66s)]
*  What do they call that? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=491.66s)]
*  Highball? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=492.66s)]
*  Is that a highball? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=493.66s)]
*  Or is a highball the shorter glass? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=494.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=495.66s)]
*  No, I thought highball is the short glass. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=496.66s)]
*  No? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=498.66s)]
*  That's the short glass, which makes no sense [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=499.66s)]
*  because they call it a highball. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=500.66s)]
*  But anyway, there's a funny meme [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=501.66s)]
*  where you take this drink and you... [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=503.66s)]
*  They show this and it's like, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=505.66s)]
*  what happens when your venture capitalists [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=507.66s)]
*  after your venture capitalists get their preferred [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=509.66s)]
*  and their liquidation preference [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=512.66s)]
*  and they pull the ice cube out [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=514.66s)]
*  and there's one ounce of drink left. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=515.66s)]
*  That's great. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=518.66s)]
*  That's the prep stack right there. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=519.66s)]
*  It's the prep stack. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=521.66s)]
*  This explains the prep stack. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=522.66s)]
*  Your comment is the liquid around that ice cube. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=524.66s)]
*  That's really good. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=527.66s)]
*  That's really good. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=528.66s)]
*  Can I admit something, which may be totally derided, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=530.66s)]
*  but I have to say, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=534.66s)]
*  have you guys ever had a Cosmo in a short glass? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=536.66s)]
*  Meaning not in a martini glass, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=539.66s)]
*  but just a Cosmo in a short glass? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=541.66s)]
*  In a guy glass. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=543.66s)]
*  Yeah, guy glass. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=544.66s)]
*  Yeah, guy glass. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=545.66s)]
*  I think when a Cosmo is made well, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=546.6999999999999s)]
*  it's an incredible drink. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=548.6999999999999s)]
*  Do you guys like... [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=550.6999999999999s)]
*  Too many ingredients. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=551.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, nobody here is going with you on this one, pal. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=552.6999999999999s)]
*  You're on your own. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=555.6999999999999s)]
*  Pass. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=556.6999999999999s)]
*  I don't drink hard alcohol, but when I do, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=557.6999999999999s)]
*  it's a Cosmo in a short glass. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=560.6999999999999s)]
*  You like a chit chat. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=562.6999999999999s)]
*  There are so many better... [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=563.6999999999999s)]
*  What about a Negroni? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=564.6999999999999s)]
*  It's not sweet enough for me. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=565.6999999999999s)]
*  I like a Cosmo. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=567.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=568.6999999999999s)]
*  And a Margarita. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=569.6999999999999s)]
*  I guess I like sweet drinks. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=570.6999999999999s)]
*  I like Margaritas. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=571.6999999999999s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=572.6999999999999s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=573.6999999999999s)]
*  How long did it take you to do that? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=574.74s)]
*  Just did it. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=576.74s)]
*  It's a good background for today. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=579.74s)]
*  What is it? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=580.74s)]
*  Oh, there's the Entourage background. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=581.74s)]
*  Yeah, I'm friends with a lot of the Entourage guys now. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=582.74s)]
*  I know Adrian and I know Turtle, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=585.74s)]
*  who is a big Knicks fan. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=590.74s)]
*  So I'm friends with two of the four. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=592.74s)]
*  Two of the four. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=594.74s)]
*  Really nice guys. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=595.74s)]
*  When you say you know them, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=596.74s)]
*  you mean you've DM'd with them [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=597.74s)]
*  or you've done something in human life with them? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=598.74s)]
*  I've hung out with Adrian Grenier many times. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=600.74s)]
*  He's big in tech. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=602.74s)]
*  He's like a venture partner in a fund. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=603.78s)]
*  And he lives in Texas, well known, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=606.78s)]
*  public that he's in the Austin area. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=608.78s)]
*  So I've seen him many times. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=610.78s)]
*  I think Sax has too. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=611.78s)]
*  He rides in our circles. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=612.78s)]
*  And then, yeah, Turtle is a huge Knicks fan [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=614.78s)]
*  and I'm in a group chat with him [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=618.78s)]
*  where we talk about the Knicks. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=619.78s)]
*  So shout out. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=620.78s)]
*  And they're bringing it back, by the way. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=622.78s)]
*  There's a big fight between, I guess, Mark Wahlberg [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=624.78s)]
*  and two of the creators. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=627.78s)]
*  But the whole cast wants to come back. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=629.78s)]
*  And then they want to do, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=631.8199999999999s)]
*  like what would Ari Gold be like [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=632.8199999999999s)]
*  in this era of cancellations and political correctness? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=635.8199999999999s)]
*  And I think that would be... [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=639.8199999999999s)]
*  He's got to be a softer character too [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=641.8199999999999s)]
*  now that he's grown up. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=643.8199999999999s)]
*  He's matured. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=644.8199999999999s)]
*  He's passed the heyday of his career. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=645.8199999999999s)]
*  He's reflecting on life a bit. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=647.8199999999999s)]
*  It could be really good. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=649.8199999999999s)]
*  Well, that would have been a plot line. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=650.8199999999999s)]
*  You put him in the middle of a cancellation crisis. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=651.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=654.8199999999999s)]
*  Jerry Ferraro. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=655.8199999999999s)]
*  He probably has to issue an apology of some kind. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=656.8199999999999s)]
*  Something from the past. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=658.8199999999999s)]
*  Some texts he sent to some producer in the past. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=659.86s)]
*  Yeah, what would be great is [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=661.86s)]
*  if I think the best entourage reboot [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=663.86s)]
*  would be making him the head of Disney or something. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=666.86s)]
*  Like he's in charge of the studio. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=668.86s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=671.86s)]
*  And then... [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=672.86s)]
*  By the way, are you seeing this Snow White backlash? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=673.86s)]
*  Oh, here we go. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=676.86s)]
*  Go, bro. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=677.86s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=678.86s)]
*  Here's your red name. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=679.86s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=680.86s)]
*  I'm not going to see the movie [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=681.86s)]
*  and I don't care much about it. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=682.86s)]
*  Oh, you're not going to see Snow White? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=683.86s)]
*  But it's another Disney faux pas. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=684.86s)]
*  Where conservatives are backlashing [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=687.9s)]
*  against this revisionist take on Snow White. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=689.9s)]
*  The dwarves apparently are no longer dwarves. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=692.9s)]
*  They're just people with funky hair. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=695.9s)]
*  No way. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=698.9s)]
*  Really? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=699.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=700.9s)]
*  They made the dwarves non-dwarves? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=701.9s)]
*  I think they're still called dwarves, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=703.9s)]
*  but they're normal height people. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=704.9s)]
*  My Lord. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=707.9s)]
*  But they've got blue hair or pink hair. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=708.9s)]
*  Well, this is the thing. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=710.9s)]
*  The term dwarf, I think, is not a good word. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=711.9s)]
*  I think there's some in the community, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=716.9399999999999s)]
*  some debate if it's offensive or not. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=719.9399999999999s)]
*  So I don't know if it is, if it is. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=721.9399999999999s)]
*  Apologies. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=723.9399999999999s)]
*  In the small person community? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=724.9399999999999s)]
*  Like what community? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=726.9399999999999s)]
*  Person, there is a term, person of short stature, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=728.9399999999999s)]
*  little person and dwarf. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=731.9399999999999s)]
*  Those are the commonly used terms [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=733.9399999999999s)]
*  according to the internet. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=734.9399999999999s)]
*  I don't think you get cancel pronouns, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=736.9399999999999s)]
*  but I do think it's a sensitive subject [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=737.9399999999999s)]
*  and there are some differences of opinions. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=739.9399999999999s)]
*  Anyway, somebody who is a person of short stature [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=741.9399999999999s)]
*  complained about this, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=745.98s)]
*  and then a bunch of folks [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=747.98s)]
*  who are persons of short stature [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=749.98s)]
*  were very upset [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=751.98s)]
*  because how many iconic roles are there [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=755.98s)]
*  for people who are in this? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=758.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=761.98s)]
*  Well, this is kind of an ancillary issue, Jason. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=762.98s)]
*  The main thing that's raised hackles [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=763.98s)]
*  is that the actress who plays Snow White [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=765.98s)]
*  has been giving all these interviews [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=767.98s)]
*  in which she's trashing the original movie [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=769.98s)]
*  and basically saying that Prince Charming [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=771.98s)]
*  was a stalker in the original [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=774.02s)]
*  and so they had to change that. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=776.02s)]
*  And so you have to remember that [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=778.02s)]
*  Snow White was the original IP of Disney. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=779.02s)]
*  That was the first big movie they did [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=781.02s)]
*  that put them on the map. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=783.02s)]
*  I think before that it was more like [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=785.02s)]
*  short animated films. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=787.02s)]
*  And I think Snow White was the one [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=789.02s)]
*  that Walt Disney figured out [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=790.02s)]
*  we could make a feature length animated movie [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=791.02s)]
*  and it made the Walt Disney Company. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=793.02s)]
*  So you have here this actress [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=795.02s)]
*  is taking a lot of heat [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=797.02s)]
*  because she's saying a lot of things [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=798.02s)]
*  sort of trashing their original movie. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=799.02s)]
*  Now, I personally don't blame her [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=802.06s)]
*  because the things she's saying, I think, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=804.06s)]
*  are the filmmakers' intent. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=806.06s)]
*  And so really you have to question [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=808.06s)]
*  the wisdom of the executives at Disney [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=810.06s)]
*  who could have left this material alone. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=812.06s)]
*  They didn't have to go here. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=816.06s)]
*  But they did decide to go here. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=818.06s)]
*  They did decide to do a remake. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=819.06s)]
*  And they changed all these things. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=821.06s)]
*  Why even bother? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=822.06s)]
*  All you're going to do is ruin [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=824.06s)]
*  the public's perception of the original. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=826.06s)]
*  Yeah, that would be like the new star [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=828.06s)]
*  people being like, oh, my God, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=830.0999999999999s)]
*  Han Solo was a misogynist. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=831.0999999999999s)]
*  And it's like, well, yeah, he was a scoundrel. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=833.0999999999999s)]
*  They literally call him a scoundrel. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=835.0999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he's not the best guy, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=837.0999999999999s)]
*  but he has an arc and he turns around. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=839.0999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's a problem with trying to [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=840.0999999999999s)]
*  have to look at art in context, obviously. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=842.0999999999999s)]
*  And speaking of which, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=845.0999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you guys saw this. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=846.0999999999999s)]
*  There wasn't a need for them to rehabilitate [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=847.0999999999999s)]
*  that movie by remaking it [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=849.0999999999999s)]
*  in a completely different way. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=850.0999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, here's how you say it. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=852.0999999999999s)]
*  Standards have changed over 100 years. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=853.0999999999999s)]
*  So some of the things that you might see [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=856.0999999999999s)]

*  of this song that has rocketed to number one? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=866.14s)]

*  Because I haven't heard it. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=879.14s)]
*  Let me play you a little bit. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=880.14s)]
*  I want you to just listen to some of the lyrics here [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=881.14s)]

*  I want you to just listen to some of the lyrics here [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=885.18s)]
*  and then for context, nobody knew the song a week ago. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=887.18s)]
*  It got 25 million views on X in a week or three days. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=890.18s)]

*  Incredible. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=962.2199999999999s)]
*  When you hear the song, I saw that Sax was getting into it. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=963.2199999999999s)]
*  This is a popular song. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=966.2199999999999s)]

*  I'm into it. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=971.2199999999999s)]
*  It's the 80 million people. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=972.26s)]
*  Who voted for Trump. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=974.26s)]
*  That you know if you read the top YouTube comment. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=975.26s)]
*  It's the 80 million people. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=977.26s)]
*  That feel like they don't have a voice that. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=978.26s)]
*  You know Trump was speaking to. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=980.26s)]
*  He sounds like Wesley Schultz of the Lumineers. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=982.26s)]
*  The beautiful voice. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=985.26s)]
*  But obviously the lyrics are what speak to people. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=986.26s)]
*  And he delivers it so well. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=988.26s)]
*  Let's do a little all in for the first time. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=990.26s)]
*  A little cultural. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=993.26s)]
*  You know what would you call this? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=995.26s)]
*  Appreciation of the lyrics here. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=997.26s)]
*  Or an analysis. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=998.26s)]
*  I've been selling my soul. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1000.3s)]
*  Working all day. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1002.3s)]
*  Over time hours. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1003.3s)]
*  For bullshit pay. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1004.3s)]
*  So I can sit out here. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1005.3s)]
*  And waste my life away. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1007.3s)]
*  Drag back home. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1008.3s)]
*  And drown my troubles away. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1010.3s)]
*  It's a damn shame what the world's gotten to. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1012.3s)]
*  For people like me. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1014.3s)]
*  People like you. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1015.3s)]
*  Wish I could just wake up. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1016.3s)]
*  And it not be true. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1017.3s)]
*  But it is. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1018.3s)]
*  Living in the new world. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1019.3s)]
*  With an old soul. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1020.3s)]
*  These rich men. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1021.3s)]
*  North of Richmond. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1022.3s)]
*  Huh? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1023.3s)]
*  Lord knows they just want to have total control. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1024.3s)]
*  This is a key line. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1027.3s)]
*  They just want to have total control. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1029.34s)]
*  They want to know what you think, Zax. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1031.34s)]
*  They want to know what you do. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1033.34s)]
*  And they don't think you know. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1035.34s)]
*  But I know you do. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1037.34s)]
*  And so what's happening here is. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1039.34s)]
*  The author of the song, the lyricist. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1041.34s)]
*  Is saying. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1043.34s)]
*  This is about big tech. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1045.34s)]
*  This is about the CIA. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1046.34s)]
*  This is about the FBI. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1048.34s)]
*  Tracking us. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1049.34s)]
*  And then thinking that we're schlubs. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1051.34s)]
*  That we don't know they're tracking us. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1053.34s)]
*  They don't know they're tracking the work of man. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1055.34s)]
*  But the author speaks to the listener. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1057.3799999999999s)]
*  And says. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1059.3799999999999s)]
*  I know you do. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1060.3799999999999s)]
*  Just let it sink in. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1062.3799999999999s)]
*  Huh? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1064.3799999999999s)]
*  Do you have any lyrics here that spoke to you? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1065.3799999999999s)]
*  Friedberg. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1067.3799999999999s)]
*  I know that you're living this blue collar life. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1068.3799999999999s)]
*  I just want to wax philosophical for a second. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1070.3799999999999s)]
*  I do think that. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1072.3799999999999s)]
*  You know for all humans to find happiness in life. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1074.3799999999999s)]
*  They have to feel like they're progressing. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1077.3799999999999s)]
*  And if folks are not progressing. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1079.3799999999999s)]
*  Because of challenges they face in the world. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1081.3799999999999s)]
*  There's always an orientation. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1083.3799999999999s)]
*  That the system isn't delivering to me the things that it was supposed to deliver. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1085.42s)]
*  Or the system is rigged and corrupt against me. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1088.42s)]
*  That's been the case for all of human history. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1091.42s)]
*  It's certainly the case today. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1093.42s)]
*  You know you read Thomas Piketty's book. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1095.42s)]
*  Capital. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1097.42s)]
*  He speaks so much about wealth disparity. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1098.42s)]
*  In an era of globalization. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1100.42s)]
*  In an era of technification. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1102.42s)]
*  In an era when the world is seeing. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1104.42s)]
*  Some people have extraordinary gains. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1107.42s)]
*  But most people not. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1109.42s)]
*  On a relative basis. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1110.42s)]
*  And that voice. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1112.42s)]
*  Speaks to a system that is preventing those folks from. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1113.46s)]
*  Finding that path in life that they believe they're due. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1116.46s)]
*  And that they think is obviously something that everyone should be born. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1119.46s)]
*  To be able to pursue. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1122.46s)]
*  I think it's beautifully said. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1124.46s)]
*  It's beautifully said. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1125.46s)]
*  It really speaks to the core and the heart of what people term this populism. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1126.46s)]
*  I hate that term. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1130.46s)]
*  But it's a lack of progressivism. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1131.46s)]
*  It's the fact that folks don't feel like they can progress. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1133.46s)]
*  Not just in the US. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1135.46s)]
*  Around the world today. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1137.46s)]
*  But really the US voice is so strong and so loud on this point. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1138.46s)]
*  It's why Trump was elected. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1141.5s)]
*  That the system. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1143.5s)]
*  Whether it's the companies. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1144.5s)]
*  The people. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1146.5s)]
*  The institutions. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1147.5s)]
*  The large, large, large. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1149.5s)]
*  Federal government agencies. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1151.5s)]
*  Are preventing folks clogging up. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1153.5s)]
*  Giving people. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1155.5s)]
*  Not delivering to the people the things that they said that they would. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1156.5s)]
*  And not enabling them to progress on their own. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1159.5s)]
*  And I think that's really. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1162.5s)]
*  This song encapsulates the emotion of that feeling so well. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1163.5s)]
*  I think it also. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1167.5s)]
*  I think that's what's going on. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1168.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1169.5s)]
*  And I think that's what's actually said. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1170.54s)]
*  And I think to build on that and then bring Sramathan here. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1171.54s)]
*  There's something unique about the American spirit. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1173.54s)]
*  That we're never happy. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1175.54s)]
*  That we're always striving. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1176.54s)]
*  And I think this also encapsulates this. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1178.54s)]
*  And if you look at the European spirit. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1180.54s)]
*  Specifically Italy where you are right now. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1182.54s)]
*  There are people who very much enjoy life and accept life. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1184.54s)]
*  And have maybe a little more peace and happiness. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1187.54s)]
*  And aren't trying to. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1189.54s)]
*  You know upgrade, upgrade, upgrade. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1191.54s)]
*  To get the latest version of whatever it is. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1193.54s)]
*  Car, boat, house. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1195.54s)]
*  You know iPod. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1196.54s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1197.54s)]
*  And it's super interesting this lyric. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1198.58s)]
*  Because it shows this frustration. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1203.58s)]
*  And if you think about the frustration, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1205.58s)]
*  Friberg, to your point. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1206.58s)]
*  We have the lowest unemployment in the history of this country. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1207.58s)]
*  In our lifetime I should say. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1210.58s)]
*  And wars aside. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1212.58s)]
*  And when we have 10, 20% unemployment in certain groups. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1214.58s)]
*  People complain about that. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1217.58s)]
*  People complain about their retirements. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1219.58s)]
*  We complain here about our portfolios. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1221.58s)]
*  And our equity positions. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1223.58s)]
*  And them being down. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1224.58s)]
*  Everybody in America complains. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1225.58s)]
*  It's why we are so successful. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1227.62s)]
*  Is because we never accept it. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1229.62s)]
*  And we never actually take a moment to smell the roses. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1231.62s)]
*  Chamath any thoughts on that? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1233.62s)]
*  And then I'll just read some more lyrics. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1235.62s)]
*  And then go to sex. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1237.62s)]
*  I don't know how to reconcile. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1238.62s)]
*  All of this with the other part of America. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1240.62s)]
*  Which is you pull yourself up by your bootstraps. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1243.62s)]
*  And the system still roughly works. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1246.62s)]
*  How do you make those two things. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1250.62s)]
*  Work together. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1252.62s)]
*  It just seems like. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1254.62s)]
*  One cohort of people says the system is rigged. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1257.62s)]
*  Another cohort of people say. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1260.62s)]
*  If you work really hard. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1262.62s)]
*  America will give you a better chance than anybody else. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1263.62s)]
*  And it still does. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1265.62s)]
*  And it still does a better job than it ever did. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1266.62s)]
*  And there are umpteen examples that they'll point to. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1268.62s)]
*  So who's right? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1272.62s)]
*  Is it that they're both right? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1273.62s)]
*  I think it is. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1274.62s)]
*  I was about to say. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1275.62s)]
*  I think it's both right. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1276.62s)]
*  You could have a group of people. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1277.62s)]
*  Who are unhappy with their current condition. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1279.62s)]
*  And there are people from around the world. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1281.62s)]
*  Who look at America and say. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1283.62s)]
*  I want to be part of that system. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1284.62s)]
*  If only I could be in that country. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1286.6599999999999s)]
*  In fact. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1288.6599999999999s)]
*  All three of your parents. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1289.6599999999999s)]
*  Freebird, Sachs and Shamath. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1291.6599999999999s)]
*  Said that. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1293.6599999999999s)]
*  I need to get there. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1294.6599999999999s)]
*  I need to get to America. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1295.6599999999999s)]
*  Sachs your thoughts. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1296.6599999999999s)]
*  On Shamath's point about this disparity. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1297.6599999999999s)]
*  This paradox. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1299.6599999999999s)]
*  So the way I interpret. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1300.6599999999999s)]
*  This word. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1301.6599999999999s)]
*  Populism. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1302.6599999999999s)]
*  Is failure of the elites. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1303.6599999999999s)]
*  When you hear people. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1304.6599999999999s)]
*  Expressing. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1305.6599999999999s)]
*  Populist thoughts. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1306.6599999999999s)]
*  What they're really saying is that the people running this country. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1307.6599999999999s)]
*  The ruling class. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1310.6599999999999s)]
*  The elite. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1311.6599999999999s)]
*  Has failed. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1312.6599999999999s)]
*  And. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1313.6599999999999s)]
*  It's just seen with two years of COVID. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1314.7s)]
*  That the ruling class. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1316.7s)]
*  Got everything wrong. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1318.7s)]
*  Pushed these. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1319.7s)]
*  Insanely destructive lockdowns. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1320.7s)]
*  Lied about every aspect of the virus. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1322.7s)]
*  And pushed a vaccine that didn't work. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1324.7s)]
*  So I don't want to rehash COVID. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1326.7s)]
*  But the point is just the elite. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1328.7s)]
*  The ruling class completely failed. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1330.7s)]
*  And yet their failure was covered up by the media. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1331.7s)]
*  It's the best example. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1333.7s)]
*  Let's just say it. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1335.7s)]
*  Let's just call it what it is. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1336.7s)]
*  It is the best example. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1337.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1338.7s)]
*  So I think people are justifiably angry. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1339.7s)]
*  About this failure. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1341.7s)]
*  Of the elite combined. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1343.74s)]
*  With the lack of accountability. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1344.74s)]
*  Because there's not honesty about what they're getting wrong. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1346.74s)]
*  And you see this pattern repeated over and over again. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1349.74s)]
*  So I think it's repeated. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1351.74s)]
*  In terms of how we got into this. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1353.74s)]
*  Completely unnecessary Ukraine war. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1355.74s)]
*  It's repeated in terms of the. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1357.74s)]
*  Crisis we've had at the border. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1358.74s)]
*  It's repeated in terms of the export of all of these. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1360.74s)]
*  Industrial jobs. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1363.74s)]
*  To other countries. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1365.74s)]
*  And that has. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1366.74s)]
*  Collapse of cities. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1367.74s)]
*  Collapse of cities. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1368.74s)]
*  Collapse of cities with you know. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1369.74s)]
*  Again we have hundreds of thousands of people living on the streets. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1371.78s)]
*  I think all of these things have made a huge difference in the lives. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1373.78s)]
*  Of many ordinary people in the country. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1377.78s)]
*  And so yeah this is a land of opportunity. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1379.78s)]
*  For people who have certain kinds of skills. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1382.78s)]
*  Listen if you are technologically inclined. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1384.78s)]
*  It's still a great country. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1387.78s)]
*  We're in this industry. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1388.78s)]
*  We know there's lots of opportunity. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1389.78s)]
*  It's always a great time to start a company. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1391.78s)]
*  But many people in the country have been adversely impacted by. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1393.78s)]
*  These policies. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1396.78s)]
*  And there appears to be no willingness. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1398.78s)]
*  Of the ruling class to admit the problem and make changes. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1400.82s)]
*  The line Jason you quoted where it was kind of like. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1402.82s)]
*  They know we know and they keep doing it anyway. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1405.82s)]
*  It reminds me of a line from Solzhenitsyn. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1407.82s)]

*  And they're left with flat earnings. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1497.94s)]
*  Over several decades. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1498.94s)]

*  And because of this. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1502.94s)]
*  The top 20%. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1503.94s)]

*  An outsized amount of the assets. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1507.94s)]
*  An outsized amount of the income. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1508.94s)]
*  As we all know. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1510.94s)]
*  And have all benefited from. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1511.94s)]
*  And the vast majority of Americans. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1513.94s)]
*  So. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1515.98s)]
*  That have been working. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1516.98s)]
*  I have a question. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1517.98s)]
*  I have a question for Freeberg. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1518.98s)]
*  Freeberg. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1519.98s)]
*  Do you think that. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1520.98s)]
*  We should implement policies to change. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1521.98s)]
*  The lines on this graph. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1524.98s)]
*  Exactly what I was going to ask. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1526.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1528.98s)]
*  I want to reference you guys to the Tim Ferriss interview with Charles Koch. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1529.98s)]
*  From a couple years ago. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1533.98s)]
*  In that interview. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1535.98s)]
*  He gives a really good example. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1536.98s)]
*  And I'm going to mess this up a bit. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1537.98s)]
*  But he talks about how certain women that are hairdressers in the inner city. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1539.98s)]
*  They want to go do this. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1544.02s)]
*  Hair braiding thing. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1545.02s)]
*  But in order to do it. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1546.02s)]
*  They have to pay thousands of dollars. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1547.02s)]
*  To school. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1549.02s)]
*  To get certified. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1550.02s)]
*  And then they have to go to the city to get a license. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1551.02s)]
*  In order to be able to do that job. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1554.02s)]
*  So the economic cost of getting there is insurmountable for them. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1556.02s)]
*  And there's countless examples like this. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1559.02s)]
*  Where in the US. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1561.02s)]
*  We've created policies that have. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1562.02s)]
*  Attempted to. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1564.02s)]
*  Be forms of protection. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1565.02s)]
*  Or perhaps be forms of income generation. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1567.02s)]
*  For cities and governments and so on. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1569.02s)]
*  That in the process. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1571.02s)]
*  Unfortunately. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1572.02s)]
*  Have limited. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1573.06s)]
*  The mobility. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1574.06s)]
*  Of people that want to be individual earners and entrepreneurs in the US. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1575.06s)]
*  I think that is the first thing I would do to address this problem. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1578.06s)]
*  Give every American the opportunity to be an entrepreneur. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1581.06s)]
*  To build their own path. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1584.06s)]
*  Do you think that hair braiding, licensing. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1586.06s)]
*  Fixing that problem. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1588.06s)]
*  Will cause the. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1590.06s)]
*  Dashed black line. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1591.06s)]
*  Or the blue line. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1593.06s)]
*  To shrink. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1595.06s)]
*  Or. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1596.06s)]
*  I guess what I'm trying to ask you is. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1597.06s)]
*  Should those lines shrink? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1599.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1600.06s)]
*  I don't think it's the government's role. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1601.1s)]
*  Right? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1602.1s)]
*  I mean. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1603.1s)]
*  I'll tell you. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1604.1s)]

*  I just want to hear. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1606.1s)]
*  I want to hear. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1607.1s)]
*  I want to hear Friedberg's answer. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1608.1s)]
*  Jason. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1609.1s)]
*  I'll answer the question. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1610.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1611.1s)]
*  I've said this in the past. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1612.1s)]
*  If you shrink those lines. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1613.1s)]
*  You will limit. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1616.1s)]
*  Overall progress. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1618.1s)]
*  And what I mean by progress is improvements in productivity. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1619.1s)]
*  Improvements and advances in technology. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1622.1s)]

*  Many times in the past. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1633.1399999999999s)]
*  There's a certain limit. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1634.1399999999999s)]
*  On taxation. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1635.1399999999999s)]
*  So one method is to tax. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1636.1399999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1637.1399999999999s)]
*  Pull more money out of the top earners. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1638.1399999999999s)]
*  And redistribute it. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1639.1399999999999s)]
*  The problem is. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1640.1399999999999s)]
*  When you do that. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1641.1399999999999s)]

*  So. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1648.1399999999999s)]
*  There is a cost to doing that. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1649.1399999999999s)]

*  In recent years. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1660.5s)]

*  I just want to know what you think. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1665.5s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1667.3400000000001s)]

*  So I don't think it's about taking away from the top. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1672.8000000000002s)]
*  As much as it's about enabling the bottom. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1675.0800000000002s)]

*  And this is. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1680.46s)]

*  He's just doing. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1690.9s)]
*  You know whatever we want to do to try and make everyone equal and end up in a central [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1691.9s)]
*  state. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1692.9s)]
*  Here's my issue. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1693.9s)]
*  The way that you present it. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1694.9s)]
*  Like you tell it in a language. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1695.9s)]
*  And even I felt it. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1697.18s)]
*  Where I was like wow this guy is really empathizing. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1698.18s)]
*  Wow my god. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1700.0s)]
*  He's really. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1701.0s)]
*  But then the follow up to like what would you do. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1702.0s)]
*  Is non existent. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1704.9s)]
*  And I think that that's the real problem. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1705.9s)]
*  A lot of people want to pretend that this is an issue. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1707.9s)]
*  And they want to get the sympathy of the masses by giving the populist rhetoric of why this [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1710.9s)]
*  is an issue. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1714.82s)]
*  So when push comes to shove and the question is do you believe that the dashed black line [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1715.98s)]
*  or the blue line should be legislatively brought down to meet the other lines. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1720.5400000000002s)]
*  People just evade the question. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1726.8600000000001s)]
*  In my perspective the answer is no. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1728.22s)]
*  You cannot do that. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1730.52s)]
*  And the reason why United States GDP is where it is is because of that dashed line. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1732.26s)]
*  It's an existence proof of the fact that this is the largest economy in the world. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1737.0400000000002s)]
*  And so one has to make a really simplistic decision which is do you want economic supremacy [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1741.3799999999999s)]
*  and then try to figure out ways of rebalancing things or do you not. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1747.1799999999998s)]
*  I say you absolutely must start with that which means that that dashed line and that [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1751.98s)]
*  blue line will always have a rate of acceleration that is greater than the other lines. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1757.02s)]
*  And that's just natural OPEX leverage that exists in any company. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1763.62s)]
*  If you look at a company with 50 percent EBITDA margins versus a company with 15 percent [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1767.0s)]
*  EBITDA margins because one uses technology and the other one doesn't. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1771.88s)]
*  It's capitalism is right with these examples. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1776.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1779.64s)]
*  Chamath that is the smartest thing you've said in 142 episodes of the All In Pod. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1780.44s)]
*  But I agree 100 percent Chamath with your. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1787.12s)]
*  I think it's well said. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1789.72s)]
*  But then you should just say it. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1790.44s)]
*  I think we do a huge disservice by pretending to care and then not seeing the ugly truth. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1791.6s)]
*  The ugly truth is none of us want the government to try to bring that dashed black line or [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1798.36s)]
*  that blue line down. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1804.8799999999999s)]
*  We want them to stay out of our way. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1807.24s)]
*  That is the truth. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1809.04s)]
*  Yep. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1810.9599999999998s)]
*  So if you talk to that guy that wrote that song and his 80 million followers. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1812.76s)]
*  He I don't think you say to them. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1817.04s)]
*  What do you say to them? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1820.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1821.56s)]
*  Can I take a shot at this? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1822.56s)]
*  It's my honest answer. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1823.56s)]
*  I want to get Saxon. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1824.56s)]
*  OK, look, I think when you see a chart like that, the natural instinct is that you want [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1825.56s)]
*  to argue for redistribution. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1830.76s)]
*  You basically want to take from one of the top lines and just give it to one of the bottom [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1832.8s)]
*  lines. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1837.28s)]
*  And I think that only works to a degree. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1838.32s)]
*  I think it's important that we have a social safety net. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1839.96s)]
*  But what we've seen is that Marxist redistribution doesn't ultimately work. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1842.68s)]
*  It actually makes a society for. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1846.64s)]
*  I think this is where Chamath is right. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1848.1200000000001s)]
*  The simplistic solutions don't work. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1849.28s)]
*  We're not going to move from fundamentally a capitalist system to a sort of Marxist redistributive [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1851.28s)]
*  system. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1856.8799999999999s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that we can't do things to improve the situation for the average American. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1857.8799999999999s)]
*  And I think there the policies are more complicated. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1864.48s)]
*  But I think we could have much more prudent handling of our fiscal situation so that inflation, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1866.92s)]
*  for example, doesn't eat away the wages of American workers. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1874.6s)]
*  I think we could have a much more sensible immigration policy so that there's not, I [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1877.56s)]
*  think, a lot of competition for let's call it low end jobs. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1881.8799999999999s)]
*  I think we could have had a better trade policy with China over the last 20 years. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1886.56s)]
*  I think there are things that we could do that were more nuanced that would have improved [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1891.52s)]
*  the situation for working class Americans. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1895.4s)]
*  And we didn't do it. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1898.4s)]
*  And you compound that with, again, all these elite failures around things like COVID, around [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1899.56s)]
*  things like foreign wars. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1905.6s)]
*  Let's add to this the Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1907.56s)]
*  critique of regulatory capture that the military industrial complex is bleeding this country [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1910.6399999999999s)]
*  dry. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1915.9199999999998s)]
*  And I think you add all those things together and I can see why there are complaints. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1918.04s)]
*  There have been three major responses over the past 50 years to this problem, the one [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1923.0s)]
*  and all of them involve creating budget dollars to fund access to everyone of three major [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1927.36s)]
*  things, which is health care, education and housing. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1934.84s)]
*  And it sounds good in principle. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1938.08s)]
*  It is a good thing to say everyone deserves to have access to buying a home. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1940.72s)]
*  Everyone deserves to have access to an education. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1945.08s)]
*  Everyone deserves to have access to health care. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1947.08s)]
*  The problem is when the federal government has stepped in to build the programs to provide [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1949.12s)]
*  these solutions, they've created extraordinary incentive problems that have caused asset [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1954.6s)]
*  bubbles and have ultimately caused failure in the underlying system that you're trying [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1959.56s)]
*  to give everyone access to. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1963.52s)]
*  We have told every American that they should put all of their net worth and more into their [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1964.96s)]
*  house. And as a result, we've had to continue to drive up the price of housing in the US, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1969.12s)]
*  drive up, create a housing bubble by pouring a ton of capital in to keep that asset safe [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1973.68s)]
*  and protected because it is where most Americans have put their nest egg. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1978.68s)]
*  We've given everyone access to an education by giving free student loans out. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1982.52s)]
*  And those student loans have caused an asset bubble in the price of education. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1986.68s)]
*  And we have tried to provide health care to everyone through the federal government that [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1990.48s)]
*  has no accountability. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1994.04s)]
*  And as a result, the cost of health care has ballooned. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1995.32s)]
*  So I think the one question for you guys is in the sense that most people are saying these [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=1997.56s)]
*  are three critical things that I need access to. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2002.44s)]
*  But when the federal government gets involved and provides them, the cost soars and we have [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2004.68s)]
*  all of these bubble problems and disincentives that arise in the system and money gets stolen [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2008.48s)]
*  and yada yada. What's the right solution then? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2012.0s)]
*  Right. How do you provide sex that that that, you know, that 80 percent of Americans access [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2014.76s)]
*  to these things that, you know, boost their condition in life without causing what is [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2019.44s)]
*  effectively inflation across all? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2024.04s)]
*  I don't think I have something to add here. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2025.96s)]
*  Yeah, I would like to start by just saying when we look at this chart, I think it maybe [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2027.8s)]
*  looks worse than it actually is in reality. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2031.92s)]
*  I think when you look at the chart, you say, oh, my God, this is terrible. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2035.4s)]
*  But there are people around the world who are fighting to get in this country who want to [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2038.24s)]
*  be part of this chart. Now, why do they want to be part of this chart? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2041.44s)]
*  It's because they perceive that, you know, even the the middle quartile, even the fourth [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2044.56s)]
*  quartile here, the bottom quartile, they feel like that's better than their lot in life in [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2049.24s)]
*  their country. So this if you were to expand it and put a couple of other countries on it, you [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2053.92s)]
*  would say, hey, even the the people who are in the fourth quartile in America are doing better [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2059.04s)]
*  than people in the middle quartile in another country. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2063.48s)]
*  And the opportunity is still here. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2066.04s)]
*  And that's my second point, which is, you know, how easy is it or how possible is it? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2068.04s)]
*  For, you know, the next generation, you know, if you came here as immigrants, like like [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2074.56s)]
*  many of you did, and obviously, you know, my grandparents did. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2080.6800000000003s)]
*  How easy is it to get from that green line to the orange, when the orange, the red, the [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2086.1200000000003s)]
*  red to the purple, et cetera? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2088.88s)]
*  That's the generalization we need to focus on. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2090.52s)]
*  Forget about all the programs. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2092.6800000000003s)]
*  Forget about tax moving up. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2094.0s)]
*  How do you move up? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2096.2000000000003s)]
*  That's a wonderful point, because I think the generalization that this chart is like [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2096.92s)]
*  chart porn, because it's meant to be titillating, but it tells a very poor story of that [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2100.4s)]
*  exact dynamic, which is if you started in the green line, which I did, you know, my [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2106.36s)]
*  parents, my parents made thirty two thousand. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2111.32s)]
*  That's the most they ever made in their best year. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2113.76s)]
*  But most of the time with welfare, we were on living on between fifteen and twenty one [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2116.8s)]
*  thousand dollars a year. Yet somehow, you know, we went from the green line to the dashed [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2120.8s)]
*  black line. So the thing that this chart isn't really representing is, is there enough [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2125.56s)]
*  people that go from green to orange, orange to red, red to purple, purple to blue, blue [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2132.4s)]
*  to dashed black? That's what really matters. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2137.28s)]
*  That's what that's why I think this chart is mostly pointless, because if in fact what [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2140.08s)]
*  you saw was that in any given cohort of people, they were not the cohort before that was [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2145.2s)]
*  in the dashed black line, you would say, wow, we're actually creating wealth distribution [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2152.0s)]
*  in a very unique way, which is an entire new cohort of people are becoming wealthy in [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2157.0s)]
*  every generation. If, however, it's the same fifty people that are in the dashed black [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2162.4s)]
*  line, obviously that's not good. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2167.2400000000002s)]
*  But our lived experience is not that. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2169.8s)]
*  So I think like the real question is like, can we just be can we find a different way [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2172.84s)]
*  of actually telling the truth, using this information so that instead of so that instead [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2177.4s)]
*  of bear hugging random populous sentiments and statements to try to win favor with [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2182.92s)]
*  people, we actually just acknowledge the problem where it lies. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2189.4s)]
*  That individual that wrote that song, which line is he on, which line was his father on [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2193.96s)]
*  and which line will his children be on? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2199.52s)]
*  That's the critical question. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2201.12s)]
*  It's not that the line shouldn't exist. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2203.0s)]
*  Yeah, and nowhere else on earth with the three of us, I mean. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2206.04s)]
*  You know, did you start, which line did you start on? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2210.88s)]
*  I started in the green. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2213.96s)]
*  I know I'm asking for a break. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2215.56s)]
*  We just started between the fourth quartile in the middle. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2216.72s)]
*  I mean, when we when we moved to the US, my parents always just look for gigs that they [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2219.92s)]
*  could make money. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2223.12s)]
*  So you were fourth quartile, you think 40K? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2224.04s)]
*  Yeah, we had no money. I don't know what to tell you. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2226.0s)]
*  I mean, we you know, my parents, we moved to L.A. when I was six years old from South [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2227.6s)]
*  Africa and they were gigs their entire lives. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2231.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think my family was from fourth to the middle and then my brothers and I all [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2234.76s)]
*  went up to at least one or two lines higher. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2239.0s)]
*  By the way, another thing that's the same. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2241.5600000000004s)]
*  Sorry, I think that's I think that's the important story. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2243.5600000000004s)]
*  If you guys read some of the comments on YouTube, which we always argue we should or [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2245.2400000000002s)]
*  shouldn't have. But, you know, but I just want to point this out. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2248.2400000000002s)]
*  There's to Chumab's point, there's immediate approximation of people based on which [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2252.36s)]
*  quartile or quintile they're in rather than an approximation on their transversal of the [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2257.6000000000004s)]
*  quartiles or quintiles or whatever. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2263.4s)]
*  I think what's what's what's really true about all four of us is that we all transverse [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2265.5600000000004s)]
*  the quintiles. We all moved from there to there and none of us were wealthy. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2270.5600000000004s)]
*  Just a few years ago, we all, you know, made our way in the world and in the United [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2274.96s)]
*  States in a way that we would not have been able to anywhere else on Earth. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2278.96s)]
*  And I do think that that is the most powerful. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2282.4s)]
*  Aspect of, you know, American liberalism and democracy. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2285.5600000000004s)]
*  I think this characterization of people based on their wealth is what's so disturbing to [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2289.48s)]
*  me because you hear it's like you hear it from AOC. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2294.7599999999998s)]
*  But it discredits the fact that those people typically were not wealthy a few years ago, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2298.8799999999997s)]
*  that the people that should be celebrated are the ones that went from not wealthy to [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2303.56s)]
*  wealthy through the means of creating things that ended up being useful and productive [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2307.48s)]
*  or whatever the system asked for. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2311.56s)]
*  And they created value there. And I think that the lack of recognition of entrepreneurship, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2314.24s)]
*  the ability for immigrants to come to this country and transverse these quintiles. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2318.88s)]
*  Yeah, but that is one of the challenges. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2322.92s)]
*  Yeah, that would require them to be a little bit curious about the individual and to not [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2324.6400000000003s)]
*  use the individual as just an object to win their argument. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2328.8s)]
*  And, you know, I think that's that is the sin of politics is that they're just using [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2332.6400000000003s)]
*  just different objects out there. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2336.88s)]
*  So let me ask you the question. What do you say to the blue collar worker in Richmond [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2338.12s)]
*  that this guy is speaking to in terms of their ability to transverse those quintiles, to [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2342.6800000000003s)]
*  go from low income earner? They're a blue collar worker. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2348.28s)]
*  They work a union job or they work as a plumber or they work in some manufacturing [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2351.0800000000004s)]
*  facilities. This is the point. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2356.0800000000004s)]
*  You're not supposed to grin fuck him. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2358.0800000000004s)]
*  So by pretending like all of this is what they hate. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2360.5600000000004s)]
*  They hate all of you fucking people grin fucking them. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2364.1600000000003s)]
*  Stop grin fucking them. Stop pretending that you care, that you really care. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2367.5600000000004s)]
*  And oh, woe is them. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2372.2400000000002s)]
*  But the reality is it is implicitly impossible for anybody on this fucking podcast. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2374.12s)]
*  To talk about how this system has not worked for them. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2381.08s)]
*  OK, and so what we need to do is actually take a step back and just acknowledge the [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2383.72s)]
*  fact that we were in the green line. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2388.56s)]
*  We somehow by a bunch of fate and luck and hard work and opportunity that this country [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2390.48s)]
*  provided. And so the real question is, what did that guy can he do differently? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2394.8399999999997s)]
*  Has he done or shouldn't have done that has kept him in there? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2400.04s)]
*  And one of the things that I would like to bring up that are that is really worth exploring [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2403.36s)]
*  for multigenerational Americans, which is not talked about enough, is when we introduced [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2407.4s)]
*  or when we I'm talking collectively, we Lyndon Johnson, really the war on poverty that [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2412.92s)]
*  had an inexorable change in the dynamics of America in black wealth, in white wealth, in [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2418.96s)]
*  the trapped amount of wealth, the destruction of nuclear families. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2425.36s)]
*  All of these trends started a few years post the introduction of the war on poverty, and [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2428.92s)]
*  nobody talks about that. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2433.4s)]
*  So I disagree with you, Friedberg, when you point to health care and those are secondary [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2434.6400000000003s)]
*  and tertiary derivatives of the actual war on poverty. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2439.32s)]
*  And that was Lyndon Johnson's signature legislation, post the assassination of JFK. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2442.92s)]
*  And nobody really looks at what that actually did to change and potentially misaligned [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2447.36s)]
*  incentives in the United States that have compounded to create this issue. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2452.08s)]
*  So I would say to the Richmond person, I have enough respect for you, sir, to not [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2455.7999999999997s)]
*  grin, fuck you and tell you how well was this graph. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2461.0s)]
*  I don't know what the solution is, and I think we just need to talk and figure out to see [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2464.48s)]
*  if there are some ideas that can improve the situation. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2469.72s)]
*  But some of them, some of them do come to the fundamental incentives that the government [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2472.7999999999997s)]
*  has created that we need to either undo or change. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2478.24s)]
*  Zach? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2481.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot of good points in there. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2483.2400000000002s)]
*  Just to echo some of the things you guys said, I think when my family came to America in [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2485.7200000000003s)]
*  1977, I think my dad was making twenty seven thousand dollars a year. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2489.08s)]
*  So it was the it was green or orange or something like that. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2493.64s)]
*  One of the bottom one or two quintiles. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2497.88s)]
*  And then we moved up because he's a doctor and had that education. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2500.7200000000003s)]
*  So, you know, how you do in this country is going to depend a lot on what kind of [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2504.56s)]
*  education you have, what kind of skills you have. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2509.2000000000003s)]
*  Like you guys are saying now, that being said, I still think there is a policy role [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2510.96s)]
*  here. I do think that a lot of the policies in this country over the last couple of [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2515.48s)]
*  decades have not been great for working class people. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2519.96s)]
*  And I think there are things we can adjust. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2522.44s)]
*  But to Trimaz's point, declaring a simple war on poverty that's based around [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2524.28s)]
*  redistribution doesn't work because what we've seen is that it also creates a lot of [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2528.2000000000003s)]
*  dependency. And so a lot of these policies backfire. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2532.04s)]
*  So simplistic redistribution is not going to solve the problem. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2535.04s)]
*  However, I do think that having a policy response that does try to create more [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2538.12s)]
*  opportunity in these working class communities again, we didn't need to hollow [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2542.48s)]
*  out our industrial communities by exporting jobs to China. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2547.56s)]
*  We didn't need to create all this low end wage pressure by basically having an open [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2553.8s)]
*  border for so many years. So there were choices that we made that did make life [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2559.0s)]
*  rougher for these people. And then when they start to complain about it, we censor [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2563.36s)]
*  them or call them deplorables. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2567.96s)]
*  And so I do think that the response that the elite has and that really the [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2570.36s)]
*  mainstream media has towards these people does fuel the alienation and polarization. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2575.32s)]
*  So we could be reacting. We could be reacting a lot better to the complaint here. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2580.4s)]
*  I'll tell you what's happened, I think, is America went from a country where people [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2585.0s)]
*  pulled themselves up by the bootstraps. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2591.8s)]
*  They believed in radical self-reliance and that they determined their fate. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2593.32s)]
*  And then over time, we've solely looked at the government as the determinant of our [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2598.36s)]
*  fate. And what handout, what tax break for the rich, what can I get? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2602.36s)]
*  What edge can I get on the system? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2608.96s)]
*  What angle shot? How can I look at the government as a solution to our problems? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2611.08s)]
*  And what I think all sides of the political spectrum need to look at and celebrate. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2615.7200000000003s)]
*  And this is why I think Chris Christie and Vivek are like really good candidates is [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2620.84s)]
*  because they're not looking at handouts or blaming the government or looking to the [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2625.28s)]
*  government to solve problems, but looking at your community, looking inside yourself [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2629.5600000000004s)]
*  and saying, hey, what are the ways in which if I want to, if I want to move up those [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2632.84s)]
*  strata? And remember, some people work to live. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2638.6000000000004s)]
*  They don't live to work. They just want to do their nine to five, put their time in [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2641.2400000000002s)]
*  and spend time with their families or do their art, whatever their job does not define [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2644.6000000000004s)]
*  them. And we are a biased group of entrepreneurs who are defined ourselves in large [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2648.24s)]
*  part by what we do in our work. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2653.4799999999996s)]
*  Doesn't mean we don't care about our families, but we put that front and center. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2655.4399999999996s)]
*  Some people don't want to move up the lines. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2658.7999999999997s)]
*  They're happy and content where they are. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2660.3199999999997s)]
*  But the entire dialogue in America is about how unfair we split that tax base. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2662.7599999999998s)]
*  As you talk about, Freeburg, the spending and everybody wanting their piece and [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2668.8799999999997s)]
*  everybody wondering who got a bigger piece of the pie as opposed to wondering, hey, how [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2671.8799999999997s)]
*  can I improve myself? How can I provide more value to the world? [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2676.16s)]
*  How can I build a business? How can I build a skill set? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2679.3599999999997s)]
*  And that's where the dialogue needs to move. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2681.92s)]
*  And I just when I hear Vivek speak, you know, I disagree with him about a lot of things. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2683.68s)]
*  I hear Chris Christie speak. I obviously disagree with him about a couple of issues. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2688.04s)]
*  But I'm liking those candidates and I'm liking the direction they're going. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2691.7599999999998s)]
*  Vivek has a great line, which is victimization as a choice. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2695.08s)]
*  And you see different versions of it on both the right and the left. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2698.0s)]
*  On the left, the victimization is based on identity politics, where if you're born into a certain [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2702.2799999999997s)]
*  group, then you're automatically a victim, regardless of really your circumstances. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2707.2s)]
*  On the right, it's more again, it's it's more of this populist critique where if you're a [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2712.12s)]
*  working class person, then you've been victimized by those policies. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2716.2799999999997s)]
*  I think there's some degree of truth in both critiques. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2719.48s)]
*  I mean, I do think that policymakers have to meet people halfway. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2722.64s)]
*  We need to have policies that work better for working class. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2726.64s)]
*  We need to have policies that prevent discrimination. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2730.44s)]
*  At the same time, people can't just buy into this victimhood mentality where they're like, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2733.76s)]
*  OK, I don't need to do anything on my own to improve my circumstances. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2738.88s)]
*  The whole system is still rigged against me. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2742.36s)]
*  I don't need to take any agency for my own actions. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2744.28s)]
*  Also, and I think it needs to be both. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2746.8s)]
*  We have to have policymakers and people meet halfway on this. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2748.56s)]
*  I also think that there's. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2751.96s)]
*  A social dynamic that's also worth exploring here, which is that we live in a culture. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2754.0s)]
*  Where. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2759.16s)]
*  A lot of people spend a lot of time. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2761.4799999999996s)]
*  Projecting a version of themselves. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2764.9599999999996s)]
*  And that version of themselves is mostly meant to accrue social capital to them. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2768.16s)]
*  But by implication, it's to make other people feel envious of them as well. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2774.7999999999997s)]
*  And that's the whole, they'll call it the Instagram phenomenon. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2779.7999999999997s)]
*  And I also think, I just think it's important to acknowledge that we live in a point where [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2783.7599999999998s)]
*  there's this heightened. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2787.64s)]
*  Psychological sensation that everybody else is doing better than you are. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2790.04s)]
*  And so you have to find these mechanisms of rationalizing and explaining. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2795.2s)]
*  And I think that that's also very dangerous. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2800.24s)]
*  So Jason, to your point, there is so much respect. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2802.16s)]
*  You know, a lot of the reason why I spend so much time in Italy is my friends here. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2804.96s)]
*  Are just very, very simple. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2809.12s)]
*  You guys met so many of them, just normal, everyday people. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2810.72s)]
*  And. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2814.44s)]
*  And they're happy. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2815.52s)]
*  And I have so much respect for that because they have a balance in their life. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2816.48s)]
*  And one of the things that defines them is they don't spend time. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2822.16s)]
*  In these media formats that actually exacerbate the sense of being [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2826.6s)]
*  less than everybody else. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2831.48s)]
*  And I find that to be a consistent thread amongst all of these people that are [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2834.2s)]
*  really well balanced at every strata of whatever line you're on. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2838.52s)]
*  The healthiest people in each of those lines are the ones that actually have a [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2843.44s)]
*  definition of themselves that comes from within that is multifaceted. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2847.88s)]
*  That generally includes a deep relationship with one romantic partner. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2853.0400000000004s)]
*  And it includes their kids. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2857.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2860.1600000000003s)]
*  Everything else is very much secondary. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2860.44s)]
*  And it's not defined by where you want to go and where you want to be. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2862.6800000000003s)]
*  It's defined by the day you're living. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2866.76s)]
*  I had a great conversation after a lot of wine and tequila and beer. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2869.4s)]
*  And I don't know what else, uh, at the wedding, actually forgot the guy's name. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2874.6800000000003s)]
*  So with Drake, I said to the guy, this Italian guys, I'm sorry, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2879.08s)]
*  forgot his name, really nice guy. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2883.04s)]
*  And we were talking about the difference between Americans and Italians and how [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2885.28s)]
*  the Italians are all about, let's just live for today. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2889.84s)]
*  Enjoy our moment, enjoy our experience, enjoy our time. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2892.6s)]
*  The Americans all just want to talk about where things are going, where we're [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2896.04s)]
*  headed, what we're looking for, what we're trying to achieve. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2898.88s)]
*  And so much about it's the irony is I've got my brother visiting from Europe this [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2902.56s)]
*  week and so much of the conversation. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2905.92s)]
*  Difference that we've talked about is in America, we talk about winning. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2909.4s)]
*  It's like everything is a, everything is a contest. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2913.2400000000002s)]
*  Everything is about getting ahead. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2915.48s)]
*  Everything is about a challenge. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2916.56s)]
*  Everything is about what's next. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2918.28s)]
*  How do I get to the next level scorecard and that's what's made us the greatest [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2920.04s)]
*  entrepreneurial, you know, society, the greatest 250 years of progress in human [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2924.04s)]
*  history is that I disagree with that. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2928.52s)]
*  I disagree with that, but it also makes you profoundly sad. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2930.7599999999998s)]
*  If you only live for the scorecard and not the game, I don't think entrepreneurs [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2934.16s)]
*  have a scorecard. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2937.36s)]
*  I don't think they're looking at somebody else saying, I'm going to beat that guy. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2938.12s)]
*  I don't think that that's where it comes from. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2940.84s)]
*  Forget about the term score. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2942.88s)]
*  Forget about competition. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2943.96s)]
*  Just make it about progress. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2945.0s)]
*  Where am I going? [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2946.6s)]
*  And that we orient ourselves around where we headed versus where are we today? [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2947.92s)]
*  You know, just enjoying this moment that you have today, the moment. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2951.68s)]
*  And I think that there's a big cultural difference between the U S and the guy I [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2954.56s)]
*  was sitting next to at your wedding. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2958.24s)]
*  Chabot, these folks are just very much about enjoying this experience and not [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2959.2799999999997s)]
*  thinking about what's next and where we're going. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2964.2s)]
*  We come in, everyone saunters around. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2966.12s)]
*  No one's thinking about what time we have to start. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2968.24s)]
*  Everyone's just enjoying their time with each other and the Americans are all [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2970.8399999999997s)]
*  like, when are we starting the wedding? [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2973.7999999999997s)]
*  When are we doing this? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2975.04s)]
*  When are we doing that? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2975.72s)]
*  You know, litmus test for that I find is when you first meet somebody. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2976.64s)]
*  And I encourage all of you guys to try to do this is to not go to what do you do? [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2981.3999999999996s)]
*  As the question, right? [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2988.68s)]
*  American how long can you go without asking that question? [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2990.2s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2994.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2996.16s)]
*  And I find it's so amazing to actually have conversations with people where [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=2996.3599999999997s)]
*  that question never comes up. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3002.3599999999997s)]
*  You will really, really, really learn a lot about people. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3006.4799999999996s)]
*  I think a lot of this also is like, you know, I was watching the center Tim Scott. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3009.4399999999996s)]
*  I'd love to have him on the program. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3014.2799999999997s)]
*  I know he's maybe not got the highest percentage right now. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3016.2s)]
*  And we got a bunch of other candidates coming on the program, by the way, for the [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3018.96s)]
*  audience, but I was just taken back by I saw Joy Behar or whatever the host of [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3021.92s)]
*  the view is, Joy Behar and she was just admonishing him that he doesn't [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3028.3599999999997s)]
*  understand systematic racism. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3035.16s)]
*  He's a black man. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3038.16s)]
*  And he's like, I am the product of the American system. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3039.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm proud of where I got to. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3042.92s)]
*  And she was, you know, she's constantly trying to make him feel worse that the, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3044.88s)]
*  the, you know, the conditions are terrible. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3050.04s)]
*  It's funny because like, it was a very weird disjoint, somebody basically saying [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3052.64s)]
*  that Tim Scott is not allowed to be proud of his journey. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3056.92s)]
*  Basically. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3059.84s)]
*  That's what she did. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3060.48s)]
*  Why? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3061.2000000000003s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3062.56s)]
*  It just take the win. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3063.88s)]
*  Like just let him, you know, yeah, it's, it's really weird. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3064.76s)]
*  And, uh, I just want to take one other moment from the song because this song [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3068.44s)]
*  got pegged as like, maybe it's propaganda. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3073.24s)]
*  I don't know if it is maybe this guy that people started doing there. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3075.3199999999997s)]
*  Like, how do we take this guy down? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3078.8399999999997s)]
*  Like the left and the right lunatics, uh, you know, on the fringe always try to do [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3080.92s)]
*  something happens, that's nice or, you know, whatever, we got to take the person [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3084.92s)]
*  down and maybe the guy is a lunatic. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3088.2799999999997s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3090.2799999999997s)]
*  He's just an artist to me, but he liked, or had a playlist of nine, 11 conspiracy [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3090.7599999999998s)]
*  theories, but he says here in the song, Lord, we got folks in the street. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3095.68s)]
*  Ain't got nothing to eat. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3099.2s)]
*  And the obese milk and welfare will God, if you're five foot three and you're 300 [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3101.2799999999997s)]
*  pounds, taxes ought not to pay for your bags of fun fudge rounds. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3106.24s)]
*  Talk about the welfare state. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3112.32s)]
*  Young men are putting themselves six feet in the ground. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3113.36s)]
*  Cause all this country does is keep kicking them down. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3116.64s)]
*  Referencing, I think, you know, Jordan Peterson and the suicide rate amongst young [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3119.84s)]
*  men and their hopelessness and, you know, et cetera. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3124.72s)]
*  And it's very hard. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3127.9199999999996s)]
*  I think I would encourage people to be careful trying to pin this as a left or a [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3129.72s)]
*  right song. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3132.8799999999997s)]
*  This is about, you know, working class people feeling frustrated with the system [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3134.04s)]
*  is was my read on it. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3138.3199999999997s)]
*  And, uh, maybe even fighting back and taking a little bit, a bit of their power, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3141.64s)]
*  but a great song. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3146.12s)]
*  Congratulations to him. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3147.24s)]
*  And I hope he writes some more tunes reminded me of pick a song like the river [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3148.72s)]
*  by Bruce Springsteen or telegraph road by dire straights. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3153.52s)]
*  Just so many great songs about the working man. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3157.12s)]
*  Congratulations on hitting number one and everybody else can tear it down. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3160.2s)]
*  And in the comments, you can tell us we're out of touch, even though we moved up [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3163.32s)]
*  the lines. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3166.4s)]
*  I think that's by the way, why some people like the show and, you know, have is [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3167.12s)]
*  because maybe we did move up a couple of lines and maybe we might have a [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3171.7599999999998s)]
*  perspective at some point in, you know, how to do that. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3174.84s)]
*  Let's move on. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3178.44s)]
*  I guess. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3179.28s)]
*  I think everybody got their shot at this. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3179.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3181.28s)]
*  The big short to Michael Burry. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3181.6s)]
*  He just made a bet against the markets. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3184.7999999999997s)]
*  This was trending. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3187.36s)]
*  I'm not sure how much of this is all true, but there's been some reporting on it. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3188.2s)]
*  Burry's fun has recently bought 866 million and put options against the S and P [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3192.6s)]
*  and 739 million puts against the NASDAQ. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3199.2s)]
*  Uh, these are headline numbers on the sec. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3203.64s)]
*  There's probably more to it. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3205.48s)]
*  Contacts. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3206.92s)]
*  Obviously we all know the markets ripped NASDAQ up 37% this year. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3207.48s)]
*  S and P up 15% this year. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3211.16s)]
*  Inflation getting cracked. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3212.7999999999997s)]
*  GDP looking strong. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3214.68s)]
*  Unemployment on the floor. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3217.64s)]
*  Number of job openings still above 9.x million. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3219.2799999999997s)]
*  Pretty crazy to think about how resilient this economy is with pockets of [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3224.12s)]
*  disastrous stuff, but what's your take on this free bird? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3227.48s)]
*  Yeah, I think the reporting is a little wrong on this. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3230.0s)]
*  So this came out of a 13 F filing and on the 13 F filing you, when you report [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3232.48s)]
*  option contracts, remember each option contract represents a hundred underlying [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3238.4s)]
*  shares and you don't have to talk about the strike or the expiry on the option [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3243.04s)]
*  contract when you do the 13 F filing. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3249.08s)]
*  So we don't actually know what the strike or the expiry is on the option. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3250.6s)]
*  That dollar amount that's being reported is when they take the number of option [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3255.2000000000003s)]
*  contracts, multiply it by a hundred, which is how many shares per contract, and then [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3259.1600000000003s)]
*  just use the price on the actual underlying the index, he may have paid a dollar in [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3263.76s)]
*  option. He may have bought an option that was three years out of the way out of [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3267.24s)]
*  the money. It could be much smaller. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3270.6s)]
*  It could be a short term contract. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3273.4799999999996s)]
*  That's just a near term hedge on the portfolio. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3274.8399999999997s)]
*  And we have no idea how much, which of the actual dollar value of the contract is. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3276.8399999999997s)]
*  It could be really way out. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3280.3999999999996s)]
*  It could just be a short term hedge. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3282.52s)]
*  So we really don't know directionally or magnitudinally how significant this is. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3284.52s)]
*  So it's a bit of a misreporting without knowing the strike and the expiry. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3290.52s)]
*  We don't know how much he actually spent buying these puts and what the bet really [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3294.6400000000003s)]
*  means. Is it a near term bet or long term? [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3298.7200000000003s)]
*  And what percentage of his portfolio? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3300.28s)]
*  Right. You don't have to disclose in a 13 F what your short positions are. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3302.2000000000003s)]
*  And so all you have to do is disclose what your ownership is. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3307.6400000000003s)]
*  So my suspicion is that Michael probably has what's called a short straddle on. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3311.76s)]
*  And so a short straddle is when you're basically selling a call and you're buying a [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3316.4s)]
*  put. And so, you know, we've talked about these a lot, which is instead of taking a [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3320.4s)]
*  naked exposure for one point six billion dollars, which seems very. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3324.7200000000003s)]
*  Aggressive and risk on and he's not the type of guy, if you look at his trading [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3329.32s)]
*  activity that does that kind of stuff, his typical positions are 50 basis points, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3332.52s)]
*  80 basis points, 100 basis points. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3336.6s)]
*  So he's not a big risk taker. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3338.92s)]
*  So what he probably has on is what's called the short straddle. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3340.2000000000003s)]
*  And what you don't have to disclose in these 13 Fs is the other side of the trade [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3343.0s)]
*  where you're sure to call. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3348.52s)]
*  And so I suspect that's what that is. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3350.56s)]
*  So this is a big much ado about nothing. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3351.88s)]
*  It's good headlines in a moment where there's not much to talk about. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3353.88s)]
*  It's August and the media, you know, this is the media business losing its business [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3358.7200000000003s)]
*  model and Google and Facebook taking all their revenue and Craigslist and Facebook, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3363.92s)]
*  you know, marketplace taking all their. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3368.0s)]
*  And Michael, by the way, Michael, go on Twitter and tell us that we're wrong. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3369.7200000000003s)]
*  But I'm sure dollars to doughnuts. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3372.36s)]
*  He's got a short straddle. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3374.12s)]
*  Didn't he go off Twitter? [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3374.96s)]
*  He's like done with Twitter. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3376.2400000000002s)]
*  He goes on and off and he auto deletes his tweets. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3377.1600000000003s)]
*  So I said a zappier up anytime he tweets, it puts it in a slack room for me. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3379.44s)]
*  Have you guys noticed the quantity of wine I'm drinking? [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3383.2000000000003s)]
*  This is my last three years. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3385.48s)]
*  Oh, you got ice cubes in that. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3388.7200000000003s)]
*  No, but let me just say this. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3390.64s)]
*  Look, I'm I'm back in the United States next week. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3391.76s)]
*  So this is the end of the vacation. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3394.56s)]
*  The end of the year. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3396.36s)]
*  It's end of a one month where I don't exercise except for swimming and walking. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3397.64s)]
*  I eat gelato every day and I drink wine every day. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3402.12s)]
*  So this is the end. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3404.8s)]

*  Sorry. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3513.0s)]
*  I think we should follow up on where the economy is right now and what the macro [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3513.44s)]
*  situation is like and why Michael Berry might want to short the market. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3516.9199999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3521.16s)]
*  So in terms of where things stand today, I think the consensus view of the street [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3521.68s)]
*  is that inflation is largely in the rear view mirror. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3528.04s)]
*  It was down to 3% last month. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3531.12s)]
*  And the bet now, I think, is that it will continue to remain low. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3533.2799999999997s)]
*  It will be in this two and a half to 3% range at the end of the year. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3538.64s)]
*  And therefore the Fed will be able to cut rates next year. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3541.72s)]
*  And the market has rallied quite a bit in anticipation of that. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3545.64s)]
*  I think that is the consensus view. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3548.4s)]
*  I think there are at least two really big risk factors to that. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3550.08s)]
*  One is that inflation could still rebound. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3553.64s)]
*  We haven't really gotten that many months of good inflation data. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3555.8399999999997s)]
*  And if inflation ticks back up, if there's another wave of it in the next several months, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3559.3999999999996s)]
*  then there will not be rate cuts next year. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3564.9199999999996s)]
*  And that means if its rates are higher than anticipated, valuations come down. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3566.56s)]
*  So that would be a big risk factor to the market. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3571.64s)]
*  The other big risk factor is, I think, in the real economy. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3573.44s)]
*  It's true that the economy does not seem to be hurt so far by these huge interest rate [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3577.16s)]
*  hikes that we've had. However, there is typically a big lag in the impact on the real [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3583.16s)]
*  economy of rate hikes. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3588.56s)]
*  And I think you could still see these rate hikes take effect over the next several months. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3590.3999999999996s)]
*  And you could see a real dip in the economy, potentially a recession. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3595.68s)]
*  And that would be a big risk factor to the markets, because right now the markets are [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3600.3199999999997s)]
*  pricing in a soft landing or no landing. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3604.36s)]
*  They're pricing at the economy. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3607.0800000000004s)]
*  We're just going to do a flyby. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3607.84s)]
*  Right. Right. So what is the evidence that there might be a lag? [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3609.1600000000003s)]
*  Well, a couple of things. And it really has to do with real estate, which I think is the [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3612.28s)]
*  most impacted asset class by rate hikes. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3616.0800000000004s)]
*  You saw that the mortgage rate is the highest it's been in over 20 years. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3618.8s)]
*  Yeah, since the 90s. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3623.88s)]
*  Seven point nine percent. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3625.0s)]
*  And the rates I'm seeing in Florida and other places, mortgages are like eight percent. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3626.92s)]
*  Well, if it's going to cost you eight percent to buy a new house and it used to be three [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3631.8s)]
*  percent a couple of years ago, you're not going to be able to afford to buy that same [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3636.88s)]
*  level of house. And you can't afford to sell your current house and buy a new one because [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3640.6800000000003s)]
*  your current house is financed at three percent. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3645.32s)]
*  You're not going to give up that mortgage to trade into an eight percent mortgage. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3647.4s)]
*  So we're already seeing a huge reduction in the number of transactions in residential [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3650.56s)]
*  real estate. And so that means that we're not seeing a lot of fresh marks in terms of [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3657.2s)]
*  where prices are. But that doesn't mean the valuations haven't gone lower. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3662.72s)]
*  I think that as this washes through the system, you could see a big correction in the values [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3666.52s)]
*  of residential real estate, which is most people's main asset. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3671.44s)]
*  So I think there's a big risk factor there. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3674.8799999999997s)]
*  The other big risk factor is on the commercial real estate side. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3676.3999999999996s)]
*  There was an interesting article in The Wall Street Journal about distress funds are forming [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3679.96s)]
*  in anticipation of a lot of commercial real estate projects basically going under. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3684.84s)]
*  So the vultures on Wall Street are going to be looking to scoop up these projects. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3690.96s)]
*  I think the really interesting thing about commercial real estate right now is multifamily. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3696.04s)]
*  Until now, the conversation has all been about office space. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3701.2400000000002s)]
*  And we know that office space is impaired because of the high vacancy rates that this [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3704.8s)]
*  the sector just hasn't come back the same way since covid. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3709.64s)]
*  Right. Exactly. But now we're starting to see real distress in the multifamily sector. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3712.72s)]
*  Now, why has this happened? [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3718.7599999999998s)]
*  Because multifamily is full. There's no vacancy problem. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3720.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard to get a home and more people would be renting if mortgages are high. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3723.56s)]
*  So the problem is not on the demand side. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3727.44s)]
*  The problem is in the capital stack. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3729.24s)]
*  So let me describe the problem of what's happened here is let's say that you are a real [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3730.68s)]
*  estate developer who bought multifamily. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3736.52s)]
*  You bought it at a certain price level. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3739.8799999999997s)]
*  Let's say you finance it two thirds with debt. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3741.36s)]
*  You now need to go out and refinance that project because let's say you did a value [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3744.56s)]
*  add, let's say you basically did some improvements to it. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3748.88s)]
*  That means you didn't put long term debt on it. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3751.44s)]
*  You can't put long term debt on a project that's not stabilized yet. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3753.84s)]
*  If you want to do value add work to it, you get what's called a construction loan for [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3756.44s)]
*  two or three years. So there's a lot of real estate developers who need to go out right [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3759.76s)]
*  now and finance these projects that they bought. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3764.08s)]
*  And they bought these projects at the top of the market. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3767.2400000000002s)]
*  So let's say you're going out now to refinance. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3769.6s)]
*  First of all, the rates are much higher. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3772.56s)]
*  You're looking at paying eight or nine percent instead of the three to four percent that [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3774.88s)]
*  you had penciled in your model a couple of years ago. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3780.4s)]
*  Moreover, there's another problem, which is potentially even worse, which is loan to value. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3782.72s)]
*  You had basically gotten two thirds loan to value a couple of years ago, but values are [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3787.8399999999997s)]
*  much higher. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3792.88s)]
*  Now values are lower because, again, multiples have shrunk as interest rates have gone up. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3793.84s)]
*  And so the amount that you can finance is much lower. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3800.7200000000003s)]
*  So you either have to top that off by coming out of pocket with your own equity or you [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3803.84s)]
*  have to go to one of these mezzanine funds. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3808.1600000000003s)]
*  So now there's these mezz funds. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3810.1600000000003s)]
*  They are total sharks and they're going to charge you not eight or nine percent, but [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3811.76s)]
*  like 15 percent. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3815.28s)]
*  So your capital stack has basically is completely upside down. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3816.6400000000003s)]
*  You thought that you could borrow all this money really cheaply, but now it is super [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3820.96s)]
*  expensive and this project no longer pencils, meaning you're underwater from you got [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3825.2s)]
*  negative leverage on the project. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3830.96s)]
*  And so I think you're going to see again, not just impaired office space, now impaired [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3832.32s)]
*  multifamily. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3836.7200000000003s)]
*  And there is not, I think, a sector of real estate developer who is not in distress right [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3838.08s)]
*  now if they need financing in the next year or two. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3843.28s)]
*  That's what you get. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3845.68s)]
*  You get a rate from hash. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3847.12s)]
*  David, David, what do you do? [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3848.7999999999997s)]
*  What do you do if you're long? [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3850.0s)]
*  These assets, do you just default on them and just give them back to the bank? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3851.3599999999997s)]
*  One major real estate guy told me that the big guys like, you know, Blackstone, the words [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3854.8799999999997s)]
*  he used was they are throwing their keys at the bank, meaning they are so underwater, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3861.04s)]
*  they're not even going to bother trying to figure out a workout. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3867.12s)]
*  They're just going to give the key. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3870.3999999999996s)]
*  They're just going to say to the bank, you own this asset now, and they're going to move [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3871.3599999999997s)]
*  on to the next fund. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3874.0s)]
*  There's actually his take at least that was you said you sent a tweet to the group chat [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3874.96s)]
*  about the last line of like hope, which was called a hope note, which is like where one [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3878.2400000000002s)]
*  of these Mez financiers just takes your property. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3883.68s)]
*  And then if they happen to hit your high watermark again later on, that you would get that you [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3886.7200000000003s)]
*  would get some, you know, idiot insurance and get a little taste of the sale. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3892.96s)]
*  Shomop, you had a tweet about the housing. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3896.7200000000003s)]
*  What's your take? [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3898.88s)]
*  Well, no, my only thought around housing was that very much just supporting what Sachs [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3899.92s)]
*  just said, like we're in an incredibly untenable situation, mostly because as rates go up, [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3904.48s)]
*  mortgage applications go down. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3910.0s)]
*  And so what you're seeing is just like the number of people trying to transact is very [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3911.52s)]
*  small. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3916.16s)]
*  And so the inventory is very small. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3916.64s)]
*  And so Sachs said well, so I don't really have much to add except that when you think [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3918.8s)]
*  about where this lands squarely in terms of the wealth creation that it's supposed to [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3924.32s)]
*  represent for most Americans, it's a very difficult situation. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3930.08s)]
*  It's frozen. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3934.88s)]
*  This is, I actually think the people talk about the political pressure from the White [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3935.6s)]
*  House to the Fed. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3940.64s)]
*  And I think that this actually is probably a very powerful lens with which to look at [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3942.4s)]
*  it. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3948.48s)]
*  And the reason is because this touches all voters in every state across all political [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3949.04s)]
*  lines. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3955.84s)]
*  And I think when people talk about is the economy doing well or is the economy not doing [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3956.64s)]
*  well? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3960.56s)]
*  And as a result, where are your political leanings? [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3961.04s)]
*  I think something like this actually represents a much larger percentage of how people [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3964.72s)]
*  represent whether they feel they're doing well than any other thing. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3968.7999999999997s)]
*  Even earnings, quite honestly, because I think that a home is just such a fundamentally [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3972.24s)]
*  visceral psychological component of safety. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3976.64s)]
*  And a percentage, a large percentage are well, and 60% of people own one. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3979.7599999999998s)]
*  And the people who own one are the people who vote. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3984.56s)]
*  So it may only be 60% of people, but it might be 80% of voters. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3986.64s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3989.92s)]
*  I think that could probably be very well be true. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3991.12s)]
*  So my only point in that was just more that this could actually, if the Fed is susceptible [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=3993.36s)]
*  to political pressure, I think this is the kind of thing that pressures them to move [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4001.2799999999997s)]
*  forward, the point at which they start cutting and just start to let go of the release valve, [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4005.36s)]
*  just because there's just too much pressure in the system. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4010.16s)]
*  Yeah, there's talk of them doing a safety rate hike, doing another 25 bips at the end [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4013.52s)]
*  of the year just to be safe. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4020.08s)]
*  And I think one of the things we've learned here is- [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4021.52s)]
*  I don't think the data really supports that, to be honest with you. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4024.16s)]
*  But they've made poor decisions this whole time. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4026.88s)]
*  And this is not like the Fed's impact with this tool is not like driving a car where [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4029.6s)]
*  you hit the accelerator, you hit the brake, and you get an immediate reaction. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4036.0s)]
*  This is more like driving a train where it takes a little while to get up to [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4039.2799999999997s)]
*  speed. And if you slam on the brakes, this thing can come off the rails. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4042.4s)]
*  And that's the scary part for me. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4046.1600000000003s)]
*  Just to build on what Sac said, the most interesting thing about this for me [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4047.76s)]
*  is that typically we think about the Fed as being very silent in election years. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4052.8s)]
*  They really don't try to get that involved, mostly because they don't want to seem like [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4056.96s)]
*  they're tipping in an election one way or the other. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4060.64s)]
*  The problem that we have is that rates are at a near term high. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4063.04s)]
*  The tenure is ratcheting up faster than we ever expected. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4067.6s)]
*  It's rallied in terms of rates, meaningfully more than anybody thought [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4072.4s)]
*  since the beginning of the year. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4076.48s)]
*  And so now we're in this odd position where will the Fed cut? [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4078.08s)]
*  And why will they cut? [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4083.36s)]
*  And if they cut, will they cut sooner than they would have? [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4085.36s)]
*  If they hold on, is it that they just want the country to enter a recession, [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4087.92s)]
*  in which case they want to see quote unquote regime change? [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4092.64s)]
*  It's a very interesting set of financial and political politics [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4095.36s)]
*  that I don't think we've seen in recent years. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4099.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, well, there's a lot of real estate developers who are literally hanging on [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4101.84s)]
*  by their fingernails and they're hoping and praying for a rate cut. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4106.16s)]
*  The problem they're going to have is that even if inflation doesn't rebound, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4110.24s)]
*  even if the Fed does cut rates next year, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4114.320000000001s)]
*  the rate that the Fed cuts is the short rate. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4117.4400000000005s)]
*  It's basically the Fed funds rate. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4119.84s)]
*  That's at five and a half percent right now. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4121.2s)]
*  Even if they cut that to call it three to four percent next year, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4123.12s)]
*  there's no guarantee that the 10-year rate, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4126.5599999999995s)]
*  which is what real estate developers get financed on, will move down. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4128.88s)]
*  The 10-year rate is what is it now at like 4.5% or something like that. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4133.28s)]
*  And that rate may not come down. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4138.24s)]
*  A lot of economists are worrying about this. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4139.68s)]
*  Larry Summers warned about this because the federal government [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4141.44s)]
*  has such huge financing needs. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4143.92s)]
*  And so just because short rates come down, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4146.24s)]
*  there's no guarantee that the long rates are going to come down. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4148.16s)]
*  So there may not be this relief that real estate developers are looking for next year. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4150.24s)]
*  And again, there's this wall of debt that has to be refinanced. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4154.5599999999995s)]
*  I'll give you an example from my own portfolio. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4157.36s)]
*  I have a building, just to simplify. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4159.28s)]
*  You've got a couple of buildings, but okay. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4161.04s)]
*  Yeah, I've got a building that's worth about $15 million. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4163.44s)]
*  It's an office building, okay? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4165.92s)]
*  There's a $9 million loan on it that is coming up to be refinanced at the end of the year. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4167.12s)]
*  So I'm talking to the lender about rolling it over. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4171.36s)]
*  And what they agreed to do, here are the terms. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4174.48s)]
*  They agreed to give me $2.4 million out of the nine secured by the building. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4178.8s)]
*  That's it. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4184.0s)]
*  They wouldn't roll over the nine. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4185.12s)]
*  They'd only give me $2.4. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4186.24s)]
*  For the other $6.6, they wanted me to post additional collateral [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4187.76s)]
*  in the form of public securities. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4192.08s)]
*  So they basically wanted me to fully collateralize the loan. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4194.0s)]
*  So in other words, they're adding a margin account on top of commercial real estate loans. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4196.72s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4202.24s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4202.88s)]
*  So they want me to over-collateralize the building with a bunch of securities. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4203.6s)]
*  Why do you need a loan from them? [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4206.72s)]
*  It's not a real estate loan. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4208.240000000001s)]
*  It's not a real estate loan. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4209.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4210.4800000000005s)]
*  And they want me to personally guarantee it. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4211.280000000001s)]
*  So why don't you just sell the shares and buy the nine? [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4212.96s)]
*  You just sold a participating preferred in your building. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4217.120000000001s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4221.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4222.080000000001s)]
*  No, he took out a margin loan on his own security portfolio. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4222.64s)]
*  So what I said is, listen, I don't need this loan. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4225.6s)]
*  I'm just going to pay it off. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4227.280000000001s)]
*  So I'm going to pay off 100% of the loan. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4228.160000000001s)]
*  And I'll just own the building 100%. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4230.400000000001s)]
*  And when this credit crunch is over, whether it's next year or two years from now, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4232.080000000001s)]
*  I'll just refi it then. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4236.16s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4237.68s)]
*  The average developer can't do that. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4238.4s)]
*  How do they go out and get that extra $9 million? [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4240.0s)]
*  Well, Zach, let's just point out the opportunity cost to you. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4241.84s)]
*  You could buy treasuries that pay you 5.5%. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4244.24s)]
*  So your actual cost on that capital that you're using to finance the building yourself [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4246.88s)]
*  to buy the debt is costing you 5.5% a year of risk-free income for the $9 million. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4251.12s)]
*  It's not a pleasant situation. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4259.68s)]
*  It's something that I can manage through. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4261.12s)]
*  But my point is that this is something that's going to be afflicting pretty much every real [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4263.44s)]
*  estate developer needs to refinance in the next year or so. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4267.36s)]
*  And they don't have what you have, which is the balance sheet to be able to do that. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4269.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4273.28s)]
*  They don't have the chip stack. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4273.839999999999s)]
*  And by the way, my real estate guys tell me that this deal that I got offered is a good deal right [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4275.44s)]
*  now. It's a good deal because at least they were trying to be flexible and work with me. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4279.599999999999s)]
*  Most of these lenders, they're just not even open for business. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4285.36s)]
*  I heard there's just no bid. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4287.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, these guys I know that work in commercial real estate debt said [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4288.719999999999s)]
*  they're putting out these syndicated loan proposals to the typical funders and there's no bid. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4293.04s)]
*  They're like, well, just tell me the rate. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4298.8s)]
*  They're like, there is no rate. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4300.400000000001s)]
*  There's just no bid. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4301.28s)]
*  Well, interesting news. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4302.0s)]
*  We've been talking a little bit about these bond offerings, et cetera. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4303.92s)]
*  And the US is, with the higher yield, still continuing to draw buyers. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4308.56s)]
*  Japan, very soft in terms of getting people to buy their securities and $127 billion. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4315.4400000000005s)]
*  The share into funds that invest in treasury is on pace for a record year. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4322.48s)]
*  Bank America Corp said last week. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4326.48s)]
*  All right, let's move on to we got Nvidia left on the docket. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4329.36s)]
*  We got Hoppin as a peak Zerp. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4333.5199999999995s)]
*  The founder sold out a lot of shares. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4336.639999999999s)]
*  Let's pick one of these stories. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4338.24s)]
*  Or we got the SBA, which is going to be big drama next year when this goes to court. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4340.0s)]
*  Or Saks, we could go. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4344.5599999999995s)]
*  Those are the stories. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4348.959999999999s)]
*  There's not a lot of meat on them. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4349.679999999999s)]
*  I think let's just spend five. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4350.719999999999s)]
*  Should we do the indictment? [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4352.160000000001s)]
*  Giving you your red meat. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4353.68s)]
*  Oh, me giving me my red meat? [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4354.8s)]
*  I think five minutes of you ranting and doing your TDS and then we can wrap. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4356.4800000000005s)]
*  All right. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4360.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, listen, I don't want to speak to your TSS, your Trump Stockholm Syndrome. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4360.72s)]
*  But I will say that Trump, yes, has his fourth indictment. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4365.76s)]
*  You thought the hat trick was a lot. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4370.08s)]
*  Well, now he's got four. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4371.280000000001s)]
*  Fulton County, Georgia, 13 felony counts. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4374.64s)]
*  But this one's incredible. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4377.360000000001s)]
*  It's got a lot of co-conspirators. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4378.4800000000005s)]
*  And all I'll say is there is a small town in Georgia. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4380.56s)]
*  Coffee is I think the name of it. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4387.68s)]
*  And there were a bunch of election machines and a group of this whack pack went in there [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4390.080000000001s)]
*  and committed a bunch of cyber crimes accordingly. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4394.96s)]
*  And it's not clear yet. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4397.280000000001s)]
*  But when this thing goes to trial, just keep an eye on that. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4398.72s)]
*  There's an incredible lawfare article and we'll put it in the show notes and a podcast. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4401.92s)]
*  But I think that opening up the aperture of it is what's really interesting to me. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4407.12s)]
*  What I'm seeing is I think there's a lot of viable, moderate Republican candidates [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4412.32s)]
*  that would appeal to somebody like me. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4417.36s)]
*  I have voted 25% Republican, 75% a Democrat. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4419.12s)]
*  I'm a moderate, but left leaning moderate, I would say, on social issues, on fiscal issues. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4422.96s)]
*  I'm definitely in the Republican camp. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4428.48s)]
*  But I'm looking at Christie. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4430.0s)]
*  I'm looking at Vivek. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4431.12s)]
*  I'm looking at a lot of those kind of Republicans, even Tim Scott, and saying, you know what? [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4432.72s)]
*  Maybe that's a better choice than Biden, who is very senile. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4436.88s)]
*  And I think the Republican Party has its moment right now to disassociate itself and say enough [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4440.64s)]
*  with the Meshugana, enough of Trump. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4448.72s)]
*  And you're starting to see Pence come out very strongly, Sax. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4450.96s)]
*  Vivek is still bootlicking, I think, and is still like trying to get the VP spot with Trump. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4455.04s)]
*  I think it's a huge mistake. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4459.76s)]
*  And I think, Christie, and maybe it's time for your guy, DeSantis, who is in the pardon camp [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4461.68s)]
*  as well, but maybe it's time for him to, you know, maybe start criticizing him. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4468.64s)]
*  And then I think it's time to negotiate a pardon for both Trump and Hunter Biden. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4471.92s)]
*  Pardon both of them, get them out of political life, and let's move on as a country. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4478.0s)]
*  I believe that you're going to see Chris Christie and Vivek surge. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4482.56s)]
*  It's going to be a three-horse race with DeSantis. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4488.16s)]
*  And I think Trump's going to be out of the race in the next six to 12 months. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4490.0s)]
*  That's just my prediction. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4493.52s)]
*  Your thoughts, Sax? [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4494.32s)]
*  Well, I want to give you a chance here to expound on your blue meat. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4496.24s)]
*  Not red meat. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4500.72s)]
*  For you, it's blue meat. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4501.44s)]
*  Blue meat. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4502.16s)]
*  Your TDS is flaring up again, Jason. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4503.36s)]
*  I think it's amusing. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4505.12s)]
*  No, no. No TDS. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4506.24s)]
*  So let me ask you to expound on this pardon theory because you claim that you think that [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4507.2s)]
*  Trump is now playing for a pardon. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4511.36s)]
*  I think he's playing for a pardon, yes. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4513.04s)]
*  Can you explain that? [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4516.0s)]
*  How do you get from here to there? [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4517.04s)]
*  I think he is going to go buck wild. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4518.08s)]
*  He is lashing out, et cetera, in the hopes that he can cause so much chaos because you're seeing [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4521.92s)]
*  him with these tweets that are kind of borderlining on violence and inciting people, gag orders, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4528.5599999999995s)]
*  that kind of stuff. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4535.92s)]
*  I think he's going to keep pushing the envelope to the point at which he breaks the Republican [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4536.64s)]
*  party, makes Americans really burnt out because the Republicans can't win with him. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4541.84s)]
*  He's got like 30% support, however, he's not going to beat Biden. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4545.52s)]
*  You've said that before. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4548.4800000000005s)]
*  I think everybody knows it. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4549.280000000001s)]
*  He's the weakest candidate in the field. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4550.88s)]
*  I think you guys really want to get a win and you want to move past him. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4553.120000000001s)]
*  So I think this combination of the Republican party flipping on him and you're starting to see [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4556.080000000001s)]
*  the crack and people starting to criticize him. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4561.4400000000005s)]
*  Once the evidence comes out and people see him in court and people hear the details of his criminal [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4565.120000000001s)]
*  behavior, his abhorrent behavior, his behavior that Vivek, Governor Christie, either side of the [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4570.88s)]
*  aisle would never participate in. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4578.08s)]
*  I think there's going to be kind of the United States is going to say, you know what, pardon him, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4579.92s)]
*  blanket pardon if he just steps out of public life. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4584.8s)]
*  And I think Biden's going to need a pardon too for Hunter. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4588.400000000001s)]
*  And so I think this could be the solution for everybody to move forward. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4591.68s)]
*  It sounds crazy, but I think that the stuff that's going to come out is going to be much [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4595.04s)]
*  worse than Watergate specifically. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4598.8s)]
*  Again, I'll reference the article of some of the behavior of his whack pack and what they were [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4600.96s)]

*  And so this could plea out. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4657.68s)]

*  Pete Slauson I don't. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4671.52s)]
*  I just think that you cannot think rationally when it comes to this stuff anymore. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4672.0s)]
*  Jason Vale Okay, fine. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4677.68s)]
*  Pete Slauson You didn't know that Biden appointed Merrick [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4678.8s)]

*  Pete Slauson The one thing that's definitely not going to happen is Trump takes a plea deal. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4697.6s)]

*  Jason Vale I said it last August when they raided Mar-a-Lago is that the way they're carrying on [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4708.08s)]
*  with these lawfare attacks on Trump. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4714.16s)]
*  We now have the fourth indictment. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4716.400000000001s)]
*  Apparently, he's a mobster. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4718.0s)]
*  They're going after him with a RICO statute that was invented to get organized crime and mobsters. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4719.280000000001s)]
*  And apparently, these lawyers you relied on, as dopey as they were, apparently they're like [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4724.0s)]
*  button men for the mob who have to be indicted as well under this RICO statute. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4728.16s)]
*  I think people can see this for what it is, which is it's a – I'm trying to think of the right word. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4732.400000000001s)]

*  They're bending the law in any way they can to go after Donald Trump. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4740.08s)]
*  And I know that his behavior wasn't good in this, but I don't think it was. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4742.96s)]
*  Jared [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4746.32s)]
*  You don't think he's criminal? [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4751.28s)]
*  Okay. Interesting. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4752.0s)]
*  Pete Slauson Let's look at that Fox News poll where they asked… [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4752.96s)]
*  Jared Do you think the Republican Party is going to cut ties? [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4755.12s)]
*  Pete Slauson I think the Fox News poll asked the right question, [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4760.08s)]
*  which is in connection with efforts to overturn 2020 election, did Donald Trump do something [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4762.24s)]
*  illegal? Something wrong? Not illegal? [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4768.32s)]
*  Nothing seriously wrong. I'm in the middle bucket. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4770.400000000001s)]
*  I think it was wrong, but not illegal. Look, I think that what Democrats are doing with this [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4773.28s)]
*  partisan lawfare is that they are polarizing the outcomes. They're either going to send [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4777.52s)]
*  Donald Trump to the big house or to the White House. That's what I said back in August last [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4782.96s)]
*  year when they raided Mar-a-Lago. Is they're going to send him to the big house or the White House? [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4786.8s)]
*  Jared I'm here for the pardon. I'm here for the pardon. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4791.28s)]
*  Do you think the Republican Party is going to support him or do you think they're going to [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4793.76s)]
*  break ties and try to move on? And what do you think they should do as a strategist? [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4796.96s)]
*  Pete I'm trying to explain this. They see the way in which the law is being misused, is being [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4800.879999999999s)]
*  weaponized in a partisan way to get one of the major candidates for president. They're trying [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4806.879999999999s)]
*  to drive him out of the election. Jared I know. Do you think the Republicans [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4811.36s)]
*  are going to stand by him as he goes to court and these trials start happening? [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4814.16s)]
*  Pete I think that there's … [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4818.08s)]
*  Jared They're rallying or cut ties? [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4818.879999999999s)]
*  Pete Of course, they're rallying around him. It's ensuring that he will be the nominee. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4819.919999999999s)]

*  Pete Well, no, I want to hear you throw them into the bus and say, but we'll see. Someday you will. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4990.8s)]
*  Someday you'll stand up against him. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4995.120000000001s)]
*  Jared I said what I did was wrong. I just don't think it was organized crime. It wasn't a RICO [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=4996.64s)]
*  indictment. Give me a f**k break. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5001.200000000001s)]
*  Pete I want to hear you say he should drop out of the race. As an influencer in the party, [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5001.76s)]
*  I want you to say you should drop out. That's all I want you to say. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5006.64s)]
*  Jared All right, let's move on. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5008.72s)]
*  Pete How about Dave Portnoy? You want to talk about Dave Portnoy? [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5009.4400000000005s)]
*  Jared No, I want to talk about Adyen being down 40% of it. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5011.92s)]
*  Pete Okay. Adyen is a stock republic. That's a competitor to Stripe. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5014.72s)]
*  Jared Since 2018, this one's incredible. Since 2018, Adyen has reported every six month period [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5021.4400000000005s)]
*  of growth at least 26% or greater. And they reaffirmed a 65% EBITDA margin. And they were [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5029.28s)]
*  down at one point today, 40%. And so, if you look at Adyen, what does it mean about Stripe? [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5039.04s)]
*  And I think the answer is that Stripe at that $50 billion round, $55 billion round, [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5052.96s)]
*  is worth $25 billion. So, there's a 50% markdown right there. That's a 25%- [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5058.8s)]
*  Pete At 100? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5064.4s)]
*  Pete At 100? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5064.88s)]
*  Pete Bill Gurley had a great tweet on this. Multiple compression is a bitch. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5065.679999999999s)]
*  Jared Multiple, Gurley's been saying that for a long time. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5069.92s)]
*  Pete Same thing that's happening in real estate. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5073.12s)]
*  Jared Yeah. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5075.04s)]
*  Pete The reason why those- [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5075.84s)]
*  Jared I mean, it might be a buy. It might be a buy. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5077.04s)]
*  Pete The reason those multifamily developers are getting whammied right now is, again, [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5078.48s)]
*  it's not because of vacancy. Everyone wants their apartments. The problem is multiple [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5082.5599999999995s)]
*  compressions. The value is much lower, which means they can't get as much debt. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5087.12s)]
*  So, all of a sudden, they got to pony up a bunch of equity or get expensive mezz [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5091.04s)]
*  to fill out the capital stack. This is the problem is there's multiple compression everywhere. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5097.2s)]
*  Jared More pain to come. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5101.2s)]
*  Pete Yes. It's taking time to work through this estate. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5102.56s)]
*  Jared This is a train. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5104.88s)]
*  Jared What is Stripe worth? [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5105.76s)]
*  Pete Not a car. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5106.64s)]
*  Jared Sacks. David, where do you buy Sacks? Where do you buy Stripe? [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5106.96s)]
*  Pete I think you're right. I think that we have a almost perfect comp there. So, yeah, you're [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5110.24s)]
*  right. Down 46% year to date. That doesn't even include what happened last year. Right? [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5116.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5121.52s)]
*  Jared So, I think you're right. 20, 20, 25. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5121.84s)]
*  Pete The thing to remember about all these businesses, [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5123.6s)]
*  Stripe, Adyen, PayPal, is that they're middlemen businesses, which by definition means that they [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5127.360000000001s)]
*  don't have pricing power. They actually have to reflect the prevalent pricing power of the [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5131.92s)]
*  incumbent sponsors of their technology. So, for example, if you have a deal with McDonald's, [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5136.64s)]
*  McDonald's bids you out to five different people and they pick the cheapest one, right? So, [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5142.400000000001s)]
*  your margins over time tend to be compressed. And over time, your share of profits tend to be [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5148.08s)]
*  compressed and you have to give up a lot. So, how do you maintain profitability? So, when Adyen [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5155.28s)]
*  maintains 65% EBITDA margins in the face of this revenue decline, the only way they can do that is [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5159.839999999999s)]
*  by cutting staff, using more technology, and creating OPEX leverage that replaces what they're [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5165.679999999999s)]
*  losing. So, the real takeaway is that this is a very tough, tough business that is a race to the [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5171.04s)]
*  bottom. And it is a surplus business that benefits the buyer, i.e. the Ubers, the McDonald's, the [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5178.48s)]
*  DoorDashes of the world, not the seller, i.e. the Adyen's, the PayPal's, the Stripes. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5185.5199999999995s)]
*  Jared What's the changing cost? You know, if you're at Uber and you negotiate a deal for three years [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5190.56s)]
*  with Stripe and then you go to Adyen and you negotiate your next deal and they want to win [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5195.36s)]
*  it because they need the top line revenue and now you got a dogfight, you know, let alone all the [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5200.56s)]
*  other players who are going to do competitors. David These are all race to the bottom businesses. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5204.64s)]
*  Jared Tough business. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5207.84s)]
*  David Tough business. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5208.96s)]
*  Jared If you have a very diffuse business model where you're trying to do too many things [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5209.68s)]
*  and so as a result you have a somewhat bloated OPEX relative to a company that's going to do [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5214.0s)]
*  a lot less but do it just much better, I think you're going to be very challenged. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5217.92s)]
*  David Yeah. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5221.92s)]
*  Jared Well, you know, this could be the buying opportunity for a lot of these [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5222.88s)]
*  equities if you believe in them long term. I saw Dan Loeb is placing a bunch of bets, [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5227.36s)]
*  he bought some Uber, he bought Nvidia, you know, he's out there buying up stuff so. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5231.44s)]
*  David We'll see. Let's talk about DaPort. I think this is like a very interesting one, [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5235.679999999999s)]
*  we didn't get to it last week. Penn Gaming, a gambling company and gambling's become legal [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5238.96s)]
*  in the United States. Sports wagering has been accepted by the NBA, ESPN, TV shows, everything, [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5243.2s)]
*  it's been incorporated into. David I've been gambling for fucking 30 years. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5248.16s)]
*  David Of course, but now it's been integrated into- [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5251.679999999999s)]
*  Jared You know the funniest- [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5256.16s)]
*  David All the buttons are off. All the buttons are gone. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5257.599999999999s)]
*  Jared The funniest thing is when I bought a piece of the Warriors, the funniest thing was I got a [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5260.799999999999s)]
*  call from the NBA because you have to submit like this huge application like, you know, [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5265.679999999999s)]
*  everything, open the kimono. And they knew that I was a big fucking sports bettor and they were [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5270.719999999999s)]
*  like, hey, dipshit, we'll allow you to sports bet in Vegas if you show the tickets. But otherwise, [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5276.4s)]
*  they knew who my bookie was. They were like, you cannot call this guy anymore. You can't sports. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5285.04s)]
*  It was crazy. David [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5289.76s)]
*  What does it mean I can't call? Okay. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5290.96s)]

*  David I said- [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5297.360000000001s)]
*  Jared So, Nick, delete the fucking- [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5297.6s)]
*  David We'll delete the first part. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzobkV_CgU&t=5302.64s)]
