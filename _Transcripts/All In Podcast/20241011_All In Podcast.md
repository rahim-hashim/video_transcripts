**All In Podcast:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM)
*  Alright, everybody, welcome back to the number one science, politics, technology and business [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=0.0s)]
*  podcast in the world for five years running. We're about to hit our fourth anniversary here, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=5.84s)]
*  Episode 200 is coming up. And a bunch of lunatic fans are getting together, you can join them all [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=11.92s)]
*  in.com slash meetups. Holy cow, we got the domain name Paul in fantastic. Go to all in.com slash [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=17.28s)]
*  meetups. And hey, subscribe to our YouTube channel, we're going to do some sort of crazy event [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=24.32s)]
*  for the million subscriber party. We're like 300,000 way gentlemen. This is nuts. Huh? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=31.52s)]
*  Can you imagine this thing made it to 200 episodes? We have all in.com. How much do we spend on this? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=37.6s)]
*  This is great. I negotiated it. I got it. It took me two years. And I got a sick deal on it. I don't [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=42.0s)]
*  even want to say because I you know, I don't want to change it. But I think I got it. Don't say. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=49.76s)]
*  I'll just say you believe it out. I got it for or so. And that's a million dollar domain. Just so we [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=56.0s)]
*  all know five letters in the dictionary. So good for branding. Good job, Jacob. Thank you, my friend. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Now we have all in.com slash tequila. Oh, I love it. Exactly. Exactly. And you can yum yum. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=67.36s)]
*  I got you sax.com didn't I you have the domain name? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I need to go share that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=74.16s)]
*  for you. Wow, we have all the way back to Episode One. This is incredible. Oh, the new website. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=77.92s)]
*  Yeah, this is great. Oh, can I tell you, if I may, all in.com all in.com. That's our website. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=83.6s)]
*  It's like this thing is real. Yeah, it's like a real thing. After four years, we got our together. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=91.04s)]
*  This looks great. Here we go. And I want to give a shout out to podcast AI, one of our [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=96.16s)]
*  remember those fake all in episodes that became a startup podcast AI and they built our website [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=101.44s)]
*  for us. So shout out to the team over there. All right, ladies, let's move on. And I am of course, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=105.76s)]
*  your executive producer for life and some moderate podcast. And if I may just a tiny plug. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=111.2s)]
*  If you're a founder, we are having our ninth cohort of Founder University. It's a 12 week course I [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=119.28s)]
*  teach on starting companies. What are you doing? Stop. I'm just giving up for Founder University. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=123.92s)]
*  I need to get a plug in because I want to be fun. Go to Aero One and buy Supergut bars. $3.99. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=130.72s)]
*  You can pick them up this afternoon. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=136.0s)]
*  Speaking of that, your people use me in an ad, Breedberg. So don't talk about plugs. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=154.48s)]
*  A few weeks ago when I shouted out that Glue AI was hiring engineers, we had like a hundred [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=160.56s)]
*  applications just from that. From Glue AI looking for engineers? From one plug on the show. Yeah. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=164.4s)]
*  For Glue AI. Yeah. Right. That's awesome for Glue AI. And if you haven't tried Supergut, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=169.12s)]
*  Freeberg's team literally made an advertisement with me talking about Supergut and didn't tell me. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=174.96s)]
*  And we're still hiring. So. Okay. Well, there you have it. So go to founder.university to apply for [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  my 12 week program. Check out Grok. I'm running a GoFundMe. Go to GoFundMe. For what? Where's [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=186.08s)]
*  Xanax to deal with your panic attacks? All right. Let's get started. Enough of the shenanigans. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=193.28s)]
*  Hurricane season is upon us as Freeberg have predicted. Hurricane Milton made land fall on [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=198.96s)]
*  Wednesday evening along the West Coast of Florida. As many of you know, it's been downgraded. It [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=206.8s)]
*  started as a category five potentially, then a category three, and then it looks like it's a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=213.52s)]
*  category one now. So I guess these things are quite random. Leading up to Milton, those six [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=217.6s)]
*  million Floridians across 15 counties were ordered to evacuate. That's a lot of people moving out. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  And it was a pretty powerful storm. It ripped off the roof of the Tropicana field in Tampa. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  So far the death toll is at four, but it's expected to rise sadly. And just two weeks ago, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=236.32s)]
*  Hurricane Helene swept through six southern states killing over 220 people tragically. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=241.92s)]
*  Devastating western North Carolina and entire towns were wiped out. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  These are also beyond the tragic human losses are economically staggering in terms of the losses. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=254.0s)]
*  AccuWeather estimating the total economic damage could be between 145 and 160 billion from Helen. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=261.68s)]
*  And Moody estimates the property damage alone could be as high as 26 billion. Tons to get into [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=267.92s)]
*  here. FEMA, Starlink saving the day, tons of stuff. But Freeberg, back on episode 182, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=273.52s)]
*  you predicted this would happen. What's causing all this? And let's just start with the science [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  angle, I guess, before we get into the other political and insurance issues. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think if you'll remember when we talked about this a couple months ago, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=288.79999999999995s)]
*  the sea surface temperature was at kind of a record high in the Atlantic. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  And warm ocean temperatures drive moist air up that evaporates. The warmer the air, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=298.56s)]
*  the faster the evaporation. And that starts to cause the movement of the air, which drives [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=307.12s)]
*  ultimately the hurricane. And then the hurricane sucks up more warm, moist air from the ocean, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=311.76s)]
*  and it creates a feedback loop. So the more energy you have in the ocean, the more likely you are to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=316.64s)]
*  accelerate wind forces in storms. And that's why you get these massive hurricanes that suddenly [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=321.92s)]
*  form seemingly overnight and go like in the case of Helene, that hurricane went from a cap to, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  to a cap for or cap five and like 48 hours. Because of the energy that sort of a 90% here's [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=334.16s)]
*  an interesting stat 90% of the energy that we get from the sun is absorbed and stored in our oceans. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=340.72s)]
*  The other kind of fact that's playing into this, if you pull up that science, that nature article, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=346.64s)]
*  and this is something that I think you guys may remember we talked about. So this was an article [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=350.56s)]
*  that came out a paper, a science paper that came out a couple of months ago. And in this paper, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=355.12s)]
*  the scientists identified that removing sulfur dioxide from cargo ships that travel across the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=361.36s)]
*  oceans is actually causing accelerated warming in the oceans. And the reason is that the sulfur [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=367.68s)]
*  dioxide forms cloud formations. And those clouds, they travel across the oceans and those cloud [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=374.8s)]
*  formations reflect sunlight. And in the absence of those cloud formations, that sunlight makes its [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=380.56s)]
*  way into the ocean and you get more ocean warming. And by their estimation, removing sulfur dioxide, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=386.08s)]
*  which causes acid rain, and that's the reason it's been pushed to be removed. And they started [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=394.08000000000004s)]
*  removing it in 2020 2021 from cargo vessels by removing sulfur dioxide, we are now going to see [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=398.56s)]
*  a doubling of the rate of warming of the oceans in the 2020s and going forward. Let me pause there [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=405.44s)]
*  for a second just to make sure people understand what you're saying. Emissions from cargo ships [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=411.92s)]
*  block sunlight, which then of course reduces the heat absorbed by the oceans. And so we're now [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=416.88s)]
*  choosing between pollution of the air or overheating of the oceans. Am I correct in [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=423.12s)]
*  summarizing that? That's roughly it. And what is the pollution again? Sorry, I just saw it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=428.96s)]
*  It's emissions. Sulfur dioxide. Yeah, that goes into the fuel of cargo vessels. And a couple of [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=436.08s)]
*  years ago, they started to implement these mandates that sulfur dioxide no longer be used in the fuel. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=442.4s)]
*  As a result, when sulfur dioxide is emitted from these vessels, it goes into the atmosphere, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=447.92s)]
*  and it actually triggers cloud formation. So now you have these clouds that are forming and Nick's [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  going to pull up this image right now. Yeah, here you can see that. So all of these cracks [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=458.8s)]
*  are these cargo vessels moving across the ocean. And as they move across the ocean, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=463.36s)]
*  they create cloud cover that cover actually reduces the warming in the ocean because it [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=466.88s)]
*  reflects sunlight. So now that sunlight energy gets absorbed into the ocean. So this is another [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=472.32s)]
*  driving force that some people are now speculating, maybe accelerating the warming of the oceans that [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=477.68s)]
*  we're seeing, which drives this extreme storm and hurricane events. And so this becomes a more [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=482.56s)]
*  frequent event. Now, a lot of people- Sorry, can I ask you a question? Does that mean that we're [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=488.4s)]
*  mean reverting? Meaning if we improve the quality of the fuel source that are used in shipping, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=492.08s)]
*  doesn't that then mean that we're reverting back to what would have happened in the absence of [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=498.64000000000004s)]
*  these dirty fuel sources? Yeah. So in addition- No, no, I'm asking you the question. Is that true or [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=503.76s)]
*  not? So yes, we are no longer reflecting as much sunlight. And so for several decades- [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=510.96000000000004s)]
*  We had bad fuel sources- We had artificial cooling, effectively. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=517.9200000000001s)]
*  We had an artificial cooling, and now we take- But that's counter to the narrative of what we all [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=521.9200000000001s)]
*  think is happening. Oh, well, the argument is that we've actually been warming the atmosphere, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=527.0400000000001s)]
*  which we have been. We can see the data that shows that everywhere, all over the earth, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=532.0s)]
*  not just about sunlight coming in on the oceans and not just ocean warming, but the atmosphere is [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=535.44s)]
*  warming, the planet is warming. And so this is by blocking the sunlight above the oceans, we were [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=540.88s)]
*  artificially dampening that effect. And we were reducing the amount of heat energy that was getting [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=547.36s)]
*  into the oceans. So now by taking that away, we're seeing the heat energy in the oceans [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=552.24s)]
*  accelerate, and now the oceans are getting much, much warmer. Much faster. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=556.64s)]
*  So the pollution was good? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=559.76s)]
*  Turns out it was good. That's the paradox here. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=561.28s)]
*  Yeah. Is that it was creating a blocker for sunlight. And to your point, Chamath, exactly, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=563.52s)]
*  like shouldn't we just be going back to what was normal? But at the same time, in the same system, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=569.36s)]
*  we had heated things up. So this is a multi-factor system that we're dealing with, Friedberg, and [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=574.16s)]
*  I guess the takeaway from all of this is that we got to be really careful with what we do with the [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=580.72s)]
*  environment, right? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=585.52s)]
*  Well, I mean, let's talk about economics, right? So how much real estate do you guys think is on [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=586.32s)]
*  the Florida coastline? What's the real estate value? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=592.1600000000001s)]
*  Well, sorry, Friedberg, can you just anchor this? Like, was it that it was supposed to be a category [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=594.8000000000001s)]
*  five, and now it's a category three when it hit land? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=598.88s)]
*  Right. So what happens typically when storms hit land is they no longer have that hot ocean [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=601.76s)]
*  pumping energy back into the storm that keeps the feedback loop going. And so it's a lot of [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=605.9200000000001s)]
*  going. So the storm cycle starts to break down all hurricanes when they hit land, they start to break [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=610.24s)]
*  apart. And so the category, which measures the wind speed actually reduces this is just a natural [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=616.0s)]
*  thing that happens. But this was a category five hurricane when it made landfall, I believe it was [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=622.08s)]
*  category four. So, you know, it was a massive hurricane as an approach. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=627.04s)]
*  We should not dismiss it, because my understanding was Helen was cat for when it like hit North [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=632.32s)]
*  Carolina. But I read yesterday that happened. Yeah, what happened with Helen was it was [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=639.36s)]
*  built for is cat three when it hit Tampa or something. Is that not? Yeah, yeah. So that's [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=644.72s)]
*  right. But what happened when Helene hit North Carolina was not a cat for what happened is, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=649.12s)]
*  as that storm moved inland, it hit the mountains and the first mountains that hit are on western [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=654.16s)]
*  North Carolina, that area is elevated, there's mountains there. So when a heavy hot storm runs [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=661.04s)]
*  into cold mountains, all the moisture dumps out, it's like it runs into it. And suddenly [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=666.24s)]
*  everything precipitates out of that storm. And that's why some parts of western North Carolina [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=670.96s)]
*  got like 18. Some high some people measured as high as 30 inches of rainfall in a couple of hours. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=674.88s)]
*  So this insane dumping happens when that hot air hits cold hits a cold region. And suddenly [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=680.64s)]
*  everything all that warm moisture precipitates out and dumps to the ground. So it ran into a [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=685.6s)]
*  mountain is effectively why everything fell out in North Carolina. Right. So you're saying that it [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=690.0s)]
*  wasn't Democrats who basically? Right. I blame Putin. Who did it, Sax? I thought Nancy Pelosi [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=694.56s)]
*  cast a spell or something. Well, isn't there a lot of geoengineering conspiracy theories going on in [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=704.0799999999999s)]
*  your cohort? I mean, what's your- I don't think so. But Vinod wants us to be very clear that we [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=710.0s)]
*  need to, we need to stop all this disinformation that somehow Democrats are behind that storm. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=715.68s)]
*  Well, there are a lot of sure everyone that it was just a lot of theory online that there's a ton of [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=721.36s)]
*  lazy geoengineering being run by government agencies. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=726.8s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think people aren't taking that seriously. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=729.84s)]
*  Well, I mean, the origin of this, though, free bird is people have done experiments for decades [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=732.16s)]
*  on trying to control the weather or alter the weather. And they're doing that in the Middle [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=739.2s)]
*  East by seeding clouds and creating more rain. We saw that with the Dubai floods, they said that [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=743.76s)]
*  that might have been caused by over seeding of clouds, which they're doing there. And then there [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=748.56s)]
*  have been experiments just to, you know, for the crazy laser people conspiracy theorists, they're a [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=752.8s)]
*  son ex. There actually have been experiments with lasers, you know, being shot into hurricanes and [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=758.88s)]
*  storms, correct? Are you Alex Jones? Is that what we're doing? Well, no, we're not saying Alex Jones. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=764.88s)]
*  I'm just saying that's the origin of where people are kind of building on this. There have been the [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=771.5999999999999s)]
*  amount. Okay, so let's just talk about the hurricane. The amount of [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=775.2s)]
*  teeing it up for you to debunk is what I'm doing here. Yeah. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=778.72s)]
*  Putting particulates in clouds to accelerate precipitation is I mean, we've done that for [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=781.2s)]
*  100 years. You know, you can do you can increase the precipitation rate when there's already clouds [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=786.32s)]
*  that have formed. But that has nothing to do with creating 200 mile an hour wind speed. That requires [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=791.5200000000001s)]
*  an extraordinary amount of energy, all of this energy that the oceans are like giant batteries. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=797.6800000000001s)]
*  And when a hurricane gets going, that battery is accelerating the hurricane and the hurricane [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=803.28s)]
*  sucks up more power from the battery. And it creates this incredibly dynamical system, there [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=807.68s)]
*  is no human created energy system that can force form a hurricane. A hurricane is an extraordinarily [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=811.8399999999999s)]
*  powerful natural phenomenon that arises from the amount of energy that can come out of very, very, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=817.68s)]
*  very hot oceans, relatively speaking. So you know, that's really where these hurricanes are coming [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=822.16s)]
*  from. Now they're going to be more frequent if the ocean temperatures remain elevated as they seem [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=826.8s)]
*  to be and continue to be elevated. And this can be a function of generally the temperatures warming [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=831.12s)]
*  on earth, generally the removal of sulfur dioxide, generally these El Nino La Nina cycles. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=837.12s)]
*  There's a lot of factors, but it seems to be the case that we are having a very significant trend [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=842.96s)]
*  of continuously warmer oceans. And those continuously warmer oceans means that we're [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=848.16s)]
*  going to have what used to be called a one in 500 year storm, which is what Asheville is being [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=852.08s)]
*  turned at one in 500 year. These sorts of storm events can happen every couple of years. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=856.24s)]
*  And we're now looking at one in a hundred year events happening every two to three years [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=860.96s)]
*  in the United States with the hurricane activity that we've been seeing. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=865.12s)]
*  I think a lot of the conspiracy theories are built on actual experiments that happen. This one [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=868.48s)]
*  project storm fury, I'm sure you know about, was to try to modify hurricanes by putting in some [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=872.72s)]
*  chemicals that would freeze them and dull them. So they're kind of building on this. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=879.52s)]
*  Break it apart. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=884.08s)]
*  Yeah, breaking apart. So, you know, there, there, there have been experiments here with altering [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=885.04s)]
*  weather, altering hurricanes, but that doesn't mean it's Putin, Pelosi, or, you know, the [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=889.68s)]
*  Illuminati. So let's get, let's get back to brass tacks. So let's talk about the economics. So [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=896.0s)]
*  there's, there's 500 billion to a trillion dollars of real estate value on the Florida coastline. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=900.16s)]
*  And what used to be a one in a hundred year event, the average Florida homeowner historically has [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=905.28s)]
*  been paying about 1% of the real estate value and insurance. So now if your real estate is likely [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=909.04s)]
*  to be wiped out one out of every 20 years, instead of one out of every 500 years, the cost of [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=914.32s)]
*  insurance gets to the point that it is untenable for most people to pay for their insurance. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=921.12s)]
*  Florida has a state-backed reinsurance provider called the Florida hurricane catastrophe front [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=926.6400000000001s)]
*  fund. And this fund issues debt to meet its coverage demands because it reinsures insurance [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=931.5200000000001s)]
*  companies in order to incentivize them to come into the state and underwrite. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=936.8000000000001s)]
*  You should explain the loop here, which is you go and get a mortgage. The bank says you need to get [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=941.52s)]
*  insurance if I'm going to lend you the money to buy the home. So then a bunch of insurers need [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=948.24s)]
*  to decide that they're willing to underwrite that area. And then when they give you that insurance, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=953.76s)]
*  they then want to lay that risk off and go to a reinsure. Is that the cycle? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=958.4s)]
*  That's right. And what's happening is they would normally underwrite that risk. They would say, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=962.0s)]
*  this is going to cost, you're going to lose the value of your home every 100 years or every 200 [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=966.64s)]
*  years. But now the models are showing because of the frequency of these sorts of hurricane events [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=971.1999999999999s)]
*  and the severity of the hurricane events, that maybe you'll lose the value of your home once [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=977.12s)]
*  every 20 years or once every 30 years. And no consumer is going to be willing or able to pay [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=981.04s)]
*  that much for the insurance on their home. So the state over the last several years has had to step [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=986.56s)]
*  in and effectively subsidize the insurance. And now the state reinsurance vehicle only has [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=991.76s)]
*  statutory liability maximum of $17 billion in a single hurricane season. Now, I think they got [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=998.72s)]
*  lucky with Milton today, but some were estimating that the Milton losses were going to be in excess [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1005.2s)]
*  of 100 billion, bigger than Katrina. It's likely as of this morning, the reinsurance websites are [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1009.52s)]
*  all saying it's probably a 40 to $50 billion loss event, which still exceeds the state's [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1015.12s)]
*  reinsurance capacity. So you can kind of think about Florida state's reinsurance thing being [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1020.32s)]
*  effectively bankrupt. It doesn't really have the capacity to underwrite the insurance anymore. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1024.56s)]
*  So the real question for everyone is, is the federal government going to have to step in [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1029.6000000000001s)]
*  and start to support the price of homes? Because if they don't, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1033.92s)]
*  Well, it's a terrible precedent to set because if you do it for Florida, then you'll have to do it [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1036.48s)]
*  in Texas and Louisiana and California with wildfires, Arizona, there's there and Texas, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1042.16s)]
*  there's going to be no way to create a clear demarcation of who gets a bailout and who doesn't, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1047.92s)]
*  I mean, which will mean that everybody will get a bailout or nobody gets a bailout. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1053.2s)]
*  That's right. And if everybody gets a bailout, and if you think about how [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1057.3600000000001s)]
*  systematically unpredictable, at least in the southern states, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1060.5600000000002s)]
*  the weather is, you're going to be talking hundreds of billions of dollars a year, probably. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1064.48s)]
*  The total value of all mortgages and homeowner mortgages in Florida is $454 billion. And those [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1068.64s)]
*  people typically have, you know, a debt to equity ratio, probably on the 50 to 80% range. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1075.12s)]
*  So if the value of your home dips by 25%, because everyone starts selling their homes, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1080.1599999999999s)]
*  leaving Florida, or they can't get insurance, then the people that live in Florida, most of them have [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1084.08s)]
*  their net worth tied up in their home, are going to see their personal net worth wiped out or cut [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1089.36s)]
*  in half. So it's not just an economic problem, it's a social problem, that now there are so many [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1093.52s)]
*  people that have put their entire net worth into their home, the value of their home is written to [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1098.7199999999998s)]
*  a point that it no longer makes sense, given the frequency at which homes are going to get [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1102.8s)]
*  destroyed. That's probably the reason why they'll have to do it, because they'll... [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1106.3999999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1110.72s)]
*  But then that calculation will have to happen for every single homeowner in every single state [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1111.36s)]
*  where this is an issue. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1116.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1118.1599999999999s)]
*  Wait, Freebear, are you saying the entire Florida coastline is no longer economically viable? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1118.3999999999999s)]
*  No, it's totally viable. It's just the question is, what are you willing to... [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1123.68s)]
*  At what price? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1126.8s)]
*  At what price? Will you pay 5% of your home value for insurance every year? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1127.6s)]
*  Will you pay 2%, 3%? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1132.4s)]
*  If the expected life of a house is 20 years, then that's not viable. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1134.0s)]
*  It becomes very, very untenable. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1140.24s)]
*  Well, it used to be one in 500 years, now it's probably one in 15, right? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1142.08s)]
*  Does this apply to the entire coastline or just parts of it? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1144.96s)]
*  Well, I mean, you saw that the range at which these events can happen is all over the place. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1148.6399999999999s)]
*  And the challenge is the events are getting more significant [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1152.48s)]
*  because of this warm ocean weather that we see, this warm ocean temperature. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1157.12s)]
*  The only good news, Freeberg, is that now people are building the first couple of floors in high [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1160.8799999999999s)]
*  rises in Miami and homes on stilts with concrete and with salt water resistant material. So there [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1166.08s)]
*  is a counter to this. So we might be looking at... [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1173.6s)]
*  An investment in climate resilience. That's right. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1175.84s)]
*  Yeah. So it might actually be an opportunity to upgrade all these homes to [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1177.84s)]
*  resistant ones using another set of technologies. But the bailout is really interesting too, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1182.0s)]
*  because Florida's got a lot of electoral college votes, doesn't it? I hate to bring this back to [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1187.4399999999998s)]
*  politics, but promising people bailouts is how these politicians seem to be getting votes these [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1193.6s)]
*  days. Is anyone talking about a federal bailout? This is something you're predicting. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1202.08s)]
*  I think what Freeberg is saying is that there's a pretty obvious parade of parables here where [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1206.2399999999998s)]
*  the question will have to be answered one way or the other. Because if you only have a $17 billion [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1211.36s)]
*  reinsurance fund and there's 50 billion of damage, somebody's going to have to come in and cover the [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1216.8s)]
*  gap. And if it's the insurance companies, expect your insurance premiums to double or triple. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1222.08s)]
*  That's right. And that's what happened in California. And by the way, State Farm left [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1227.44s)]
*  a lot of California. This is what I was going to say. Most of these big insurance companies [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1230.72s)]
*  have already done the calculus to realize that these regions are no longer profitable enough [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1235.12s)]
*  to justify the downside risk. That's the bigger problem. So then the ones that are left are [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1239.76s)]
*  insolvent reinsurers or insurers that are just funding short-term ARBs because they know that [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1245.36s)]
*  the odds are they're going to get wiped out. So they'll price gouge effectively. So a different [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1251.04s)]
*  example is that here where I live in Menlo Park, we're not in a floodplain. We're not in a [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1255.36s)]
*  fire region, none of that stuff. But in order for us to get home insurance, you have to now [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1261.04s)]
*  go through a risk assessment. And in our specific case, we were like, hey, what should we do with [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1268.32s)]
*  our roof? And they were like, you've got to take the roof off if you want home insurance. We're [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1273.12s)]
*  like, well, home insurance is probably a good thing to have. Was it a wood shake roof on your [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1276.8799999999999s)]
*  house? You saw our house. It's a beautiful wood shake roof and we had to remove it. And the two [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1280.56s)]
*  choices were a $350,000 like iron roof or like 70K for composite. And it's like, this is insane. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1284.8799999999999s)]
*  And the cost of insurance was just egregious in the absence of going in one. Anyways, we ended [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1294.3999999999999s)]
*  up getting the for most homeowners when the cost of insurance gets to a certain threshold, you don't [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1302.0s)]
*  have budget for it. You can't afford it. And so that's a lot of why the insurers leave. They'll [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1305.76s)]
*  underwrite anything at any price, but they just know that most consumers can't afford it. Here's [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1309.28s)]
*  some other interesting statistics related, but unrelated in the early 1900s, the city of Phoenix, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1312.56s)]
*  Arizona averaged five days a year of temperatures of 110 degrees or warmer. By the 2010s, Phoenix [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1317.92s)]
*  averaged during the 2010s, 27 days a year where the temperature was 110 or higher. Since 2021, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1325.12s)]
*  Phoenix averaged 42 days. And in 2024, it's been 70 days so far this year that the temperature is [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1334.0s)]
*  over 110. So this is affecting. And so there's increased risks in California with wildfires, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1341.28s)]
*  increased risk with hurricane. There are a lot of these factors and I have friends that work in [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1346.32s)]
*  reinsurance and in the insurance market. Even if you don't get affected by a wildfire or disaster, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1350.4s)]
*  when that article was in the Wall Street Journal, I think it said that the number of average days [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1356.0s)]
*  above 100 was like 100 something. Yes, that's right. And the profile, they profile this retired [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1361.6000000000001s)]
*  woman who is an insurance adjuster or something. And the whole point of the article was not that [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1367.52s)]
*  her house was destroyed or at risk, but the cost of electricity has gone just absolutely sky high. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1371.8400000000001s)]
*  Even with solar panels, even with storage, you need to basically lean on the grid. And the grid [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1377.52s)]
*  now just charges you an exorbitant amount of money. And so these folks were paying [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1384.16s)]
*  thousands of dollars a year. So if you imagine the trifecta, you have all of this climate risk [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1388.72s)]
*  that could destroy your home. You're paying an enormous premium for home insurance. And then [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1395.12s)]
*  you're paying an enormous premium for electricity from the mainline power utilities. It's not [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1399.76s)]
*  sustainable. Yeah. And just for background, FEMA manages something called the NFIP, National Flood [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1405.36s)]
*  Insurance Plan. And it's historically about 50% cheaper than private flood insurance. They have [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1412.56s)]
*  4.7 million active policies providing 1.3 trillion in coverage. But they instituted a new risk [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1420.08s)]
*  assessment system and that caused rates to increase. And yeah, it's because of all this, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1427.12s)]
*  the policies have decreased over the last couple years, meaning less people have flood insurance [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1434.32s)]
*  at the same time that these things are getting worse. And so yeah, this is a really tough issue. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1438.8799999999999s)]
*  I wonder if this is an opportunity, Chema. If you think about historically how insurance worked, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1446.48s)]
*  it worked in communities where people would help each other out and do barn raising kind of events [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1454.08s)]
*  when somebody had a problem. So if we just put on our entrepreneurial hats here, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1459.76s)]
*  if you look at the cost of insurance, if a hundred different people bundled the cost of their homes [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1464.4s)]
*  together, put money into some sort of platform, like an Uber, Airbnb marketplace, and there was [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1469.12s)]
*  some management structure here of self-insurance, because I know some people are doing self-insurance [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1475.04s)]
*  for healthcare at their companies for this kind of thing. Do you think there's going to be a new [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1478.96s)]
*  business opportunity here? Well, that's called a mutual. And those are like, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1484.08s)]
*  I mean, a good chunk of the industry are mutuals where the shareholders are the members and they [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1489.76s)]
*  all share the risk and the ownership. Those things work because you have broad geographic [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1495.04s)]
*  coverage. If you had to go just into Malibu and self-insure, the rates would literally be [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1500.24s)]
*  greater than the value of the home. Right. No one would pay into it. So if you do proper [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1506.8799999999999s)]
*  underwriting, what's happened in the last couple of years is all the reinsurance companies and all [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1510.96s)]
*  the insurance companies have had to re-underwrite the rates that they charge for insurance, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1514.64s)]
*  because the frequency of a disaster has gone up and the new price that they should be charging [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1517.92s)]
*  is so high, it doesn't matter how the capital structure is set up. It's simply, there's one [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1523.2s)]
*  big event that's going to cause a big wipeout for a large number. My personal belief is I think that [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1528.24s)]
*  the real estate markets in some of these places are meaningfully mispriced. And specifically, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1532.8000000000002s)]
*  what I mean is that they are massively overpriced. That's right. Because I think when you actually [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1541.6000000000001s)]
*  account for the climate damage and the long-term financial stability of the insurers and the [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1545.92s)]
*  reinsurers, I don't think that many of the markets that have seen these crazy sky-high prices, I'll [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1553.3600000000001s)]
*  name two to be specific, West Palm Beach and Malibu. So both ends of the coasts, these things [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1560.4s)]
*  just don't make sense. And I think people view these things as investments, but on the West Coast, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1567.68s)]
*  when you deal with things like soil erosion and other things, I think it's a calamity waiting to [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1573.04s)]
*  happen. And I think on the East Coast, when you factor in the extreme weather conditions, even [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1578.6399999999999s)]
*  Jason, your comment about rebuilding these homes in a more foolproof way doesn't solve it because [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1584.1599999999999s)]
*  you won't be able to rebuild the entire state. There's a lot of people that just can't afford it. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1588.96s)]
*  There's a lot of folks that will not have adequate coverage. So I just think these are disasters [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1595.84s)]
*  waiting to happen, unfortunately. Yeah. And Sax, there's a movement right now. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1602.56s)]
*  A lot of people, even of means, are renting their homes. And so in the real estate market, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1609.12s)]
*  what are your thoughts on that? Just renting versus buying now becoming something that people [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1615.12s)]
*  in the top half of homeowners or potential homeowners are now electing to not own their [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1622.48s)]
*  home and rent? Have you been monitoring that? I hadn't heard that. I mean, the trend that I [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1627.92s)]
*  thought was happening was that you had these big funds like BlackRock or whatever, buying up [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1633.44s)]
*  huge numbers of homes and then running them to low-end homes, low-end or medium to families. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1638.4s)]
*  I thought that's what was going on. I hadn't heard that at the high end of the range that [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1645.2s)]
*  people were running. Well, if you think about it, there seems to be a cap when you have a $10 million [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1649.8400000000001s)]
*  home of what you can possibly rent it for. And the prices are now making more sense to keep your [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1654.4s)]
*  money in the market or in other places and then rent. I'm just hearing that over and over again. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1662.48s)]
*  Are you long real estate in Florida or coastal California, if you could, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1667.1200000000001s)]
*  or do you treat them differently? I think they're different, but Florida is like, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1671.2s)]
*  I don't know how you do the math on... I just don't know what you do on a trillion dollars [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1676.64s)]
*  of real estate value with half a trillion of mortgages. When you have real exposure on loss [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1683.12s)]
*  more frequently than one in a hundred years, to your point, they need to be repriced. And how do [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1690.6399999999999s)]
*  you reprice those homes in the significant level that they need to be repriced without causing [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1695.12s)]
*  massive economic and social consequence? That's what's kind of, I think, challenging me in [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1699.84s)]
*  thinking about what's the path here. So is it a good thing that I sold my Miami place last year? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1704.8s)]
*  Once again, Sax makes a great trade. Pretty awesome. Well done, Sax. You top ticked it again. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1710.08s)]
*  Well done, Saxie. Just like... I really love that house. It's on the Miami Islands. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1716.3999999999999s)]
*  You love that house? Where do you think I stayed when I was in town? You're so selfish. I lost [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1724.08s)]
*  a place to stay. I mean, the yacht access alone, being able to get out on the bay and get on a boat, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1730.6399999999999s)]
*  the ski, those all this great stuff. All right, let's let's keep the Freeberg train going here. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1736.56s)]
*  Huge news. Alpha Fold creators just won a Nobel Prize in chemistry. Two members of Google's Deep [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1742.8799999999999s)]
*  Mind AI research team, Demis Hasabis and John Jumper received this year's Nobel Prize in chemistry. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1748.8799999999999s)]
*  They both worked for Google's Deep Mind, as you know, and Freeberg again, all in getting their [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1757.12s)]
*  first explained what Alpha Fold was back on episode 14 in December of 2020. That was almost [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1762.56s)]
*  four years ago. Freeberg, maybe you could explain... Did we predict that they would win the Nobel Prize? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1770.48s)]
*  I believe you did. We'll go check the receipts using the AI search engine. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1777.28s)]
*  It became much more likely that they would win the Nobel after they won the breakthrough prize. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1781.76s)]
*  I mean, just to point this out, but yeah. Shout out Yuri and Julia. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1787.76s)]
*  Because when those guys won that award for 2023, and you heard the extent of what they've done, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1795.04s)]
*  it was almost obvious that they were going to win a Nobel after the fact. So I think the really [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1804.64s)]
*  interesting thing is actually in this community, I think the breakthrough prize is actually [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1809.76s)]
*  meaningfully more relevant and a positive directional indicator to breakthrough science. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1814.32s)]
*  Well, it's kind of like winning Sundance or can win the palm door, you become a favorite to win [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1818.48s)]
*  at the Oscars, right in the Academy Awards. So that's actually interesting. The regional [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1824.8799999999999s)]
*  or more industry centric award could lead to the next one. So Freeberg, just explain to us why this [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1828.8s)]
*  is so important. I just think it's much more rigorous than the Nobel. I think the Nobel can [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1834.3999999999999s)]
*  be a little bit gained, I think. Oh, interesting. Okay. What do you think, Freeberg? Explain to the [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1838.8s)]
*  audience why this is important and what's transpired since we talked about it four years ago. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1844.0s)]
*  There's been a long challenge in biochemistry on understanding or predicting or visualizing [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1849.36s)]
*  the three dimensional structure of proteins. Because remember, proteins are produced by long [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1858.72s)]
*  chains of amino acids. And those amino acids are kind of create like a bead beaded necklace. And [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1864.24s)]
*  then the whole necklace collapses on itself in a very specific way. And that three dimensional [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1871.12s)]
*  molecule, that big chunky protein does something structurally physically. And so trying to [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1876.32s)]
*  understand the shape of a protein is really hard. I mean, we've used kind of x ray imaging systems [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1881.36s)]
*  to try and identify it and try to build models to identify how does that quote protein folding work, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1887.1999999999998s)]
*  how do those amino acids collapse on each other to create that three dimensional construct. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1892.32s)]
*  And if I don't know if you guys remember in the early 2000s, there was a Stanford folding at home [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1896.3999999999999s)]
*  distributed computing project. Do you guys remember this? Yeah. It would use people's machines [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1900.88s)]
*  and extra CPU like the study at home project to precisely Yeah, exactly. Right. Yeah. So it's like [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1906.0800000000002s)]
*  it ran on the background of your computer, use your CPU cycles when you weren't using your computer. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1911.3600000000001s)]
*  And it tried to model protein folding. And so this has been a problem that folks have tried to [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1915.68s)]
*  tackle with compute for decades to figure out the 3d structure. This is so important because if we [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1920.64s)]
*  can identify the 3d structure of proteins, and we can predict them from the amino acid sequence, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1926.4s)]
*  we can print out a sequence of amino acids to make a protein that does a specific thing for us. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1932.5600000000002s)]
*  And that unlocks this ability for humans to create biomolecules that can do everything from [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1938.4s)]
*  binding cancer to breaking apart pollutants and plastics, to, you know, creating entirely new [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1942.8000000000002s)]
*  molecules to running in some cases, like what David Baker did at University of Washington, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1949.92s)]
*  he shared the Nobel Prize, creating micro motors, mini motors from proteins that he designed on a [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1954.24s)]
*  computer. And so this becomes I think this great like big holy grail in biochemistry. And the alpha [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1960.16s)]
*  fold project at DeepMind inside of Google solved this problem. And by the way, since then they've [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1966.16s)]
*  come out with Alpha Fold 3. Yeah, they've launched a drug discovery company called isomorphic labs [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1971.44s)]
*  where they're basically predicting molecules that will do specific things for a target indication. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1976.4s)]
*  And then they use the Alpha Fold models to actually design and develop those molecules. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1982.88s)]
*  And there have been literally dozens of companies that have been started since DeepMind was [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1987.68s)]
*  published, and probably several billion dollars of capital that's gone into companies that are [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1992.16s)]
*  creating new drugs creating new industrial biotech applications using this protein modeling [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=1997.2s)]
*  capability that was unleashed with DeepMind a number of years ago. So it really has transformed [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2002.16s)]
*  the industry. It'll be a couple years before we see a transplant in the world. But it's it's an [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2006.3200000000002s)]
*  exciting kind of thing. Yeah, not to virtue signal here. But those are plus size proteins. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2011.12s)]
*  Now free bird, they don't like being called chunky, plus size proteins, plus size. Yes. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2015.9199999999998s)]
*  One one really difficult technical question for your free bird. Is there any way for you to take [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2021.52s)]
*  this amazing breakthrough and make sex interested in? Is there any possible vector here for it to [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2026.56s)]
*  relate to sex and get him off his BlackBerry right now? BlackBerry. I think he's playing [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2033.9199999999998s)]
*  chess with Teal and JD Vance is watching them play chess. I think that's what's going on right [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2040.4s)]
*  now. It's really hard. I mean, the poor audience here is watching sacks looking at. All right, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2045.44s)]
*  let's keep this train moving here. Enough of the shenanigans. Anyway, congrats to the teams, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2050.2400000000002s)]
*  the very grads that want to jump. Yeah, yeah. It's just great. And David Baker, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2055.04s)]
*  the Baker lab and University of Washington, also a breakthrough prize winner. Yeah. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2059.36s)]
*  What's interesting to me is like these two nobels, these guys, but also Jeffrey Hinton's, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2064.4s)]
*  you're really seeing now the convergence of the hard sciences and computer science. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2070.7200000000003s)]
*  Totally. In a really meaningful way. And I think that that's so interesting and cool. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2076.08s)]
*  I think in the group chat, Chamath, you had an interesting, hey, maybe there should be a [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2081.28s)]
*  computer science award for a Nobel computer science award. And I actually think it's the [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2084.88s)]
*  opposite now, which is that it's amazing to see folks using computers to improve our understanding [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2091.76s)]
*  of the natural sciences. And I think that that's a really great place to be. So what Demis and John [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2099.68s)]
*  and David are doing in the life science is amazing. What Jeffrey Hinton did 30 and 40 years ago and [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2104.7999999999997s)]
*  20 years ago in terms of training deep neural nets, also really amazing. In related computer [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2111.8399999999997s)]
*  based. Yeah, all computer based and in related news, Benioff just nominated himself for excellence [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2117.2799999999997s)]
*  in CRM management. So congratulations to Benioff on nominating himself for a Nobel. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2122.7999999999997s)]
*  What is that? Why are you attacking Benioff? What did he do wrong? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2128.16s)]
*  They're just jokes. Have you not learned anything to people that attack you? It's not an attack. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2137.68s)]
*  It's a joke. Benioff has done so much for philanthropy. Just ask him if you [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2143.44s)]
*  know. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2148.0s)]
*  Do you have a sense of humor about yourself? But it's not even it's not even funny if you had said [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2151.04s)]
*  something else. I mean, okay, give me a give me a funnier Nobel. Go ahead. Go ahead. 300 billion [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2160.32s)]
*  market cap. He's chomping at the bit to come back on the pod and explain why AI is not going to [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2166.64s)]
*  disrupt SAS. Really? Oh, we see he wants to be back on the box. He wants to come on. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2172.64s)]
*  We'll check in. We'll check in in 100 billion dollars. He had his chance. That chance is [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2177.2s)]
*  closed. He shot a shot and it did not land. That door was closed when he insulted our [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2183.9199999999996s)]
*  guests about not being able to afford the Disney. All in people wars. Oh my God. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2188.72s)]
*  Now you're piling on anybody coming to dream force 2025. Okay, let's move on. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2195.2799999999997s)]
*  Sorry. Anyways, leave Benny off alone. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2200.2400000000002s)]
*  It's like leave Britney alone. That famous meme. Leave Benny off alone. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2203.28s)]
*  So how many new enemies do you want to create? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2209.2000000000003s)]
*  I just, just jokes. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2212.1600000000003s)]
*  This one you thought he was running out of feuds, you know? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2216.8s)]
*  I'm making stupid jokes. The reason people tune in is because you laugh and learn. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2221.6800000000003s)]
*  Did you guys see that tweet that somebody suggested throwing a conference with all of [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2226.56s)]
*  J Cal's haters? Jason Con. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2231.92s)]
*  J Con. Jaders convention. What is it called? Jaders? Jaders. Yeah. Jason haters. Yeah. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2236.16s)]
*  I'd like to shout out my Jaders. They're just jokes, folks. I love you, Mark. I'm penny off. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2245.84s)]
*  Come on the pod, Zach. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2252.88s)]
*  I think somebody could launch a successful summit just doing that. It's like a ready-made [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2253.76s)]
*  audience and they're clearly passionate. All the YC founders will be there. Keynote day one, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2259.76s)]
*  Palmer Lucky. Keynote day two, David Sacks. I think it would rival the All In Summit in terms [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2268.0800000000004s)]
*  of the passion of the fans. All three of us would show up. J Cal would be so devastated. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2276.2400000000002s)]
*  Keynote. I think it's hilarious. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2280.8799999999997s)]
*  I like Benny off. I'm not trying to make any of you throw Benny off. He's just got to have a [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2288.8799999999997s)]
*  sense of humor. Oh my gosh. Megan Kelly. Megan Kelly and Palmer Lucky. Wait, does Zach hate you [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2293.4399999999996s)]
*  too? Why does Zach hate you? Oh my God. J Cal was just so- I was brutal to Zach in the early days. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2301.3599999999997s)]
*  Why? Well, he just- anyway, we'll get to it later. But you're right. Throwing a conference for [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2306.7200000000003s)]
*  J haters would just be- Jaders. That's like a ready-made- Jaders. Jaders. That is an underserved [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2311.44s)]
*  and passionate demographic. It would be bigger than 10. Passionate demographic. Just look at Zach's [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2316.88s)]
*  replies. Community with shared values. Hey, man, if I can get 25% of those tickets sales, I'm in. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2321.2000000000003s)]
*  Let's go. All right. Let's keep the train moving here. We have an update on the DOJ's antitrust [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2327.92s)]
*  suit with Google. Looks like they're going for the breakup as Chamath predicted. You remember [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2335.28s)]
*  the Bloomberg report back in August. We covered it in episode 192. Google was found liable for [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2342.7200000000003s)]
*  maintaining a monopoly in search and digital ads. Now the DOJ is working on the remedy, right? Okay. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2348.96s)]
*  They're guilty. So now comes time for the remedy. And the DOJ is quote, this is from Bloomberg, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2355.92s)]
*  considering asking a federal judge to force Google to sell off parts of its business. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2361.92s)]
*  And according to this filing, the DOJ is specifically considering structural remedies [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2366.96s)]
*  that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Google Play, that's the app store on [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2372.88s)]
*  Android, and Android itself. To advantage Google search, 32 page document released by the DOJ lays [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2378.0s)]
*  out several options and we'll go through them and talk about them here. The obvious one terminating [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2385.04s)]
*  Google's exclusive agreements with hardware companies like Apple, they're the default search [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2391.12s)]
*  engine there for 30 or 40 billion a year. Samsung, that's a layup. Separating Chrome and Android, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2395.68s)]
*  my God, that would be drastic ripping that out of the Google ecosystem, prohibiting certain kinds [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2401.04s)]
*  of data tracking. That's a layup as well, or other behavioral and structural changes for the company. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2406.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to pause there, Friedberg, and get your thoughts on this as a former Googler. And you [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2412.16s)]
*  interviewed Sergey at the summit, but I don't think we talked to Sergey about this because [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2417.52s)]
*  obviously he would not be able to talk about it. So what are your thoughts here on a potential remedy? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2422.4s)]
*  I think we've talked about this. I mean, look, I've shared in the past my belief that companies [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2427.7599999999998s)]
*  that are big, that have excess capital, that then invest that excess capital in R&D can be a net [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2433.84s)]
*  benefit for all of us. Look at Bell Labs. Bell Labs had a monopoly on through their association [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2439.52s)]
*  with AT&T, with developing radar, microwave, the transistor, integrated circuitry, information [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2447.28s)]
*  theory, everything that is the basis of the internet, computing, even nuclear technology, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2456.96s)]
*  and so on. It's because they had this extraordinary capital flow from the scale of the business and [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2463.52s)]
*  they were able to invest in R&D. Similarly, Google acquired and invested for many, many years in Deep [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2468.1600000000003s)]
*  Mind. And we just talked about how Demison team won the Nobel Prize for the work that they did. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2474.24s)]
*  And they, by the way, published the protein structure for 200 million proteins for free [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2480.3199999999997s)]
*  out of that service. I just want to zoom out for a minute and talk about the fact that this isn't [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2485.7599999999998s)]
*  about whether Google has a monopoly in search that prohibits competition or in ads that prohibits [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2490.7999999999997s)]
*  competition. But is it really worth penalizing any company that's big, particularly do we lose [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2498.24s)]
*  the benefit of those big companies investing in technology that pushes us forward? Google also [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2505.12s)]
*  invested in Waymo for years and years and years, which arguably spurned and drove investment from [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2509.52s)]
*  many other companies in self-driving technology. And if Google hadn't done that, would self-driving [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2515.9199999999996s)]
*  have taken off the way it did? I don't know. Same with Kitty Hawk and Larry's investment in [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2520.24s)]
*  Evytals, and that spawned a lot of Evytal investing. And similarly, if you think about [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2524.8s)]
*  Amazon and their investment in AWS, where they were burning cash for many years, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2529.84s)]
*  that turned out to spawn arguably a lot of interest and investment in cloud. And so I [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2534.88s)]
*  don't think that these big companies are bad just because they're big. I think we should take apart [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2541.04s)]
*  the monopolistic antitrust actions and behaviors that they take and then identify ways to remedy [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2545.44s)]
*  those behaviors versus just saying anyone or anything that's big should be taken apart [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2551.2799999999997s)]
*  because there is a tremendous benefit to be gained from the R&D dollars that they all put into [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2556.16s)]
*  things that move the whole industry forward. And I think that leadership's important to need it. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2561.04s)]
*  Otherwise, if you've got a bunch of startups that are trying to get $10 million checks from VCs, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2565.52s)]
*  I'm not sure they're going to build a Waymo and I'm not sure they're going to build [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2570.08s)]
*  Amazon Cloud. And I'm not sure they're going to build a DeepMind protein folding company and [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2573.2799999999997s)]
*  publish it for free. So I don't know, that's just my point of view. What's the likely outcome? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2578.4s)]
*  Chamath, you kind of nailed this one. Pretty good with these predictions. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2584.1600000000003s)]
*  Tell us we'll be sitting here five years from now, what will have occurred? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2588.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, not what Freebird just said. It'll be the opposite. There'll be some form of force [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2594.48s)]
*  remedy. I'm sympathetic to Freebird's argument. I don't think that it's really a good thing in the [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2600.64s)]
*  end because I do think there are some incredible examples of Google specifically reinvesting in a [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2605.44s)]
*  way that's really added value in the world. I think the problem though is that [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2612.88s)]
*  the technology innovation cycle has gotten too elongated. So you're not seeing [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2620.4s)]
*  creative destruction be the natural force that keeps all of these companies in their own swim [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2627.2000000000003s)]
*  lanes. And so they are allowed to become too amorphous and too profitable. And I think it [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2633.36s)]
*  becomes an obvious target for politicians. I think that's a really good observation there [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2640.48s)]
*  about the timeline of this because if you look at this, I have started now and I know many people [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2647.76s)]
*  are starting their search journey on Claude and chat GPT every day. I'm doing 30, 40, 50 queries [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2654.4s)]
*  and follow ups per day. I force my entire team to do that as well. And so just as there's an [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2660.88s)]
*  actual viable competitor to Google, this action has reached, I don't know, the halfway mark. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2668.0s)]
*  This is going to wind up being completely meaningless, Saks, if chat GPT does build a [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2674.32s)]
*  viable competitor coexistor that siphons off search. Am I wrong here? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2679.6s)]
*  Saks Well, it is ironic that frequently the government takes actions on these monopolies [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2684.88s)]
*  at precisely the moment they're subject to the greatest disruption. The same thing happened [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2692.96s)]
*  with Microsoft in a way, but it was still a good thing that the government acted when it did because [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2697.52s)]
*  there was a risk of Microsoft porting over its desktop monopoly into this new era of the internet. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2701.6800000000003s)]
*  I think it's still a good thing to be looking at breaking up Google. I actually think that would [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2707.92s)]
*  be good. At the end of the day, it might even be good for shareholders. This thing should be [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2711.2s)]
*  probably three separate companies like we've talked about on our previous show. But it is true that [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2715.2799999999997s)]
*  Google is facing the most existential threat to its search monopoly. And it is a monopoly [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2720.0s)]
*  in the form of open AI at this point in time. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2725.7599999999998s)]
*  Jeff I have one final thought here and piece of advice for Sergey and the team over there. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2729.52s)]
*  And when I told Sergey directly, they have to get good at making apps to go use chat GPT. You take [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2734.08s)]
*  out the app and it's a wonderful, beautiful experience. When you go try to figure out how [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2741.04s)]
*  to use Gemini. It's like shoehorned into search results. And then it's like some sub domain. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2745.84s)]
*  That's why people aren't using it. Go buy the domain in chat.com and make a dedicated app [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2751.44s)]
*  just for Gemini. Kick ass. You're 100% right. We suck at apps. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2756.4s)]
*  We said this when you asked about the bear case of open AI. If the DOJ is going to go after Google, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2762.7200000000003s)]
*  and by the way, the interesting thing, Jason, and I mentioned this to you is that in the same [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2771.84s)]
*  article that floated the trial balloon about this remedy of a Google breakup, the headline in the [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2776.6400000000003s)]
*  Wall Street Journal, which I think was very purposeful said Google and Meta. So I think that [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2781.92s)]
*  if given their druthers, they being the powers that be at Washington, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2787.76s)]
*  will probably want to take a run at both of these companies. They'll start with the one [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2792.4s)]
*  that they think they can disassemble the quickest, and then they'll go to Meta afterwards. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2796.32s)]
*  My strong advice to Meta and Google is if this is going to happen, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2802.88s)]
*  you got to go out kicking and punching and fighting and scratching. And I think the most [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2811.36s)]
*  obvious thing is what you just said, Jason, which is you are the front door through the internet. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2816.72s)]
*  And there is this completely new emergent technology. And where is the same response [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2822.8799999999997s)]
*  to chat GPT that you had to X or that you had to Snapchat or that you had to TikTok? Because if [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2830.56s)]
*  it's going to happen, it's going to happen. And then you might as well just go for it. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2838.3999999999996s)]
*  Build the apps, make them kick ass, make the chat GPT alternative and get it to billions of people [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2842.96s)]
*  yesterday. That would be the most logical game theory thing to do to build up a pool of users [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2850.08s)]
*  that you will rely on when the DOJ tries to come with some consent decree or whatnot. So this is [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2860.08s)]
*  the time to build up the assets now as aggressively as possible. Yeah. And selling YouTube would be [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2868.56s)]
*  the ultimate. I know that the ad networks you've pointed out for your blog are connected. But if [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2875.04s)]
*  they distribute in, they spun out YouTube. Can you imagine $500 billion going into Google's [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2879.36s)]
*  offers in YouTube shares? They would have $500 billion in cash, Chamath. I talked to a company, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2887.44s)]
*  a CEO of a public consumer facing company. And this was in the context of some 80, 90 stuff. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2895.52s)]
*  And he said that he and two other CEOs, the three of them, you guys would all know, these are very [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2903.92s)]
*  big companies, the three of them combined are particularly large. And they said they've had [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2911.52s)]
*  multi-year roadmaps to try to build a reasonable set of tools in advertising and it's been impossible. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2916.0s)]
*  And partly why is that the tools that the big folks offer are so good that they just cannibalize [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2923.28s)]
*  and run over the entire market. And so what they hear from CMOs is we would love to advertise on [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2930.2400000000002s)]
*  your company, your site, but A, your tools are substandard and B, even though your inventory [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2936.0800000000004s)]
*  is cheaper, you just don't give us the same scale and breadth that we get in these other big places. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2941.76s)]
*  I'm not saying that that's either right or wrong, but through the lens of probably what the DOJ sees [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2947.2s)]
*  is when a lot of these folks write letters to them talking about what they're going through, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2953.8399999999997s)]
*  this is what they're saying. And I suspect that if you could actually have [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2957.68s)]
*  a more fragmented market in some of these key markets, it's going to be a little bit easier [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2963.6s)]
*  for these smaller companies to have a business. Now you could say, well, tough luck, you tried [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2968.56s)]
*  and you couldn't build it. I get that argument. And I think that at some point that is legitimate, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2973.2s)]
*  but the problem is if you're public and you're trying to make your company profitable, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2977.6s)]
*  what do your engineers want to work on? They want to work on consumer facing forward features. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2981.68s)]
*  And so what always falls off the list, it's the stuff at the end. And so anyways, it's this [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2985.68s)]
*  recursive negative loop that a lot of these other companies are in, in the shadow of these big [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2991.2799999999997s)]
*  companies that I think is going to cause the DOJ to try to do something. You know, this is a great [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=2995.8399999999997s)]
*  setup for M&A, it's a great setup for IPOs starting to look like, and this is a multi [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3000.32s)]
*  administration case that's been going, right? I think this started under Trump, went into Biden, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3006.96s)]
*  and is now going to continue on to Trump or Harris. So what are your thoughts here, Sax? [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3012.1600000000003s)]
*  Sacks Well, in terms of the political [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3018.0s)]
*  environment for M&A next year? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so obviously depends which administrations in power. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3020.4s)]
*  A lot of Democrats, you know, prominent Democrats in tech like Mark Cuban or Reid Hoffman have been [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3025.44s)]
*  making the case that if Kamala is president, she's going to be much more hospitable and friendly [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3031.92s)]
*  towards M&A. And they've been saying explicitly that they want Lena Khan fired. Well, in response [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3038.4s)]
*  to that, AOC just came out and said, we're gonna have a throw down if you do that. So I don't, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3044.4s)]
*  I would not expect a substantial difference or improvement in the regulatory permissiveness [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3050.0800000000004s)]
*  towards M&A. If we have a democratic administration, if you have Trump in office next year, I think that [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3057.76s)]
*  there will be an opening up of M&A. I think the Republicans have their own issues with big tech. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3067.0400000000004s)]
*  But those issues tend to revolve around censorship and bias and search results and LLMs, things like [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3072.5600000000004s)]
*  that, as opposed to bigness per se. So I think it will be easier to get M&A done next year if you [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3078.88s)]
*  have a Republican administration. Absolutely. I am going to be printing money in a Trump administration. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3085.44s)]
*  It is going to be obscene how many M&A deals and IPOs are going to occur. There is such a huge backlog. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3090.96s)]
*  But I do think that I do think the Democrats want to get this moving as well. And I was talking to [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3098.4s)]
*  Reid Hoffman and you and Peter Thiel in the Illuminati meeting, and they voted 190 to 2 [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3102.72s)]
*  to replace Lena Conn in the Illuminati meeting. Chamath, why didn't you make the Illuminati meeting [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3109.6s)]
*  last week? I'm shocked that you weren't there. I'm not invited to that. People don't know that [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3113.7599999999998s)]
*  you're being facetious, Jason. Oh, really? They don't understand that I'm joking about the Illuminati? [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3118.48s)]
*  They often don't. They often don't. Well, I'm sorry to the low IQ listeners who don't know that [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3123.04s)]
*  the Illuminati is not real. Oh, now you're insulting the audience? No, I'm insulting the [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3130.0s)]
*  ones who believe there's an Illuminati. He's trying to sell tickets to the Jaders. I'm trying [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3133.84s)]
*  to sell tickets to the Jaders ball. But buck nasty, suck nasty. Jane Cowell is the biggest [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3138.4s)]
*  hater in the tech industry. You ever see the haters ball, Sax? I have not seen that. Chappell [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3146.0s)]
*  show? No. Chamath, it looks like between the time we mentioned it on the pod, it's actually [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3152.16s)]
*  happening. Here it is. The Jaders ball is happening. There it is. Lena Conn, David Sax. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3157.6s)]
*  Why am I there? Well, because you're a headliner. You're organizing. I think you're the host. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3163.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm going to be a keynote? You're the MC. Okay, wow. I'm the MC. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3167.92s)]
*  Look, there's suck nasty and there's Palmer Lucky. You guys don't know this bit from Chappell? [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3173.2799999999997s)]
*  The haters ball from Chappell? Oh my God. It's the funniest bit on Chappell show. It's literally- [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3179.68s)]
*  I mean, I saw a lot of Chappell show. I don't remember. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3186.8s)]
*  Just show the real picture, Nick. On the Chappell show, they have all of these pimps who have a [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3189.2000000000003s)]
*  yearly convention, which is their player haters. I've seen this. I've seen it. All they do is sit [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3196.1600000000003s)]
*  there with like a toothpick in and they hate on each other and make fun of each other. I've seen [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3200.88s)]
*  this. It is the funniest bit in the history of the Chappell show. All right, let's keep the train [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3205.28s)]
*  moving here. CRV is giving back or maybe not calling down $275 million from their LPs. Charles [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3210.56s)]
*  River Ventures, shout out to my pal, George Zachary and Greek brother from CRV. Historically, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3216.96s)]
*  they invest in early stage startups. They did DoorDash, Airtable, Twitter back in the day. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3221.92s)]
*  They had two funds that they raised back in 2022, a billion dollar early stage fund and a 500 [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3227.12s)]
*  million growth fund. Sometimes people call that an opportunity fund or a select fund. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3231.7599999999998s)]
*  The New York Times reported CRV is going to give back about half of that $275 million to investors [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3236.8799999999997s)]
*  or technically probably not call it down. The four partners at CRV gave an exclusive to the New York [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3242.4799999999996s)]
*  Times. So either getting ahead of this story or maybe, you know, who knows what the motivation [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3248.9599999999996s)]
*  here is. But the reason they gave is that the market conditions for late stage have worsened [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3253.4399999999996s)]
*  dramatically and that the valuations are still too high. Yes, the rent is too high and that there [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3258.56s)]
*  aren't any exit options as we just talked about with the administration, no IPOs, no M&A. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3264.08s)]
*  And that VC map doesn't work in the late stage. So I'll just stop there. There's a bunch of other [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3269.84s)]
*  notes here. Obviously, this isn't the first time this has happened. I think Founders Fund cut the [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3275.2s)]
*  size of its eighth fund in half from 1.8 billion to 900 million. They didn't actually give the [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3279.6s)]
*  capital back to VCs like they're saying CRV did here. Again, I'm not certain if that's what's [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3284.4s)]
*  happened or not. They put the extra 900 million into its ninth fund if they decide to raise that, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3289.04s)]
*  which I'm assuming Founders Fund will. Chamath, do you have any thoughts on this? [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3294.48s)]
*  I guess we had two stories here. So I don't know if it meets the trend or not. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3299.7599999999998s)]
*  Peter Thiel did this and he gave back quite a large piece of his fund a couple of years ago [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3303.92s)]
*  and then CRV just did it. I want to make sure I get the citation right. I think it was Thomas [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3309.2799999999997s)]
*  Lafont at CO2 who said this. It was really powerful. It made a huge impression on me, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3314.56s)]
*  which is that the NASDAQ creates about $800 billion of enterprise value a year. And he brought that up [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3319.2799999999997s)]
*  in the context of private markets have to exceed that in order for it to be a real viable alternative [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3327.68s)]
*  to just owning public indices. And so if you factor in the liquidity risk and the duration, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3333.2s)]
*  you have to probably generate, I don't know, a trillion, $1.2 trillion of enterprise value [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3339.68s)]
*  in private tech every year. That just seems like it's really hard to do. Where is all of [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3345.44s)]
*  that value getting created? So I think that venture needs to go through a phase where it [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3350.4s)]
*  re-rationalizes. This is sort of what I said at David's LP Day, which is I think that [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3356.64s)]
*  LPs have made a couple of very big mistakes. And I think the biggest mistake that they've made is by [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3362.0s)]
*  smearing too much money across too many general partners. And I think if you had to redo it, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3368.16s)]
*  A, it's probably a lot less money in total. But B, and the example I gave there was instead of [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3374.48s)]
*  giving $50 million to Kraft and $10 million to somebody else, you're better off giving [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3380.48s)]
*  $60 million to Kraft and not even having that other GP. Because that GP makes everybody's [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3384.96s)]
*  life complicated. They overpay, they mispay, they're probably not supposed to be a GP in the first [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3390.3199999999997s)]
*  place. And so they force returns down. And then when you contrast that again to a public market [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3395.68s)]
*  that is systematically creating $800 billion of enterprise value a year, this is an incredibly [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3401.28s)]
*  tough game and it's getting much, much harder. So I think that if you just take a step back, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3408.56s)]
*  these are the right things to do because you're much better off having a smaller pool of capital [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3413.6s)]
*  that you can concentrate into the things that matter. You're probably better off having smaller [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3419.2000000000003s)]
*  teams versus bigger teams. And you're probably better off trying to forge LP relationships where [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3423.8399999999997s)]
*  they're not doing 50 fund investments because it just makes the entire industry lag, public liquid [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3431.52s)]
*  alternatives. And I think that that's just not good. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3439.92s)]
*  Peanut butter getting spread a little bit then there. Any thoughts, Freeberg, on this trend, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3442.3199999999997s)]
*  this trend, if we can call it that, or is this like maybe they're reacting, right as the market [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3449.12s)]
*  is changing and valuations are getting more reasonable and the exit opportunities are getting [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3455.7599999999998s)]
*  more reasonable. It seems like this was the right reaction two years ago, but maybe it's the wrong [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3460.3199999999997s)]
*  reaction now. What do you think, Freeberg? For a venture firm to return capital, they need [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3464.3999999999996s)]
*  to have at least one or two big winners. And so if that winner needs to be a 10x or 20x or 30x [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3470.16s)]
*  of the fund, because most of the investments in the fund are not going to work, you need to be [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3477.36s)]
*  able to enter at a reasonable price and there needs to be enough opportunity relative to the capital [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3483.52s)]
*  trying to invest in that opportunity out there for it to make sense. So in a market where there is [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3489.6800000000003s)]
*  excess venture capital, where valuations are at a premium, and where you don't see the exit path, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3493.6000000000004s)]
*  the M&A or the IPO events that make sense that you can actually realize that model, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3501.0400000000004s)]
*  you should take less capital and make fewer, surer investments. And I think that that's what [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3505.92s)]
*  some folks have realized. They don't want to be chasing, you know, highly valued inflated [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3512.56s)]
*  opportunities. And they don't want to be putting capital into tier B or tier C opportunities, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3517.84s)]
*  just for the sake of deploying capital. This is a really interesting moment where you can kind of see [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3524.64s)]
*  who are the right folks in terms of thinking long term in Silicon Valley, long term in terms of [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3530.32s)]
*  building an investment practice and private venture. And maybe who are folks that are trying [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3535.12s)]
*  to build their AUM stack. And folks who have done reasonably well, like Founders Fund has probably [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3541.36s)]
*  the most exceptional track record in Silicon Valley as a venture firm. They are very cognizant [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3546.0s)]
*  of the market conditions. And I think that they're being very smart. By the way, the other thing I've [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3551.92s)]
*  heard from LPs is they're similarly trying to find more concentrated capital themselves. So [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3556.24s)]
*  they're trying to put more capital to work in fewer managers. And so there's a real weed from [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3562.9599999999996s)]
*  the shaft moment happening in Silicon Valley venture right now. What I think a couple years ago [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3569.6s)]
*  was, hey, everyone's going to go do a startup. A few years ago became everyone's going to go do [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3574.3199999999997s)]
*  a venture fund. And now I think the froth that has occurred because of that is being cleared up. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3578.24s)]
*  And to just explain this math before I get Sax's thoughts on this, if this was a $500 million fund, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3582.64s)]
*  let's say they were putting $25 million into each, I will take management fees out of it, [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3588.96s)]
*  $25 million into each opportunity at a billion dollar valuation, they would own two and a half [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3594.16s)]
*  percent obviously of those firms, they need to get probably a $30 billion power law exit, a 30X [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3598.4s)]
*  X in order to just return the fund. There'll be some dilution obviously along the way. That's why [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3607.12s)]
*  it's not 20X. And the number of companies that go from a billion to 30 billion per cycle is [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3611.92s)]
*  incredibly low. Uber, Coinbase, Airbnb. It's a really short list, Sax in recent history. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3619.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, just to go back to the CRV thing, you said at the [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3627.76s)]
*  outset of the conversation that this was either a growth fund or an opportunities fund. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3633.04s)]
*  That makes a really big difference. Explain, please. Because, well, an opportunities fund [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3637.84s)]
*  typically exists to back up your winners. In other words, if the venture fund is producing [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3642.8s)]
*  some big winners, the opportunities fund exists to deploy more capital into those companies, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3649.28s)]
*  as opposed to a growth fund, which is you'd be underwriting brand new companies from scratch. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3655.28s)]
*  Typically, an opportunities fund is limited to companies that you're already an investor in [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3659.6800000000003s)]
*  through your venture fund. So that makes a big difference. I mean, if CRV has a billion dollar [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3662.8s)]
*  venture fund and only a $500 million opportunities fund, it may just be the case that they don't need [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3667.92s)]
*  all of that capital to back up the winners. They can do their prorata's out of the main fund. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3673.2000000000003s)]
*  So I suspect that that might be what's going on. I actually think this is a pretty good time to [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3678.2400000000002s)]
*  have a growth fund. Why? Well, because a lot of the crossover capital has left the ecosystem. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3683.52s)]
*  A few years ago- The Tigers and that sort of cohort, Softbank, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3690.72s)]
*  Masayoshi-san. Yeah. Well, Tiger and Softbank are still around, but there are other very large [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3694.0s)]
*  investors, hedge funds and so on, who had come into the ecosystem of billions of dollars a few [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3701.8399999999997s)]
*  years ago. And now they've left. And some of those funds that you're talking about, like Tiger used [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3706.0s)]
*  to be $10 billion funds, now they're $2 billion funds. Right. They've been right sized. They're [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3710.56s)]
*  not violently doing... I mean, the Tiger deal is my understanding was they weren't joining the board [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3713.8399999999997s)]
*  in a lot of the cases and they were outsourcing the diligence and that was a pretty violent pace. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3718.8s)]
*  Yeah. This is the best time in probably five years to have a growth fund. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3723.6800000000003s)]
*  Interesting. But to your point about the size of the venture fund, the bigger the venture fund, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3727.44s)]
*  the bigger the winner that you need to make that pay off, obviously. And so because of the power [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3731.76s)]
*  loss, so to take an example, I don't know, let's say you've got a billion dollar venture fund. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3737.2000000000003s)]
*  Let's say that at IPO, you own 10% of whatever that winner is. And because of the power law, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3742.1600000000003s)]
*  your fund performance is really determined by your best outcome. Right? [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3749.84s)]
*  Yep. So in order to take a $1 billion venture fund and say deliver a 3X, so 3 billion of returns, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3753.84s)]
*  and your best company you own 10% of, that implies you have a $30 billion [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3762.4s)]
*  winner in that fund. And there are precious few outcomes where you have a $30 billion IPO. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3767.44s)]
*  Right? Yeah. I mean, count them on two hands the last cycle. Like I just did. You got Uber, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3774.88s)]
*  you got Robinhood, you got Coinbase, Stripe will eventually come out, you got SpaceX. Well, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3781.36s)]
*  that was two cycles ago. So I mean... Yeah. You're going to need to have a meaningful [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3787.92s)]
*  ownership position and a massive company in order to make a fund that big payoff. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3790.7999999999997s)]
*  The data that I think LPs look at shows that smaller venture funds tend to perform better [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3794.96s)]
*  for this reason. 500, 600 million dollars funds. So yeah, I personally wouldn't want the pressure [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3800.56s)]
*  of a billion dollar venture fund. That would be really hard. As a five or $600 billion venture [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3806.64s)]
*  fund, you kind of need to have or want to have like a dekakorn outcome to make that a great fund, [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3812.7999999999997s)]
*  but to have to have a $30 billion plus outcome, it's even more difficult. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3819.8399999999997s)]
*  Moving on, Pew just published some really interesting research on TikTok. If you don't [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3824.08s)]
*  know the Pew study, they've been doing it for decades. It's very well respected and bipartisan [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3828.72s)]
*  or nonpartisan. Four in 10 US adults aged 18 to 29 are now regularly getting their news from TikTok. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3834.48s)]
*  Here's some charts for you to take a look at. As you can see, the younger generation is really [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3841.7599999999998s)]
*  spending a lot of time on TikTok and getting a lot of their news there. I know this because [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3846.88s)]
*  yeah, I've talked to a bunch of kids about this and people that use TikTok, 52% are regularly [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3851.84s)]
*  getting their news from the platform and that number has skyrocketed compared to other social [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3858.32s)]
*  platforms. Take a look at this chart. Here's X, 59% of people say they get their news at X. It's [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3864.1600000000003s)]
*  really a news platform, so that makes total sense. You look at Facebook, it's 48% right now. Reddit, [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3869.6800000000003s)]
*  33%. YouTube, 37%. In 2024, Instagram, 40%. But TikTok, 52%, up from 22%. So it's no longer [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3876.24s)]
*  just dancing and this is the reason I think many people in the government were concerned about [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3884.9599999999996s)]
*  the attack vector that the CCP would have in the United States since they still control the company [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3891.2799999999997s)]
*  for services like Snapchat, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp. And Nextdoor, it's below 30% get their news from [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3897.6s)]
*  there. There's your Truth Social there, Sax, 57% of people get news there and Rumble, 48%. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3905.36s)]
*  So what's your takeaway from this, just Sax, looking at it and this impact that TikTok has [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3910.64s)]
*  is this concerning on a national security level since the algorithm's a black box and you could [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3917.7599999999998s)]
*  tweak it if you really wanted to to really change sentiment and young people are obviously very [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3922.72s)]
*  impressionable on this platform and they're big users of it. Well, I thought there was other data [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3928.72s)]
*  in the study that should calm people's fears that TikTok would somehow be used as a political weapon. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3934.4s)]
*  So in the same survey you're talking about, 95% of adults that use TikTok say they use it because [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3940.1600000000003s)]
*  it's entertaining. So that's the main reason people use it and only 10% of accounts followed [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3946.56s)]
*  by US adults post content related to political or social issues. Okay, that's posting and the main [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3952.64s)]
*  reason, right? Yeah, but so basically 90% of the accounts that get followed aren't even posting [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3958.32s)]
*  political or social issues. They're there for entertainment as people watching dance videos, [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3964.8s)]
*  as people watching. I mean, the main thing I use it for is to watch [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3970.32s)]
*  wrestling highlights. So you're a wrestling guy? Yeah, I'm a wrestling fan. What? Yeah. You're into [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3976.4s)]
*  this Kabuki theater of wrestling? This is new information. I get my WWE on TikTok. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3983.44s)]
*  Because I don't have to watch those. Yeah. Who's your favorite? Are you a Hulk Hogan guy? Are you [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3991.44s)]
*  an Undertaker guy? Vince McMahon? Jimmy Superfly Snuka. Who? You Andre the guy? The crazy thing is I [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=3994.96s)]
*  know all those names. I also love the Road Warriors. Ultimate Warrior I loved. I was a huge [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4002.08s)]
*  wrestling fan. That was the one thing that my dad and I bonded over. We would watch wrestling every [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4008.48s)]
*  Saturday. Sax, did you ever watch the specials on Saturday night? Oh, yeah. Oh, those are so great. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4014.4s)]
*  That was the era of Hulk Hogan. For sure. Saturday night's main event. Randy Marchland Savage. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4020.88s)]
*  Savage is great. Yeah. I mean, look, my all time favorite was Stone Cold Steve Austin. Stone Cold [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4026.2400000000002s)]
*  is great. I marked out the hardest for Austin. He was anti woke before anti woke became a thing. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4031.92s)]
*  Totally. This is crazy. You guys are into wrestling. I'd say Flair is number two for me. Wait, [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4036.96s)]
*  wait, hold on. Have you gone to a wrestling event? Did you only like the WWF at the time or did you [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4044.56s)]
*  like the NWA? That their moments when when Hogan turned heel and joined the the was it the NWO? [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4050.24s)]
*  That was like a big moment. I'm a big Andy Kaufman wrestling fan. That was my only interest is when [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4059.12s)]
*  Andy Kaufman came in there and trolled them. But yeah, Andy Kaufman. Yeah, that was like in the [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4064.08s)]
*  1970s. Wasn't it? Or it was the late 80s. Remember, he was on David Letterman with Jerry Waller. And [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4071.2799999999997s)]
*  he comes to a wrestling match sacks in the south. And he gets in there. I grew up in my hometown in [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4079.12s)]
*  Memphis. Right. So he goes there. And he gets in the ring. And he says, all of you rednecks, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4085.04s)]
*  I want to show you some new inventions. This is called soap. And this is called the washcloth. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4091.52s)]
*  And you use it to clean yourself. And he's like just mocking the southern accent and Jerry Lala. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4098.4s)]
*  Remember Jerry Lala smacks him and on Letterman. Oh, it's the great it was a huge deal. I mean, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4105.28s)]
*  where I grew up because that this was like on the local news. Yes. When I grew up in Memphis, [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4111.28s)]
*  there was no professional sports teams. Okay, all we had was the Memphis State basketball. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4116.5599999999995s)]
*  And, and wrestling every Monday night, the Mid-South Coliseum. That was it. That was like [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4122.16s)]
*  professional sports. And you also had probably like some state fairs or, you know, like best goats, [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4127.36s)]
*  best sheep or something. Lawler was so popular that he could have been elected mayor. In fact, [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4133.52s)]
*  I think there was talk at one point of him becoming mayor. Wow. I mean, the intergender [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4139.360000000001s)]
*  champion Andy Kaufman. Did you guys like mouth of the south? Jimmy Hart. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he was [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4144.0s)]
*  amazing. He was like the main heel manager for a while. Yeah. Okay. For the WWE took over, I guess [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4150.400000000001s)]
*  it's called WWF back then. But there are all these little fiefdoms and kingdoms and Mid-South [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4157.200000000001s)]
*  wrestling was like one of those kingdoms. And Lawler was like the king of it. And then you had [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4162.56s)]
*  all these guys come in and out and wrestle. Friedberg, you ever watch wrestling? And what [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4166.64s)]
*  do you think of this TikTok survey? I don't watch wrestling. Okay, very good. And TikTok survey, [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4172.320000000001s)]
*  anything where you know, any thoughts? Looks like they gathered some reasonable data. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4178.240000000001s)]
*  Okay, there you go. There's there's your hard hitting point. My point was that it's mostly [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4182.96s)]
*  an entertainment app where people go to watch dance videos, wrestling clips, style influencers, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4187.52s)]
*  and so on. And I think that this idea that it's somehow a propaganda tool around, you know, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4192.8s)]
*  programming our youth, I think that's a moral panic that's been exaggerated. What do you think [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4198.320000000001s)]
*  the odds are that TikTok is hacked to allow you to passively listen even when the app is not being [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4202.72s)]
*  used? Zero. You think it's definitively zero? No, like 5%. I think that's right. Yeah. Because [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4208.72s)]
*  someone said that that was that was a there was some code that enabled that in the early version [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4217.76s)]
*  of the app. And then some other people audited it. And they said they did not find evidence that [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4224.48s)]
*  there was any technology. And Apple's got a very good audit system for this. Did those same people [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4228.48s)]
*  audit WhatsApp? And then it turned out that it was passively listen. Yeah, the WhatsApp passively [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4232.4s)]
*  listen. It's one of the it's one of the most well known breaches. Well, maybe they do. Maybe it's [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4238.88s)]
*  100% certain that the CCP is using it because they this people have tracked already journalists [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4243.84s)]
*  using it. So if they've already done it, it's 100%. And I don't know about the passive listening, [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4249.2s)]
*  but any thoughts on 50% plus of young people getting their news here? Chema, any news on that? [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4252.96s)]
*  I mean, obviously, we don't have evidence that it's being used currently to manipulate people. But [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4258.16s)]
*  it's over 50% of young people are now getting their news there, or say they're getting their news. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4262.64s)]
*  I bet I've had more than 50% of young people are getting their news from podcasts. And those [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4266.8s)]
*  podcasts get chopped up and clipped. And then people watch them on TikTok. Yeah, for sure. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4270.96s)]
*  That's how it's happening. There are a lot of people who think this show is a TikTok show. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4275.76s)]
*  They don't know it's a big show. We'll have to prepare for [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4280.96s)]
*  a brave new world in the following way. There was an article, I think it was in the Wall Street [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4284.96s)]
*  Journal that said that Russia and Iran were paying low level street criminals to create chaos. Okay, [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4289.28s)]
*  and I read that article and I thought, okay, well, what does this mean if you actually [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4298.0s)]
*  extrapolate this, which is that the hot wars are very complicated, not worth doing. These [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4302.240000000001s)]
*  disruptive fissures are the better way to sow chaos. And it occurred to me then that tying [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4311.280000000001s)]
*  this back to something that we saw before, it does make sense for a lot of folks to sponsor a lot of [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4317.92s)]
*  long tail content that say a lot of different things. I think that that just is pretty obvious. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4323.68s)]
*  And so I think that if you put these two ideas together, it stands to reason that a lot of people [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4329.92s)]
*  will be paying influencers a lot of money to create all kinds of content that is specific to [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4336.72s)]
*  a perspective that they have. And then on top of that, if you can algorithmically amplify one over [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4343.12s)]
*  the other, you're going to have issues. Is it the biggest issue in the world? Probably not. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4347.52s)]
*  But it's probably a thing. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4354.08s)]
*  It probably wouldn't swing an election, but it would cause chaos. And we just had the [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4355.6s)]
*  Southern District of New York target that Russian. Russia Today was giving $10 million to four [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4359.68s)]
*  podcasters. They didn't even know they were getting paid by the Russians. They just picked [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4366.64s)]
*  them because they liked their opinions. And they gave them $100,000 an episode to promote [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4369.360000000001s)]
*  pro-Russian positions. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4374.64s)]
*  If the Russians were actually doing it, it's the stupidest use of $10 million ever, because [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4376.72s)]
*  those podcasters already had their own channels. They're already putting out lots of content. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4382.719999999999s)]
*  And this other content is a drop in the bucket. I think, Jamath, the issue with what you're saying [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4386.4s)]
*  is just there is so much content out there already. People create it for free. People create it [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4390.4s)]
*  because they have a career in it. There's a whole long tail of influencers. There is so [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4396.719999999999s)]
*  much content out there already through podcasts, through websites. It's all being chopped up. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4402.32s)]
*  Trying to do it as some sort of disinformation strategy, I think, is very hard to do because [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4407.92s)]
*  it's just when there's billions and billions of impressions, any effort that you try to engineer [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4413.04s)]
*  ends up just being a drop in the bucket. It makes sense in theory. It's very hard to do in practice. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4419.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. The goal is not to win any specific argument. It's to create mistrust in the entire [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4427.52s)]
*  news ecosystem, in the information system, so that people give up trying to figure out what [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4435.44s)]
*  the truth is. And that's what the Russians and the KGB- [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4440.08s)]
*  I think the mainstream media is doing that on their own. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4442.16s)]
*  Yeah. You could argue that, sure. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4444.32s)]
*  The mainstream media lies so much as it's creating the distrust. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4444.799999999999s)]
*  As are the Russians paying off podcasters. Okay. Let's give- [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4448.08s)]
*  How is $10 million going to accomplish anything if that story's even true? [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4451.12s)]
*  Oh, very simple. Great question. Great question. May I answer it? [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4454.24s)]
*  It's a great question. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4458.879999999999s)]
*  It's a conspiracy theory. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4459.36s)]
*  Not a conspiracy theory at all. These were very low-level, mid-tier B, CD podcasters. If you give [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4460.72s)]
*  them $100,000 per episode, they can spend more money buying cameras, promoting their shows, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4467.360000000001s)]
*  hiring people. So you're just finding people and dropping money on their heads so they can do more [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4473.2s)]
*  of the same. So it's a very smart strategy, in fact, I think. I think it's the stupidest thing [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4477.52s)]
*  I've ever heard. They took podcasters who were already successful and paid them to release content [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4481.84s)]
*  through a less watched channel. That's the- Yes. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4486.88s)]
*  It was just more about getting the money to produce more content. And then they- [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4490.24s)]
*  These guys are already live streaming 24-7. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4493.84s)]
*  Oh, there's your puppy. Oh, here he goes. Freeberg trying to win more people over with [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4498.64s)]
*  his puppy love. Unbelievable. This guy is absolutely ridiculous. Unbelievable. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4503.12s)]
*  All right. Listen, let me give Sac some red meat here. He got his little steak ta-ta with my Russia [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4510.96s)]
*  Today story. You got your little amused bouche. And now I give you your tomahawk. You ready, [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4516.56s)]
*  Sac? You want your tomahawk? You want it rare? Here it comes. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4521.52s)]
*  2024 election update. The betting markets and polling indicate a really tight race, but [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4525.52s)]
*  maybe Trump is surging this week. Polymarket, which is a betting market, has Trump 55 to 45 [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4531.4400000000005s)]
*  versus Kamala. Kalshi, another betting market, 52-48 Trump. Bavada and Pointsbet, those are [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4537.84s)]
*  offshore booking, and Polymarket is also offshore. 52-48 Trump. Nate Silver, friend of the pod. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4545.44s)]
*  His algorithm has it 53-47. Kamala, real clear polling. That's an algorithm, has Kamala with [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4552.24s)]
*  a two-point lead. New York Times, Sienna, Kamala with a three-point lead. Reuters, Ipsos, [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4559.839999999999s)]
*  pretty well trusted three-point lead for Kamala. NPR PBS, MaristPoll has Kamala with a two-point [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4565.12s)]
*  lead. So, sportbooks and betting markets are favoring Trump slightly, while the polls are [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4572.16s)]
*  slightly favoring Kamala. Sacs, I sliced it up nice for you. You got nice 10 slices of meat here. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4579.12s)]
*  Which slice are you going for? Well, I think your recitation of the polls there kind of mixes up a [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4586.4s)]
*  couple of things. There's popular vote polls, and then there's electoral college, which goes [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4592.96s)]
*  there by state. If you look at pretty much now all the main pollsters, you look at Tony Fabrizio, [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4596.8s)]
*  you look at Real Clear Politics, they're now showing that Trump is winning the electoral [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4602.88s)]
*  college right now. He is up in almost every swing state, including, I think, Michigan, [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4607.52s)]
*  which is pretty surprising. Clearly, there's been a huge swing towards Trump over the last [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4612.8s)]
*  week or two. And look, there's still 25 days to go, so anything can happen. I don't want to [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4617.84s)]
*  overstate this, but yeah, this is a good example right here showing that Trump is now leading [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4621.76s)]
*  every swing state. I think the electoral college is 296 to 242. What is Fabrizio? [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4626.0s)]
*  He's just a Republican pollster, but his accuracy is pretty high. I've never heard of Fabrizio. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4631.04s)]
*  Well, another guy who I think is more neutral is Mark Halprid, who is a pundit who has been very [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4636.320000000001s)]
*  accurate this election cycle. Remember, he's the one who broke the scoop that Biden would be [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4642.72s)]
*  replaced by Harris, and he even said exactly when it would happen. And he predicted it down [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4647.12s)]
*  to the day. He was exactly right about that. And if you follow his account, he is now saying that both [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4653.84s)]
*  Republican and Democrat insiders that he talks to are both saying the same thing, [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4660.96s)]
*  which is their internals are now showing Trump ahead in every swing state or almost every swing [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4665.44s)]
*  state. And things seem to be breaking Trump's way right now. Again, there's 25 days left. But [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4671.6s)]
*  if you're wondering why is Harris all of a sudden doing interviews, it's because their internals [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4677.6s)]
*  started showing that she was in trouble. So they decided to get her out more. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4682.72s)]
*  Or is it the other way? Is it that her Howard Stern interviews or whatever are causing her to lose [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4686.96s)]
*  votes? Well, yeah, exactly. Which one is it? Because I don't know when, I don't have the dates [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4692.4800000000005s)]
*  of all these polls versus that. No, I think it's what I predicted a couple of months ago. It's the [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4696.96s)]
*  doom loop. So what I said two months ago is that if Harris gets behind, she's gonna have to abandon [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4701.12s)]
*  this sort of basement strategy of not doing interviews, she has to start doing interviews. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4706.8s)]
*  The problem is she's not good at interviews. And if she does more interviews, she's going to fall [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4710.8s)]
*  further behind in the polls, and it could cause a doom loop. So that's where we appear to be right [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4714.24s)]
*  now. I said that on August 30. Okay. Chamath, you know that's? I think that Donald Trump has basically [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4719.04s)]
*  stuck to his strategy, which is he is a generational retail politician. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4725.52s)]
*  I just heard parts of what he did with Andrew Schultz. Another great sort of podcast. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4734.4800000000005s)]
*  I think David's right that the editing and the massaging of the Kamala Harris talking points [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4742.4800000000005s)]
*  are galvanizing the people that have already decided and turning off the people that have [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4750.0s)]
*  already decided to vote for Trump, and she's losing the folks in the middle. And so this is [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4754.88s)]
*  what's causing her to have to be out there. And she's going to have to deliver a very crisp [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4759.84s)]
*  message. And I think that right now, it's been a little bit lacking, which is why you're seeing [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4766.72s)]
*  the polls, at least the electoral college, which is really what matters at this point turn Trump. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4771.2s)]
*  So she's going to have a bit of an uphill fight between here and November. The other thing I'll [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4779.28s)]
*  say is that if you've seen what's happening in the appellate court, it's not clear whether the Trump [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4783.92s)]
*  case is going to get overturned before the election. But if that does, [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4791.2s)]
*  that could be very meaningful momentum for him. And then I think the third thing is that we should [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4795.36s)]
*  now buckle in because if the last two elections are any guide, there are going to be a bunch [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4801.12s)]
*  of spanners in the works between now and November. Wait, what did you say? Spanners? [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4808.96s)]
*  Spanners in the works. Yeah. What does it mean? What do you call it? Wrench in the system? [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4813.6s)]
*  You mean like an October surprise? You mean like some crazy turn of events? Okay. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4817.360000000001s)]
*  Freeberg, any thoughts here? Would you like to rush on test this and see what you want in the [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4822.160000000001s)]
*  numbers? Or do you have some objective thoughts here? What's your what's your take? [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4826.64s)]
*  You know, there's a polling data? Or Yeah, where we're at in the election, you're pretty open ended [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4832.88s)]
*  here. You can look at the you can make a note on overall what you see between the betting markets [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4837.76s)]
*  and the polls and that disparity. You could just talk generally about where you think we are. You [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4844.320000000001s)]
*  can talk about Kamala on Howard Stern and doing a bunch of interviews with friendlies. Where are [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4849.4400000000005s)]
*  you at right now? I didn't see her interviews. Okay. I saw some excerpts on Twitter. Oh, boy. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4854.72s)]
*  Yeah. Let me just follow up on a point. Jamal made Jamal said that she had to be crisp. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4861.2s)]
*  If you look at any of these interviews are the opposite of crisp. She's asked softball questions [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4865.52s)]
*  by by like Stephen Colbert saying, Why are you running for president? How are you different than [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4869.68s)]
*  Joe Biden? Yeah. And she doesn't have good answers. She starts free associating. She gives these very [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4874.08s)]
*  long winded answers that don't go anywhere. She says you can't think of a single way she's [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4880.0s)]
*  different than Joe Biden when when pushed on that. It's very strange. These are the most favorite [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4884.64s)]
*  shows. I wish she would do some challenging shows. I think she's got to do Joe Rogan, [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4890.8s)]
*  all in. And what would be another good podcast for her to do at your mouth if she really wanted to [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4894.56s)]
*  like do the adversarial thing or something? Just come to all in, come and have a conversation, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4900.16s)]
*  come and have a normal conversation here. Yeah. No, I'm just thinking like, it seems like sex, [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4906.88s)]
*  if she comes in, has a has a conversation, you'll be respectful. Yeah. This whole idea that I didn't [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4912.64s)]
*  treat Cuban respectfully is nonsense. Just watch the tape. I don't keep all that. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4918.72s)]
*  Somebody asserted that. No, I mean, the all of you look back on every single presidential related [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4924.400000000001s)]
*  one we did here, they were all respectful. And they were all conversations. I think the Cuban [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4931.92s)]
*  one dipped because of both of you into a bit more of a debate. And it was a lot more crossover than [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4936.4800000000005s)]
*  the other one. That's what I agree back to him. He likes to come out. He likes to do his thing. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4940.88s)]
*  That's exactly what you look at all the other ones. I'm trying to think of a moment where it, [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGKw62LAzM&t=4947.84s)]
