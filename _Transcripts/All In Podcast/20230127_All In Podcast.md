# E113 DOJ tries to break up Google, vaccine questions, Ukraine escalation & more
**All In Podcast:** [January 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s)
*  Saxie boo, how much heat and momentum is Nikki Haley gotten this week? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=0.0s)]
*  Oh my god, stop trying to make Nikki Haley happen. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3.24s)]
*  Fetch is not happening. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=6.72s)]
*  Stop trying to make Fetch happen. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=7.88s)]
*  Stop trying to make Fetch happen. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=9.28s)]
*  It's happening. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=10.8s)]
*  Is it happening because it's a bomb? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=11.8s)]
*  This is like my long Google short Facebook spread trade of last year. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=14.26s)]
*  It's happening. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=19.0s)]
*  Fetch is not happening. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=20.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=21.0s)]
*  Stop trying to make Fetch happen. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=22.0s)]
*  Just as a programming note, we did a Twitter survey and you selected Sax as the person [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=23.0s)]
*  you wanted to moderate the pod most next. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  So welcome to Fox News Sunday. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=48.32s)]
*  And here's your host, David Sax. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=52.12s)]
*  You're really chafed about this, aren't you, J. Cal? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=54.96s)]
*  No, I'm excited for it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=57.0s)]
*  I'm so excited. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=58.6s)]
*  Just to save a keyboard warrior the time. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=60.16s)]
*  I will never ever, ever moderate this thing. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=63.2s)]
*  So I'm here to talk. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=67.38s)]
*  All right, three, two, welcome to the all in pod. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=68.88s)]
*  I am your host, the Rain Man, David Sax, the famous doomsday clock that atomic scientists [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=72.28s)]
*  used to measure the threat of nuclear annihilation has never been closer to midnight, not even [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=77.39999999999999s)]
*  during the Cold War. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=81.6s)]
*  But since the besties think it's more important to discuss their stock portfolios, we're going [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=82.6s)]
*  to save Ukraine for later in the show. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=86.96s)]
*  Priorities, right, gentlemen? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  And why not? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  Who says you can't take it with you? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  The dictator, Chamath Paliha-Patiya, is planning to be entombed with his money like an Egyptian [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=93.32s)]
*  pharaoh and with his sweaters too, even though it certainly won't be cold where he's going. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  And of course, he'll throw in the world's greatest moderator, Jason Calcantes, in the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=102.32s)]
*  tomb to be his servant in the afterlife. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=106.96s)]
*  It's the role Jake has been preparing for all his life by sucking up to every tech founder [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=109.6s)]
*  and VC you can get in a room with. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  I give better odds to the Sultan of Science David Freberg. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=115.88s)]
*  He's just paranoid enough to survive with me in the bunker, even though he still won't [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  be questioning the Davos elites that got us here. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  How much did that intro cost? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  Does he come with a money back refund? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=129.95999999999998s)]
*  You guys are laughing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=134.92s)]
*  I'm laughing. I don't know. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=136.12s)]
*  I'm laughing. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=137.36s)]
*  Yeah, I thought it was with you or at you. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=137.88000000000002s)]
*  The funniest part was when you almost read aloud, it's like you were like, and then David [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=141.56s)]
*  Freberg, insert pause here. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  Just reading the notes. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=150.36s)]
*  It's an intro. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=151.36s)]
*  It's an intro. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=152.24s)]
*  I'm so glad we do an unscripted show. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=153.0s)]
*  OK, go ahead. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=154.8s)]
*  Freberg, I remember when you did the intro. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=156.4s)]
*  Come on. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=158.36s)]
*  Did I read? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=159.32000000000002s)]
*  Actually, didn't we cut it? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=159.84s)]
*  Yeah, you read and then you cut it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=160.88000000000002s)]
*  You hated it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  And then we made you put it back in or something like that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=163.24s)]
*  All I have to say to him about this job security is here. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=165.12s)]
*  OK, issue one, issue one, Google break up the Justice Department and eight states are [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  now seeking to break up Google's business, brokering digital advertising across the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  Internet. This is one of the most important legal challenges the companies ever faced. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  Follow the lawsuit on Tuesday. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=184.32s)]
*  The Justice Department did alleging that Google abuses its role as one of the largest [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=186.16s)]
*  broker, suppliers and online auctioneers of ads placed on websites and mobile [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=190.28s)]
*  applications. The filing promises a protracted court battle with huge implications [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=194.24s)]
*  for the digital advertising industry. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=199.0s)]
*  Of course, Google responded to the lawsuit in a blog post saying that the DOJ's [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=201.6s)]
*  request for it to unwind two previous acquisitions from a decade ago is an attempt to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=207.04s)]
*  rewrite history. They said the DOJ mischaracterizes how its advertising products work. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=210.96s)]
*  They say that people choose to use Google because they're effective. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=215.96s)]
*  And the company highlights other companies making moves in the advertising industry as [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=220.48s)]
*  well, such as Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and TikTok. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=224.92s)]
*  So I guess I'll kick it to you, Chamath. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=227.88s)]
*  Do you think the DOJ has a case here? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=230.36s)]
*  Do you believe that Google has a monopoly in online advertising and is unfairly using [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=232.76s)]
*  it to gain market share? And is this the right remedy? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=238.48s)]
*  Breaking up the company? Yeah, I think that this is a totally ill-founded lawsuit, and [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=241.36s)]
*  I think it just shows more of the personal enmity and anger that some people in the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=246.64s)]
*  U.S. government has towards entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship than anything else. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=254.27999999999997s)]
*  Now, why is that? Let's just think about what a monopoly is. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=258.44s)]
*  A monopoly or a monopolist effectively creates a completely stagnant, non-vibrant [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  market in which they have pricing power and complete control. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=269.44s)]
*  Now, the argument that I think that refutes that just on its face is if you actually look [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=273.2s)]
*  number one at their share and number two, how the rest of the share has changed over [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=278.59999999999997s)]
*  time. So, Nick, can you just please throw that up from Bloomberg? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=283.24s)]
*  This is just in a Bloomberg article that I just shared with you guys. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=285.64s)]
*  But Google controls 26.5 percent of a market. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  Forty three point four percent of that market is with a diverse group of others. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=293.08s)]
*  Meta has 18.4 percent and Amazon has 11.7 percent. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=298.4s)]
*  This is not the type of pie chart you would see if you had a monopolist. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=301.96000000000004s)]
*  So, for example, if you went back to the big, big, big monopolist case in the 1980s, which is [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  when we broke up Ma Bell. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=312.08s)]
*  Well, what that circle would have shown is that they basically had effectively 100 percent [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=314.04s)]
*  share. And what this shows is that there's a huge diversity of people in this market. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=319.08000000000004s)]
*  The second thing is that if you had done this chart many years ago, Amazon would have [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=323.92s)]
*  not really even been there. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=329.72s)]
*  And over the last five years, they represent almost 12 percent of the entire market. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  And it means that if you forecast it forward, they could be at 15 to 20 percent in a few [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  years as well. So while the pie is growing and definitely Google takes a lot of the profit [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=341.12s)]
*  dollars, the distribution is so much more than what anything looks like in a monopoly. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=346.36s)]
*  And so I just think it means that the DOJ is more focused on trying to punish these great [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=351.68s)]
*  American companies than it is in trying to be logical and reasoned. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=357.0s)]
*  And so I don't think this is going to work. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=361.16s)]
*  The last thing I'll say about this is that if you think about what you should have done, if I [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=363.28s)]
*  were the U.S. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=368.52s)]
*  government, I would have actually focused on search because search is a monopoly for [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=369.32s)]
*  Google. And while Google would try to argue that there are other ways of acquiring [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=375.16s)]
*  information, that is really not true. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=381.16s)]
*  And if you could prove that that monopoly then led to pricing power in ads, I think that's a [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=384.2s)]
*  much more nuanced but logical argument that could work. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=389.47999999999996s)]
*  But by focusing on this, I think it's going to get deconstructed. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=393.23999999999995s)]
*  It's going to fail. The Texas version of this exact lawsuit already was thrown out of [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=395.68s)]
*  federal court. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=400.2s)]
*  So I think that judges and the legal system don't have a lot of patience for this thing. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=401.47999999999996s)]
*  It just meant more to kind of scare American companies and try to play bogeyman and try to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=406.44s)]
*  decision maker. I don't think it's going to work. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=411.92s)]
*  Let me go to you. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=414.0s)]
*  I think Tramoth raises a really great point that if you define the market as digital [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=415.04s)]
*  advertising, Google's market share is only about a quarter. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=420.04s)]
*  That doesn't seem like a monopoly. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=422.88s)]
*  However, what the government says is that you shouldn't look at digital advertising as a [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=424.52000000000004s)]
*  whole, but rather the sort of brokered advertising that Google does for third party websites and [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=429.20000000000005s)]
*  applications. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=435.88s)]
*  Let me show a chart from their lawsuit. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=437.52s)]
*  You can see here that the way they define it, again, they see it as this brokering of [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=439.68s)]
*  sell side inventory, which are website publishers, and then buy side demand, which are [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=445.92s)]
*  advertisers. Defined this way, it looks like Google has 90 percent or more market share on [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=449.71999999999997s)]
*  the sell side because of the double click acquisition. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=457.28s)]
*  They've got somewhere between 40 and 80 percent market share. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=460.48s)]
*  On the demand side with advertisers and then in the middle, they have over 50 percent [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  market share of the ad exchange. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=468.88s)]
*  Is this the right way to look at Google's business or should we be just thinking about in [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=470.52s)]
*  terms of the overall digital advertising market? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=477.12s)]
*  I've been involved in ad networks since about 2002. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=480.96s)]
*  So it's been obviously I'm not directly involved in the business anymore, but I was [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=485.4s)]
*  pretty close to this and I was pretty close to double click in the acquisition. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=491.88s)]
*  I was a business product manager for a period of time on AdWords. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=497.12s)]
*  So the way that that chart kind of shows the connection between advertisers and publishers [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=501.0s)]
*  is correct that an ad network, generally speaking, brings buyers of ad inventory to the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=507.48s)]
*  sellers of ad inventory and the sellers of ad inventory have the option to sell their [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=514.6s)]
*  inventory on an ad network. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=519.76s)]
*  And if the money that they're making on those ad slots that they have, whether it's a [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=522.16s)]
*  slot on the side of a page or the top of a page or an interstitial video ad, whatever [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=526.28s)]
*  it is, they're going to keep selling their inventory through that network if they're [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=529.72s)]
*  getting paid the most. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=534.92s)]
*  And the real reason Google has won is two part. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=536.36s)]
*  One is because they ran their ad network as an auction, meaning advertisers were competing [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=538.76s)]
*  with each other to pay the most for an ad spot that was the highest quality. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=544.3199999999999s)]
*  There's also an ad quality index calculation, a click through index, a bounce back index. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=548.28s)]
*  So there's all this data that feeds into Google's ad network auction so that the ad [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=553.64s)]
*  that's shown on the publisher site is not just the best ad for the publisher, but the [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=559.16s)]
*  best ad for the consumer. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=563.04s)]
*  And then when the consumer clicks on the ad, the publisher gets paid. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=564.48s)]
*  And the second thing that Google did and so the auction dynamic is a really powerful [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=567.8s)]
*  dynamic. It creates the best price for the publisher and it creates the highest quality [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=571.64s)]
*  ad for the user, which translates typically into higher click throughs and better revenue. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=577.52s)]
*  What they also did that was really powerful is they did the highest revenue share in the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=583.88s)]
*  market. So historically, ad networks have like I think initially like a 60 40 red share [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=588.24s)]
*  where they only paid publishers 40 percent of the revenue the advertiser paid. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=593.48s)]
*  Then the network started to move to a 55 45 model, then a 50 50 model, then a 45 55 model. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=597.24s)]
*  I believe on average, Google currently is paying somewhere between 70 and 80 percent [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=603.0400000000001s)]
*  of their publishers. I got to check my math on that or whatever the latest. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=608.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=613.1600000000001s)]
*  But call it 70. And so it is a very competitive share. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=614.48s)]
*  Now, the point being, because it's an auction system and because it's opt in by the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=618.84s)]
*  publisher, if they're not paying the highest price, the publisher can go and get ads from [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=623.0400000000001s)]
*  somewhere else. And historically, publishers built their own sales force to sell ads and [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=627.1600000000001s)]
*  to source advertisers and to make money off of their ad inventory. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=631.92s)]
*  And it turns out it was a lot more effective to use an ad network to do that. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=635.36s)]
*  The other ad networks simply haven't been as good at building an auction model and building [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=639.64s)]
*  competitiveness. But I will tell you that when you get to a certain volume and it's not [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=643.52s)]
*  a big volume, you don't need a million advertisers bidding against each other. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=647.92s)]
*  You only need a few dozen advertisers. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=651.4399999999999s)]
*  And once you have a few dozen advertisers bidding against each other, you start to get [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=653.48s)]
*  very competitive in inventory. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=656.8s)]
*  So Google's real lock in with publishers and the real reason they win in this marketplace [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=658.32s)]
*  is because they pay the publishers the most. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=662.88s)]
*  And if you try and break this up and if you actually do try and get into the weeds of [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=665.84s)]
*  this whole system and change it, the publishers ultimately will make less money. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=671.0s)]
*  And this will be a real problem on the publisher side that they're making the most [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=675.2800000000001s)]
*  money. They're getting the highest share of advertisers spend and consumers are getting [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=680.48s)]
*  the best quality experience. That's what makes Google's model so hard to tackle from [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=683.9200000000001s)]
*  an antitrust perspective because it's giving. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=688.04s)]
*  So basically is what you're saying that because fundamentally this is an auction model, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=690.36s)]
*  it prevents Google from extracting monopoly rents. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=696.04s)]
*  Correct. And and they already pay the highest share on their ad network back to the [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=699.1999999999999s)]
*  publishers. And so you could go in and say, hey, high 60s or 70 percent, they should be [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=703.9599999999999s)]
*  paying 90 percent. What's the real right number if they're already paying more than [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=707.7199999999999s)]
*  anyone else to the publishers? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=711.4s)]
*  They're already making a lower margin than anyone. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=712.8399999999999s)]
*  And I'll say let me just let me just add two more things. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=715.28s)]
*  Sorry, which I think are just. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=717.28s)]
*  Well, can I go to Jake out first? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=718.36s)]
*  I was going to get Jake in here, even though he wouldn't do the same for me. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=719.4s)]
*  Jake, do you agree with Friedberg that that the reason for Google's success is that [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=723.12s)]
*  they're hyper efficient and this auction mechanism prevents monopoly behavior? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=727.44s)]
*  No, there is monopoly behavior going on at Google, obviously, with search and putting [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=732.84s)]
*  their own content and services up top. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=737.84s)]
*  And to Shemaz point, like that's probably the easier target. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=739.88s)]
*  Here, this just feels like they are maybe 10 years behind. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=743.64s)]
*  They should have just blocked the double click acquisition in 2008 and this [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=748.16s)]
*  consolidation of power. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=751.6s)]
*  The what publishers would say to Friedberg's point is. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=752.88s)]
*  When you're selling your own advertising, you get a much higher CPM when you go [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=758.36s)]
*  direct to Samsung or IBM or Disney. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=761.52s)]
*  And so you want to create those direct relationships. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=765.16s)]
*  How much do those direct relationships cost? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=766.96s)]
*  It's probably 20 or 30 percent, which is exactly to the percentage that Google is [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=769.04s)]
*  taking off the top. So Google is pretty aware of that. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=774.04s)]
*  But it's just paradoxical that they're doing this at this time, David, because [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=778.3199999999999s)]
*  Amazon has developed a huge ad business. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=782.68s)]
*  Netflix and Disney have now have ad tiers for their services to go up against [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=784.5999999999999s)]
*  YouTube. So and then for the first time, we've been talking about Google search [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=788.76s)]
*  supremacy being challenged by chat GPT. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=792.56s)]
*  So much like what happened with Microsoft, you know, they're just late, 10 years [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=795.5999999999999s)]
*  too late. Right, right. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=800.16s)]
*  So to use one of your favorite words is the DOJ acting as a rug puller here for [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=801.76s)]
*  Google in the sense that they're trying to unwind 10 year old acquisitions. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=807.0s)]
*  Is that does that make sense? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=810.12s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't make much sense. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=812.8399999999999s)]
*  Should the government be able to unwind acquisitions that happened a decade ago? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=814.0s)]
*  Does that make any sense? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=816.68s)]
*  No, no, they should. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=818.16s)]
*  They should learn from it and not do it again. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=820.56s)]
*  Yeah. What do you think? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=823.3199999999999s)]
*  I think it's a pretty bad way to approach things because they create so much [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=825.12s)]
*  uncertainty in the marketplace and has a chilling effect on future acquisitions. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=829.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Like when you get approval from the government, you want to know you're good. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=832.8s)]
*  Yeah. And we have an approval process. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=836.4399999999999s)]
*  So it seems to me, I agree with J. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=838.48s)]
*  Cowell, like if the government is going to have a problem with an acquisition, state [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=839.56s)]
*  it upfront. But then once they approve it, you're approved. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=843.7199999999999s)]
*  You're done. Otherwise, you know, companies will be much less likely to engage in [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=846.7199999999999s)]
*  acquisitions. And that's going to have a chilling effect on M&A behavior in the [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=850.68s)]
*  ecosystem, which is bad for the ecosystem as a whole. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=855.04s)]
*  Well, it really does. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=858.64s)]
*  It puts U.S. competitiveness against every other country and any other regulatory [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=860.92s)]
*  regime that'll be more permissive to this stuff. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=864.9599999999999s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=867.92s)]
*  And I think this is what's lost on this. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=869.76s)]
*  I just feel these lawsuits right now are bordering on the mean spirited because [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=871.64s)]
*  these things have been tried. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=876.4s)]
*  They've generally failed. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=878.1999999999999s)]
*  And so the real solution, it always goes back to this and it's ugly and messy is you [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=879.76s)]
*  need to rewrite the actual laws to reflect how business conditions exist today. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=885.16s)]
*  And so it's not the responsibility of the DOJ to try to fit a round peg into a square [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=891.4399999999999s)]
*  hole. It doesn't work like that. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=896.36s)]
*  And that's what they're trying to do. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=898.4399999999999s)]
*  They're trying to manipulate and contort the law to try to go after somebody that [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=899.56s)]
*  shouldn't frankly be gone after because these deals, to your point, were done a [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=905.7199999999999s)]
*  decade ago and they were done legally and they were done rightly. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=909.0799999999999s)]
*  So if you have an issue with how the market has evolved, change the law. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=912.7199999999999s)]
*  Right. I'll also add, I totally agree with Chamath. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=916.4799999999999s)]
*  I think that this action, you know, as one of our friends put it on our on our [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=920.0s)]
*  text screen, it's like killing the golden goose. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=925.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is one of the big job creators, innovators and taxpayers and employers [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=928.16s)]
*  and drivers of economic growth. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=932.4799999999999s)]
*  And why would we allow that to go and kind of burgeon offshore as a as a [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=934.24s)]
*  government? This is absolutely going to become kind of an opening for some [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=939.4399999999999s)]
*  international competitor to come in and try and provide alternative services with [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=946.68s)]
*  similar economics. I'll also say I just sent you guys a link. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=950.4399999999999s)]
*  I'll send you one more. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=953.68s)]
*  The market itself is becoming so much more challenging to operate in as an ad [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=955.04s)]
*  network. You know, e-commerce, so Amazon's ad business is booming, right. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=959.7199999999999s)]
*  As Chamath pointed out earlier, but so much more of consumer behavior is shifting [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=964.52s)]
*  where people are going direct to e-commerce sites and then the ads that are [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=969.28s)]
*  getting the highest click through and where advertisers are spending more and more [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=973.92s)]
*  money is on e-commerce sites. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=976.88s)]
*  I know this from experience on a couple of boards I'm at where companies stopped [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=978.8399999999999s)]
*  spending on Facebook and Google and just started spending exclusively on Amazon. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=982.3199999999999s)]
*  And that's where you get consumers that are much more likely to purchase the [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=986.1999999999999s)]
*  purchasing perclivity is higher. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=989.0s)]
*  The click through rate is higher. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=990.4s)]
*  So the return on ad spend is much higher. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=991.68s)]
*  And then I think that there's a big shift happening right now, as you guys know, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=994.08s)]
*  with third party cookies, Google has declared that they're removing third party [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=997.44s)]
*  cookies in 2024. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1000.28s)]
*  This means that in 2024, it is going to be very hard to track a user from one [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1001.76s)]
*  website to the next. If you go to a website and look at furniture and then you go [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1007.8s)]
*  to another website, third party cookies allow an advertiser to find you on that [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1010.68s)]
*  other website knowing that you were just looking at furniture and send you a [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1014.92s)]
*  furniture ad and say, hey, come on over and you're more likely to click on that [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1018.12s)]
*  ad. It's been very effective for advertising and particularly in the segment of [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1021.4s)]
*  advertising called retargeting. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1025.08s)]
*  But it is becoming much harder to do this with third party cookies and with the [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1026.96s)]
*  Apple identifier being yanked. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1030.44s)]
*  And Google just made an attempt to try and get this change with the W3C that was [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1031.84s)]
*  rejected. And that change is now going to make this hit very, very hard beginning [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1037.0s)]
*  in 2024. So the ad networks themselves are already being massively hurt by [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1040.84s)]
*  Apple's ID changes, the third party cookies being removed. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1044.92s)]
*  It's becoming harder to target consumers, harder to make money for publishers. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1048.76s)]
*  So meanwhile, the market's being challenged. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1053.3200000000002s)]
*  And this is the inverse definition of a monopoly. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1055.0800000000002s)]
*  When you have a market where there is dynamism, where companies are changing the [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1059.0s)]
*  rules and that is reallocating share gains to different players, that's the [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1062.92s)]
*  definition of a dynamic market that's self-regulating. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1069.0800000000002s)]
*  Totally. Five years ago, this would have made more sense. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1071.92s)]
*  Yeah, much more sense. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1074.16s)]
*  So I think this goes back down to one basic thing, which is do our elected and [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1075.44s)]
*  appointed officials really understand what's going on in the economy? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1081.1200000000001s)]
*  And I think this is an example that highlights not as much as they should. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1085.5600000000002s)]
*  And before a lawsuit like this gets filed, they should call us up. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1090.96s)]
*  If they called 30 of us into a room one by one and said, can you please explain [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1097.24s)]
*  how this works? You would have come to a different conclusion because we could [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1101.36s)]
*  have articulated these things and it would have been clear. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1105.8799999999999s)]
*  And so why do they not do that? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1108.8799999999999s)]
*  Or if they do do it, who's actually in there? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1110.84s)]
*  Either way, whatever's getting to the conclusion of let's go file this lawsuit [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1114.1999999999998s)]
*  in 2023 is late at a minimum and misguided at best. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1117.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, you have to ask the question, like, how is this different than Xi Jinping [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1122.8799999999999s)]
*  saying, you know what? Jack Ma is too powerful. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1128.04s)]
*  Therefore, he's going to learn to pay. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1130.3200000000002s)]
*  I think this is like our government saying Google. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1132.28s)]
*  It is totally different. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1135.2s)]
*  Totally different. Other than that, it's the same. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1136.04s)]
*  Well, I think that this lawsuit makes no sense. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1138.04s)]
*  You always have to bring it back to China. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1142.0800000000002s)]
*  Does everything in your brain have to virtue signal? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1143.6000000000001s)]
*  Like, it's like, no, I'm trying to be intellectually interesting conversation. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1146.0800000000002s)]
*  Jason Jason, we still manning an intellectually honest position. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1150.28s)]
*  Exactly. Let me finish. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1153.96s)]
*  Let me finish to Mark. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1155.44s)]
*  Let me finish before you jump the fence. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1156.68s)]
*  Very simply, you asked, like, why are they filing something that makes no sense? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1160.48s)]
*  My decision is I think they want to have an outcome. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1164.8000000000002s)]
*  And their outcome is they want to stick it to big tech because it's too powerful. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1168.16s)]
*  And then you just said yourself, square peg round hole. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1171.1200000000001s)]
*  They're trying to find something to get Google on. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1174.3200000000002s)]
*  This is not it. How does it relate to China? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1176.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, I agree with J. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1179.72s)]
*  Cal here, actually. I'll defend for a second. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1181.5600000000002s)]
*  I just second world second race moderator. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1183.2s)]
*  Yeah. Third greatest take China out of it for a second, because that could mean [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1186.0s)]
*  a lot of different things. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1189.8400000000001s)]
*  And so I don't want to get hung up on that. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1190.88s)]
*  But it does feel to me like the government is lashing out [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1193.0s)]
*  against companies like Google because they're perceived as being too powerful. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1197.1200000000001s)]
*  That's what's going on. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1200.96s)]
*  And in fact, I mean, that's Lena Conn's theory is that we have to stop [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1202.3600000000001s)]
*  big tech companies from getting bigger because power. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1205.8400000000001s)]
*  But in this case, it doesn't make any sense because the auction market [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1209.0800000000002s)]
*  for advertising is very competitive and the remedy of unwinding [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1213.6000000000001s)]
*  10 year old deals doesn't make any sense. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1217.16s)]
*  So they're just kind of barking up the wrong tree is sort of the David. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1218.84s)]
*  There's there's two other things that they really should be looking at [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1223.08s)]
*  as these ad networks are losing their market share in the overall digital [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1226.04s)]
*  ad spend. There are two other players, Disney, you know, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1230.32s)]
*  and Netflix doing these digital ads on their platforms and having ad tiers. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1234.4399999999998s)]
*  And then you may have noticed Uber is doing an ad business now. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1239.52s)]
*  They did three hundred fifty million dollars in the first year [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1242.4399999999998s)]
*  of that business, a million a day. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1244.8s)]
*  And they're projected to do a billion next year. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1246.36s)]
*  And those have location information in it because you have your destination. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1248.8s)]
*  And so those networks and new opportunities are emerging. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1252.7199999999998s)]
*  It's a dynamic space. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1256.76s)]
*  I just want to say, like, you guys are making, like, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1258.0s)]
*  I think a really important macro point, which is like in a marketplace. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1260.56s)]
*  It's always easy to hate the winners [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1264.76s)]
*  and claim that their success is unfair if you're not part of it. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1268.1599999999999s)]
*  And I think that just because something successful in a marketplace [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1272.28s)]
*  doesn't mean it's a monopoly. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1275.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, this whole thing of envy, you know, we've. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1278.08s)]
*  We've heard from like the Berkshire shareholders meeting, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1281.9199999999998s)]
*  I think there was a good conversation around this, but envy really [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1284.48s)]
*  is ultimately the doom of innovation and democracy. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1287.96s)]
*  It's like you see the success, you want to take down the successful. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1290.72s)]
*  Nothing can be too successful or else it has to be destroyed. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1294.3999999999999s)]
*  And then, you know, as we talked about, it's going to go somewhere else. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1297.6799999999998s)]
*  Well, I mean, just play devil's advocate with it on that free bird. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1300.6799999999998s)]
*  It sounds like we all agree that the government has kind of the wrong theory [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1303.48s)]
*  and is barking up the wrong tree here. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1306.32s)]
*  However, isn't it the case that Apple and Google are too powerful? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1307.6s)]
*  Maybe not in this auction advertising auction marketplace, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1312.7199999999998s)]
*  but when it comes to the app store, I mean, they have an operating system [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1316.6799999999998s)]
*  monopoly with iOS and Android or doopoly. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1320.32s)]
*  But I think you're you're bringing up the key point, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1323.0s)]
*  which is these nuances are the ones that matter. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1325.24s)]
*  There is a body of law today, David, that you can apply pretty intelligently [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1327.52s)]
*  and thoughtfully to that exact problem and also to Google search. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1332.52s)]
*  And so it's a bit of a headscratcher why the DOJ hasn't spent the time to figure out [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1337.28s)]
*  to even understand that that's actually where they should be focused, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1342.1999999999998s)]
*  because that is where there is truly. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1344.9599999999998s)]
*  In the app store case, we have it. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1348.08s)]
*  It's a duopoly. So it's very clear. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1350.0s)]
*  The share shift has already been set. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1352.52s)]
*  There is no share shift happening to a third player. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1354.4399999999998s)]
*  There is no side loading that's really happening. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1356.8799999999999s)]
*  And so domestically in the United States and Western Europe, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1358.9199999999998s)]
*  there's a de facto duopoly, complete control, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1362.1599999999999s)]
*  completely inflexible inelastic pricing. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1365.1200000000001s)]
*  That is a monopoly. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1369.04s)]
*  And then separately for search in the United States, it is also an effective monopoly. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1370.8s)]
*  And those are the things where if you really wanted to go after them [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1375.4s)]
*  because you think there's some damage being done to people, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1378.44s)]
*  I would have focused there. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1381.3600000000001s)]
*  But the ad business has nothing to do with any of this and just means that [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1382.32s)]
*  they don't understand how the market works. Right. OK. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1386.96s)]
*  So shifting gears, Microsoft has just been sued on antitrust grounds, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1389.6000000000001s)]
*  or rather, there's a probe by the EU. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1393.96s)]
*  And this was based on a complaint actually from Slack. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1396.8s)]
*  Slack filed a complaint back in 2020 [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1400.8s)]
*  that Microsoft was basically engaging in in bundling or tying of products. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1404.32s)]
*  The allegation is that Microsoft unfairly ties Microsoft Teams [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1410.0s)]
*  and other software to its widely used office suite. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1413.6000000000001s)]
*  Do you guys think that's a better claim? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1417.52s)]
*  OK, so I mean, I'll just say, like, you know, there was an episode that we did, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1419.6000000000001s)]
*  I think, back in September, where I basically railed against Microsoft [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1423.32s)]
*  for exactly this kind of bundling. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1427.28s)]
*  It seems like the EU has picked up that theory and wants to go after bundling. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1429.04s)]
*  We did Slack series, I was on the board, took it public, blah, blah, blah. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1434.52s)]
*  I'll tell you the thing that we talked about a lot. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1438.6s)]
*  That was the thing that I was always like the most afraid of, which is. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1441.76s)]
*  How can we compete with a better product in the face of superior distribution? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1447.52s)]
*  I think what Microsoft did was anti-competitive, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1452.96s)]
*  but I don't think it was monopolistic. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1457.6000000000001s)]
*  And I think that the EU in that time [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1460.1200000000001s)]
*  has a much better framework of laws that they had demonstrated up until now. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1463.8s)]
*  They were willing to enforce around anti-competitive pricing. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1467.72s)]
*  And so part of what Slack was trying to do was create some airspace [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1472.16s)]
*  for that to get into the ether, to the discussion that it's like, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1477.8s)]
*  we could build the best product in the world. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1481.56s)]
*  But if Microsoft gives it away with this other product that is quasi-essential, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1483.72s)]
*  they'll always beat us. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1488.8s)]
*  And there's nothing we can do about it. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1490.3999999999999s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1492.16s)]
*  And I think that was basically the question that was posed to the European [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1493.28s)]
*  authorities because we thought that they would pay attention to it. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1496.24s)]
*  What's interesting about it is that then, you know, when the acquisition happened [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1498.48s)]
*  to Salesforce, it sort of waters down that claim because now Salesforce [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1502.6s)]
*  also has a set of really essential products that are useful [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1507.0s)]
*  and needed in the market that Slack can go and attach themselves to. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1510.4s)]
*  And in many ways, David, it forced the hand of Slack to be acquired by Salesforce. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1515.0400000000002s)]
*  And if not Salesforce, it would have to have been somebody else. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1520.5600000000002s)]
*  But could it have been an independent company had we not had to compete [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1523.68s)]
*  against teams in that way, meaning if we had to compete against another [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1528.3200000000002s)]
*  well-funded startup, would it still be public? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1531.4s)]
*  I suspect so. I don't think we would have sold to Salesforce. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1534.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, that's exactly was my point. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1537.3200000000002s)]
*  When we talked about this last time is that if Microsoft can basically clone [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1539.76s)]
*  the sort of the breakthrough innovative product, you know, just say they do one [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1546.12s)]
*  every year and then they put a crappy version of that in their bundle. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1550.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, 10 percent or 50 percent worse. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1555.2s)]
*  But they give it away effectively for free as part of the bundle. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1557.36s)]
*  And then they basically pull the legs out from under that other company. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1560.72s)]
*  So it can't be a vibrant competitor. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1563.4s)]
*  And then the next year, they'll just raise the price of the bundle. Right. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1565.68s)]
*  And they've done that with Slack. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1568.3999999999999s)]
*  They've done that with Okta. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1569.84s)]
*  They've done that with Zoom. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1571.4799999999998s)]
*  You know, Jake, can we have a vibrant tech ecosystem, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1573.52s)]
*  at least in B2B software, if Microsoft can just keep doing that indefinitely? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1577.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's a difficult question. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1582.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't know, though, if what the consumer harm is here, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1584.4399999999998s)]
*  if you keep adding great features to a bundle. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1587.6399999999999s)]
*  So to take the other side of the argument, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1590.3999999999999s)]
*  you know, Zoom has now added channels like Slack. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1592.28s)]
*  Slack has added huddles, which are essentially Zoom calls. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1594.84s)]
*  And now they're both going to try to add the coda and notion [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1598.92s)]
*  wiki wiki style, you know, documents to both Zoom and Slack. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1603.56s)]
*  So everybody's copying everybody's features. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1607.96s)]
*  Everybody's incorporating everybody's features. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1609.48s)]
*  It takes a little bit of time. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1611.36s)]
*  This is actually a lot better behavior [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1613.32s)]
*  for Microsoft than the old days when they would do something called vaporware. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1616.2s)]
*  They used to announce products to chill people from buying them. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1619.56s)]
*  So they would announce a Slack two years before Slack came out [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1622.76s)]
*  just to get people to not install Slack. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1625.64s)]
*  They did that with Lotus Notes. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1627.72s)]
*  They said that a Lotus Notes competitor coming for two years [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1628.68s)]
*  and it never materialized. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1631.44s)]
*  So I think the marketplace will compete. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1632.56s)]
*  And if you look at Slack itself, it's still growing. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1635.96s)]
*  The same percentage growth it did. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1639.64s)]
*  Inside of Salesforce that it did as an independent company, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1642.56s)]
*  so it's growing at a similar pace. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1645.44s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1646.36s)]
*  Great. Nick, can you pull up this chart? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1647.2s)]
*  Yeah, it was like high teens or something. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1648.96s)]
*  Was there was there? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1650.68s)]
*  I mean, it looks like from this chart that Slack has kind of leveled off. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1651.6399999999999s)]
*  That's the number of users. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1655.1599999999999s)]
*  I was talking about revenue. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1656.08s)]
*  If you look at Slack's revenue quarter over quarter, it's basically been the same. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1657.1599999999999s)]
*  Wasn't there a report that it's been a little bit of a disappointment to Salesforce? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1661.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, this number here that we're looking at, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1665.04s)]
*  where it's just 75 million Microsoft Teams members, 12 million Slack members. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1668.56s)]
*  By the way, if you wanted to if you wanted to play conspiracy theories, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1673.32s)]
*  maybe that's why there was a falling out between Benny off and Brett. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1676.48s)]
*  I mean, Brett was the champion of this deal, you know, 28 billion dollar acquisition [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1680.3999999999999s)]
*  and 28 billion dollars, it's threading a needle. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1685.6s)]
*  The only one of that scale that's really worked out definitively has been LinkedIn. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1688.3999999999999s)]
*  So if Slack hiccuped in a moment when we also had a regime change in rates and valuations. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1692.32s)]
*  Now look at Benny off is looking down the barrel of a activist investor [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1699.12s)]
*  program from Elliott, and I mean, yeah, maybe it's not doing as well as they needed it to. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1703.36s)]
*  I got the sense that Benny off was genuinely sorry that Brett [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1708.76s)]
*  decided to leave and that it was voluntary, voluntary on Brett's part [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1712.3200000000002s)]
*  and regretted basically, as opposed to, you know, a non regretted termination. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1715.5600000000002s)]
*  I have no idea. Like I said, I was I was pre qualifying with saying, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1720.96s)]
*  let's play conspiracy theory for a second. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1723.92s)]
*  Fair enough. OK. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1725.6000000000001s)]
*  But can I have a suggestion? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1726.76s)]
*  Yeah, a suggestion. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1728.24s)]
*  Here's a suggestion for the regulators that are listening or watching our podcast. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1729.5200000000002s)]
*  A really valuable thing for the industry that you could do [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1735.24s)]
*  would be to introduce transparency on ELAs. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1738.88s)]
*  What are those enterprise licensing agreements? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1742.0s)]
*  These are these things that these big companies use to throw everything [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1744.64s)]
*  in the kitchen sink into a deal when they sell to a company. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1748.68s)]
*  But if there was transparency [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1752.1200000000001s)]
*  and there was a sense of how those things were priced, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1754.5200000000002s)]
*  so think of it like the FDA saying here's you have to publish your ingredients, right? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1756.8000000000002s)]
*  And what percentage of it is this and that? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1760.8400000000001s)]
*  It would be really beneficial because it would slow down [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1763.3600000000001s)]
*  the tendency of these big companies to try to kill the small companies [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1766.9199999999998s)]
*  with these poorer products. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1771.0s)]
*  And something around ELAs and more transparency around pricing to the market [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1772.84s)]
*  could be a good governor without having to go down the path [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1776.3999999999999s)]
*  of all this antitrust legislation after the fact. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1779.04s)]
*  I think there is some good advice for regulators there. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1781.56s)]
*  I think they should focus on anti competitive tactics [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1783.52s)]
*  and like clarifying what those are, as opposed to some of these crazy [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1786.72s)]
*  lawsuits to break up companies that don't seem to have well grounded theories. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1791.56s)]
*  It'd be, I think, better to focus on the specific tactics that create the harm [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1796.24s)]
*  and identifying what those are. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1799.96s)]
*  Jake, out of your point about how what Microsoft is doing [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1801.6000000000001s)]
*  doesn't seem to be harming anybody, it seems to be benefiting consumers. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1804.8400000000001s)]
*  I think that's a valid point, but I would bring up a different example, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1808.16s)]
*  which is if you look at the anti competitive behavior of dumping. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1812.92s)]
*  Where a company will basically dump its product on the market for free, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1818.1200000000001s)]
*  destroy all the other competitors, and once they're out, they can raise prices [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1821.8000000000002s)]
*  because the barriers to entry are high. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1825.4s)]
*  There's a huge cost of like basically entering the industry. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1827.2s)]
*  I think that this bundling behavior is a form of dumping [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1830.92s)]
*  where in the short run, it looks like consumers are benefiting [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1834.3200000000002s)]
*  because they're getting Zoom, a Zoom clone for free or a Slack clone for free. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1837.5600000000002s)]
*  But then what happens is once they've hobbled those companies, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1842.48s)]
*  they raise the price of the bundle. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1846.2s)]
*  So I think if we want to have a healthy long term ecosystem, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1847.88s)]
*  I think this type of like bundling behavior is great. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1850.68s)]
*  Bad. I think it's anti competitive. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1853.44s)]
*  It's a great point. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1855.28s)]
*  But I think there's a very specific solution for it. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1856.04s)]
*  You don't need to break up Microsoft. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1858.08s)]
*  What you need to do is require that when they create a bundle, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1859.68s)]
*  every product in that bundle needs to basically have an individual price. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1863.24s)]
*  Exactly. And the price of every product in that bundle should add up [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1867.2s)]
*  to the cost of the bundle. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1869.92s)]
*  So they can't do, like you said, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1871.36s)]
*  come out these like transfer payments or subsidies to basically, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1872.84s)]
*  you know, take over, systematically take over every set vertical. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1877.0s)]
*  I think that would be amazing. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1880.56s)]
*  By the way, there are many other markets, David, where that exactly exists, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1881.6s)]
*  where if you have the ability to [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1884.4s)]
*  preferentially put your product into your distribution channel, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1888.2s)]
*  you have to transfer price it transparently at the market. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1892.48s)]
*  And it's what everybody else would be able to get it at. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1897.52s)]
*  And that then allows the best product to win in the market. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1900.16s)]
*  And it gives the government the ability to say, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1904.88s)]
*  I understand that these rails are roughly monopolistic, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1907.68s)]
*  but I'm going to leave them alone. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1910.44s)]
*  As long as you treat everything that sits on top of those rails equally. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1912.2s)]
*  And that nuance is missing in software. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1916.6000000000001s)]
*  So I think the combination of transparency in these enterprise [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1918.52s)]
*  licensing agreements and more transparency and accounting treatment [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1921.4s)]
*  for what you just said would solve a lot of this problem. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1925.24s)]
*  And you would have a more vibrant ecosystem where the big guys [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1928.76s)]
*  can't just snuff out the small guys whenever they want. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1932.0s)]
*  Yeah, I disagree with you guys. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1934.64s)]
*  Let me just let me just play. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1936.24s)]
*  Let me just play my devil's advocate, which is kind of how I feel as well. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1937.4s)]
*  I think these concepts of monopolistic bundling made a lot of sense. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1943.1200000000001s)]
*  I make a lot of sense in the sense [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1948.44s)]
*  in if what you're bundling and the service or the product or whatever [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1950.0400000000002s)]
*  is a commodity product. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1953.64s)]
*  And these statements that you're making assume that one messaging service [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1955.1200000000001s)]
*  is the same as another messaging service, that one video app [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1959.44s)]
*  is the same as another video app. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1962.52s)]
*  And that by giving a discount, they're going to win the market. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1964.76s)]
*  The reality that may have made sense back in the day [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1968.5600000000002s)]
*  when there were things like trains and trains had a monopoly [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1970.96s)]
*  on where things could go or electricity or oil production [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1973.56s)]
*  and all of the kind of origins of kind of monopolistic antitrust. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1976.64s)]
*  Laws and actions started to kind of emerge here in our free market in the US. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1982.6000000000001s)]
*  But when it comes to software, if your product is the same [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1986.96s)]
*  as the other guy's product, maybe they deserve to win by bundling. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1990.48s)]
*  And maybe it's OK for them to offer a discount and beat you on pricing, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1994.56s)]
*  because if your product is actually better and it provides better [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=1998.2s)]
*  ROI for the customer and has a better feature set, it's faster. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2001.4s)]
*  It has a bunch of stuff that the other product doesn't have. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2004.92s)]
*  The market will pick it. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2007.3200000000002s)]
*  It's not that the market's going to say, hey, we're just a bunch of idiots. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2008.8000000000002s)]
*  These products are so differentiated. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2011.96s)]
*  But because these guys are giving me a discount, I'm going to go over [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2013.48s)]
*  the discount. That's not how it works. And you guys know this. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2015.68s)]
*  I'm not saying that Microsoft can't copy Slack and then under charge [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2018.44s)]
*  a different price and charge a different price and a lower price and discount. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2022.24s)]
*  What I'm saying is they can't cross subsidize their Slack competitor. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2025.68s)]
*  It's the fact that they can copy Slack that makes Slack. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2029.76s)]
*  That means that Slack should lose the fact that that's Slack. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2034.2800000000002s)]
*  No, I disagree. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2037.5200000000002s)]
*  Almost all software is look, software. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2038.3200000000002s)]
*  New software is really hard to create, but really easy to copy. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2041.16s)]
*  I mean, the first version of a new product is hard to create, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2045.16s)]
*  but you can reverse engineer almost any software product. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2048.6800000000003s)]
*  Show me where someone's made a better competitor to Google search. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2051.8s)]
*  Show me where consumers don't choose to go to another search engine [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2054.96s)]
*  because Google's built a better search engine. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2057.64s)]
*  No, it's because there's a data network effect there that the more [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2059.2000000000003s)]
*  searches they provide, the more data they get. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2061.48s)]
*  It's the reinforcement learning. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2063.8s)]
*  I'll say I'll say it differently. It's easier to copy. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2065.08s)]
*  There's an asymptote to that quality point, though. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2067.6s)]
*  I don't think that that's necessarily true. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2069.52s)]
*  I think there's a nuance here that. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2071.08s)]
*  And by the way, all the social networks that people thought [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2072.64s)]
*  were had massive lock in effect turns out they don't. Right. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2074.64s)]
*  David, no, that's not true. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2076.84s)]
*  Look, there's more lock in deeper in the stack that you exist. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2078.1600000000003s)]
*  There's very little lock in at the application layer. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2082.28s)]
*  So workflow apps, which effectively is what most of these [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2084.68s)]
*  enterprise software things are, are very copyable [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2088.56s)]
*  because there's nothing that really locks it in. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2092.44s)]
*  But if you're a social network or if you're some deep machine [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2095.04s)]
*  learned thing that basically generates great search results, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2098.0s)]
*  that's much harder to copy because more and more of the product [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2101.08s)]
*  and generates the product quality is underneath the waterline. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2104.36s)]
*  But I think in enterprise software, it's all thin [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2107.6800000000003s)]
*  UI layers on top of very simple. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2111.2400000000002s)]
*  Don't compete. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2113.28s)]
*  Then don't compete because the bigger guy that offers a discount [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2114.0s)]
*  is always going to beat you. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2116.28s)]
*  What he's saying, which I agree with, is you just if you could add [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2117.1600000000003s)]
*  transparency so that you understand what is happening. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2120.44s)]
*  I don't think anybody's against transparency. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2124.08s)]
*  Nobody should be against it. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2125.6800000000003s)]
*  And if if Microsoft wants to charge a penny a seat for teams, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2127.2400000000002s)]
*  then they should be allowed to do that. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2132.56s)]
*  I don't think we're saying that they shouldn't. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2133.96s)]
*  A lot of startups have used the opposite tactic where they've entered [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2135.48s)]
*  with free offerings or free services and then they try and upsell later. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2138.12s)]
*  And we don't complain about that. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2141.64s)]
*  There's a lot of ways to compete in the marketplace. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2143.2400000000002s)]
*  There's no bundling. There's no bundling. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2144.84s)]
*  There's no dumping. But that's my point. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2146.7200000000003s)]
*  There's a lot of ways to compete in the marketplace. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2148.48s)]
*  If the product you're offering is of parity, the problem is that [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2150.12s)]
*  that no, build something that's different enough [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2153.92s)]
*  that people are willing to pay for it. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2156.32s)]
*  Well, then, you know, they're willing to pay more than they'll pay [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2157.84s)]
*  the big guy that's giving them a bundling discount. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2160.7200000000003s)]
*  Just build a better product. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2162.52s)]
*  Then the whole B2B SaaS space should basically pack up shop and go home. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2163.8s)]
*  We should just stop funding. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2167.52s)]
*  VC should stop funding new SaaS companies because [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2169.0s)]
*  and all those productivity gains will just go up the window. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2172.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Why would you fund any? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2174.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's a definition of anti-competitive. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2176.36s)]
*  Then, you know, how's that bad for the customer? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2178.2400000000002s)]
*  They're paying less and they're getting a better. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2180.28s)]
*  But if you are new products created. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2181.84s)]
*  Yeah. Freeburg at the limit. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2183.52s)]
*  What you're basically saying is because Comcast is a monopolistic provider [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2184.6400000000003s)]
*  of my Internet connection, I should have to take their video offering [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2188.5600000000004s)]
*  and will never use Netflix. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2192.0800000000004s)]
*  No, it's a they have they offer a commodity. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2194.04s)]
*  That's my point. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2196.4s)]
*  If you're offering a commodity, these things should apply. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2197.44s)]
*  Makes a ton of sense. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2199.5600000000004s)]
*  But what you're saying, but what you're saying effectively [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2200.7200000000003s)]
*  and what you just said is that B2B software is effectively a commodity. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2202.76s)]
*  Anyone can copy it. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2205.8s)]
*  Anyone can replicate it. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2206.88s)]
*  Comcast said to you, I'm turning this off. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2207.88s)]
*  You only have one choice and it's mine because these is my rails and I built it. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2210.0s)]
*  You would turn to the government to help you because you would say, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2214.44s)]
*  but Netflix is a better product. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2217.32s)]
*  And what David is saying is the exact same argument. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2219.7200000000003s)]
*  So my point is, unless you also believe logically that you're allowed to turn off [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2222.76s)]
*  Netflix if you're Comcast and take their crappy VOD service, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2226.36s)]
*  then you're you're at least intellectually consistent. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2230.52s)]
*  Well, if you don't believe that. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2233.8s)]
*  Steel is a commodity, too, and you can't engage in dumping. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2235.52s)]
*  I mean, this is the argument is that, for example, you know, with respect to China, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2239.12s)]
*  the argument was that they were dumping cheap steel in the US market [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2243.08s)]
*  to drive all the US producers out of business. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2246.88s)]
*  And then once they were out of business, they'd raise the price. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2248.92s)]
*  The point is, there's all these examples where we have had the intelligence [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2250.84s)]
*  and the ability to be nuanced about this, to see that these things are possible [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2254.44s)]
*  and they shouldn't exist. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2257.96s)]
*  We don't let Comcast turn off Netflix. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2259.1600000000003s)]
*  OK, we have a law around that. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2262.04s)]
*  I understand. So I think what we're saying is [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2264.32s)]
*  embrace and extend this law for these new markets that didn't exist [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2267.08s)]
*  50 and 100 years ago when these laws were written, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2271.0s)]
*  so that the same benefits that we have in the steel market [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2273.8s)]
*  and in the cable market we have in the software market, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2276.96s)]
*  it'll just create a healthier ecosystem. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2280.24s)]
*  J. Cal, you want to get in on this? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2282.04s)]
*  Yeah, I just think I was just saying, I wonder when you install teams, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2283.08s)]
*  does it automatically when you install the Microsoft Office Suite, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2286.9599999999996s)]
*  does it automatically install teams? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2290.3199999999997s)]
*  Because it does seem the default there matters. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2292.3999999999996s)]
*  Do people have to actively turn it on or is it actively built in? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2294.4399999999996s)]
*  And so the bundling of it, I think, matters and that interoperability matters. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2297.64s)]
*  So there are other vectors here to force them into interoperability. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2301.68s)]
*  So if you open your Windows machine, do you have a choice of? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2306.3199999999997s)]
*  It depends, for example, let's just say that you use [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2309.84s)]
*  exchange for certain things, but in other things, for example, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2315.1200000000003s)]
*  to manage your namespace, you may use Okta, but then they say, actually, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2318.36s)]
*  no, we need you to use our version of Okta. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2321.84s)]
*  It all becomes complicated. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2325.44s)]
*  I think it's too complicated for a government to understand. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2326.88s)]
*  So I think the general thing is, can we extend the definition [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2329.36s)]
*  of these basic rules that we've agreed to in other markets [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2334.1200000000003s)]
*  to include technology? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2337.56s)]
*  And would we be better served? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2339.12s)]
*  And I think for the most part, I do think it would be. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2341.12s)]
*  It would better serve startups. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2343.64s)]
*  It would better serve the folks that want to build. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2345.52s)]
*  How would that work in practicality, though? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2347.96s)]
*  You would you would have office, they say, here's not what they've turned it on [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2349.52s)]
*  for a dollar a person or something. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2353.96s)]
*  Here's introductory price. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2355.44s)]
*  I think the combination of what David said and I said would do the trick, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2356.7999999999997s)]
*  which is if you force these highly complicated license agreements [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2359.68s)]
*  to be transparent, it would not allow them to dump. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2363.64s)]
*  And then the second thing is that all of that transfer pricing [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2367.96s)]
*  that goes into that license cost needs to sum up to the cost itself. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2371.44s)]
*  Now, why is that important? [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2375.3599999999997s)]
*  You can learn about how they prevent this in health care. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2376.7999999999997s)]
*  So let's take Pfizer. Good example. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2380.8799999999997s)]
*  Here's a company with 30 billion dollars on the balance sheet. Right. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2382.52s)]
*  And Pfizer has a need still [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2386.6s)]
*  to subsidize all of the R&D of their drugs. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2390.24s)]
*  And you would say, well, yeah, they have 30 billion dollars. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2392.44s)]
*  So they should just take the money off the balance sheet and do it. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2394.48s)]
*  Why don't they do it? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2396.6s)]
*  It's because the accounting laws and all of the complicated, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2397.84s)]
*  anti-competitive laws say, well, if you want to take this cash pile [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2400.32s)]
*  and use it over here, it goes from an asset liability item, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2403.2000000000003s)]
*  30 billion of cash, and all of a sudden I'm going to net it against your EPS. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2408.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2412.76s)]
*  That's I think there's an actual cost for these companies to do this stuff, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2413.44s)]
*  to bundle, to cross to all of this stuff. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2418.7200000000003s)]
*  And so what do they do? They go into the market. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2420.52s)]
*  They ask startups to build stuff and then they buy it. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2422.8s)]
*  That's the kind of market I think is better for us. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2425.08s)]
*  Let's have that be the last word on this topic, as we've been going for a while. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2427.36s)]
*  But I'm glad you brought up Pfizer, because this brings us to issue two. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2429.96s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2434.12s)]
*  Which is and I think we can show this clip. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2435.52s)]
*  Red meat for David. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2437.64s)]
*  Yeah. So Albert Burlow, who's the CEO of Pfizer, went to Davos last week [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2438.48s)]
*  and he probably expect to Davos, you know, the the conference, the surplus elites. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2443.0s)]
*  And he expected probably nothing but softballs and fawning treatment [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2448.52s)]
*  from the establishment media. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2452.52s)]
*  And instead, he probably had the most uncomfortable walk of his life [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2453.72s)]
*  when two reporters from rebel news approached him outside the room [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2457.04s)]
*  and started asking him some tough questions. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2461.0s)]
*  Let's roll tape. What's rebel news? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2463.68s)]
*  Or like, can I ask you, when did you know that the vaccines didn't stop transmission? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2466.2s)]
*  How long did you know that without saying it publicly? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2471.8s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2474.68s)]
*  I'm sorry. Question. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2475.96s)]
*  I mean, we now know that the vaccines didn't stop transmission. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2477.8s)]
*  But why did you keep it secret? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2481.8s)]
*  Good question. You said it was 100 percent effective, then 90 percent, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2484.96s)]
*  then 80 percent, then 70 percent. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2488.52s)]
*  But we now know that the vaccines do not trans stop transmission. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2490.96s)]
*  Why did you keep that secret? [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2494.36s)]
*  Have a nice day. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2496.32s)]
*  I won't have a nice day until I know the answer. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2497.6s)]
*  Why did you keep it a secret that your vaccine did not stop transmission? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2500.48s)]
*  We should we should cut this. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2506.04s)]
*  OK, we can stop from there. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2507.44s)]
*  But that. Wow. Welcome to Info Wars. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2508.44s)]
*  All in it for us. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2510.68s)]
*  That's what real journalism looks like. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2511.64s)]
*  First of all, you know, real journalism looks like. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2513.04s)]
*  Not a bunch of New York Times reporters covering for powerful people, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2515.84s)]
*  but asking them tough questions. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2518.56s)]
*  OK, is that a legitimate question, Freiburg? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2520.52s)]
*  Is that a legitimate question? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2522.72s)]
*  Freiburg, what do you think of the question? Is it legit or not? [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2524.36s)]
*  You got you guys are about to get us down ranked on YouTube and Spotify. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2526.4s)]
*  We're about to get warning labels covering for this sort of thing. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2530.88s)]
*  Yeah, I love your way. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2534.64s)]
*  You're right that YouTube banned that video. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2536.04s)]
*  We had to watch it on Twitter because Elon Musk Twitter is still free. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2539.24s)]
*  OK, listen, why is YouTube protecting? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2542.96s)]
*  Why? Hold on. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2544.84s)]
*  Why is YouTube abridging freedom of the press [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2545.68s)]
*  in order to protect the powerful CEO of Pfizer for answering more questions? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2549.36s)]
*  That is a question. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2553.68s)]
*  Yeah, just their basic questions. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2554.92s)]
*  Isn't it legitimate question of did they cover up [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2557.68s)]
*  the fact that the vaccines didn't transmit? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2561.76s)]
*  I think it's like a legitimate question that I would actually want to know the answer to. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2564.44s)]
*  I don't know why you didn't just answer that. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2567.84s)]
*  No, we didn't cover it up. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2569.44s)]
*  Freiburg, what are you? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2572.48s)]
*  You're asking me if I know what whether Pfizer did a cover up. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2574.0s)]
*  Is that what you're like? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2576.96s)]
*  Well, no, it's a legitimate question is what I'm getting at. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2578.52s)]
*  Why are you unwilling to question the Pfizer CEO? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2580.76s)]
*  Oh, no, I'm not. I'm not. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2583.8s)]
*  I'm not unwilling to question at all, but I'm not. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2584.8s)]
*  I don't think that this is a fight. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2586.6400000000003s)]
*  Look, first of all, Pfizer is a commercial enterprise, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2588.08s)]
*  so they have the incentive to make money. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2592.48s)]
*  100 percent. Right. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2594.4s)]
*  So their objective is to sell a vaccine. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2595.44s)]
*  I think they're making 10 to 15 billion dollars on this vaccine this year. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2597.2s)]
*  You're absolutely right that the economic incentive is there for Pfizer [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2602.16s)]
*  to continue to push and rationalize the sales of this vaccine. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2606.48s)]
*  The efficacy of the vaccine waned very quickly. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2610.64s)]
*  As this virus evolved and mutated, it became pretty evident pretty fast [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2613.8s)]
*  that the the rate of. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2617.56s)]
*  Transmission in vaccinated people continue to go up. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2621.96s)]
*  And, you know, this may be a function of the quality of the vaccine [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2626.32s)]
*  or the efficacy of the vaccine, more likely a function of the fact that [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2629.7599999999998s)]
*  the virus as predicted evolved and therefore the antibodies [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2633.68s)]
*  that are produced and the T cell response that's induced by the original vaccine [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2637.7599999999998s)]
*  becomes less efficacious over time. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2643.0s)]
*  So the real question is a policy question, a behavioral question. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2645.08s)]
*  But look, Pfizer didn't have another product to sell. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2647.92s)]
*  So it certainly makes sense for them to continue to sell their product. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2650.12s)]
*  And there is still good data that represents that there is some immune [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2653.0s)]
*  response and some benefit in certain populations to continuing to get [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2657.3199999999997s)]
*  a booster and all this stuff with the original. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2661.64s)]
*  Yeah, let me ask you about the data. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2663.36s)]
*  The fact that that Pfizer only has this product to sell is not exactly [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2664.72s)]
*  a ringing endorsement of their behavior. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2668.2s)]
*  But let's stay on the data for a second. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2669.44s)]
*  There was a study in Nature, which is, you know, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2671.7999999999997s)]
*  one of the most preeminent scientific journals about the risks of myocarditis [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2674.44s)]
*  and pericarditis, which is basically inflammation of the heart tissue, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2679.2000000000003s)]
*  which can basically lead to heart attacks, saying that the risk among young people, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2683.12s)]
*  especially young men in 18 to 24 years, was elevated if they got the vaccine. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2688.4s)]
*  This was a study out of France. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2694.48s)]
*  So it's pretty clear that the vaccine wasn't as efficacious [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2698.12s)]
*  as we thought, but is it less safe than we thought as well? [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2702.92s)]
*  I generally don't know the answer to this. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2705.76s)]
*  I would like to know. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2707.84s)]
*  It's an important question, and there's a lot of work being done to uncover it. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2709.12s)]
*  And here's a link to a paper that was published. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2712.7200000000003s)]
*  In the journal, Circulation [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2716.0s)]
*  is the name of the journal not too long ago [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2719.12s)]
*  by a team led by a researcher at Mass General. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2722.32s)]
*  And what this and so just to address the myocarditis question. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2725.56s)]
*  And just so everyone that's listening knows, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2730.04s)]
*  I take a very objective view on all this stuff. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2732.52s)]
*  I don't have a strong bias one way or the other. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2734.24s)]
*  So the Mass General team identified 16 people that had myocarditis [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2736.96s)]
*  that were vaccinated and 45 people that didn't were part of their control group. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2740.96s)]
*  And they tried to understand what the difference was between these two groups. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2745.48s)]
*  There have historically been three kind of theories about why there is [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2749.12s)]
*  incidence of myocarditis in certain populations that get the COVID vaccine. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2752.2s)]
*  And by the way, the incidence rate is still typically less than two [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2757.2s)]
*  out of every 100,000 people that get the vaccine. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2760.6s)]
*  But as you saw in the paper you just shared and others have validated it, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2763.3999999999996s)]
*  it can be as high as 30 times more likely to happen in young people [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2766.64s)]
*  that take the Moderna vaccine, which is still a low incidence, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2770.56s)]
*  but 30 times higher is significant and worth understanding. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2773.8399999999997s)]
*  So the three kind of reasons or the three ideas that I need times higher. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2777.64s)]
*  That sounds like a lot. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2780.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. So the reason and off a small base, but yes. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2782.0s)]
*  And so the three ideas or the three theories around why this is happening. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2784.8s)]
*  Number one is what's called protein mimicry, where certain people, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2788.6000000000004s)]
*  the protein on their their heart tissue, for example, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2792.1200000000003s)]
*  or certain proteins found in the cells in their heart tissue, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2795.28s)]
*  maybe look like some element of the spike protein that's created by the vaccine. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2797.6800000000003s)]
*  Therefore, when you make antibodies to bind to and clear your body of spike [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2803.0800000000004s)]
*  protein, it's also binding to your own cells and causing an autoimmune [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2807.48s)]
*  response. And those are called kind of auto antibodies. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2812.0s)]
*  The second is just general immune system activation that maybe genetically [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2815.08s)]
*  some people are predisposed to having a very active immune system in response [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2818.16s)]
*  to the vaccine. And therefore, with a very active immune system, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2821.36s)]
*  they get inflammation and damage. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2823.68s)]
*  And then the third is this idea that there's just massive proliferation [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2824.84s)]
*  of your B cells, some of which have auto antibodies and some of which [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2828.52s)]
*  therefore destroy your heart tissue and cause this inflammation. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2831.92s)]
*  So what this team did is they looked at the blood difference between [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2834.6s)]
*  people that had myocarditis and people that had myocarditis. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2837.44s)]
*  They found no auto antibodies. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2839.7599999999998s)]
*  They found no big changes in the T or B cell populations, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2841.04s)]
*  meaning that there isn't a big immune system activation difference. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2843.8399999999997s)]
*  The big difference that they found was that the people that had. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2847.0s)]
*  Myocarditis actually had a lot of the spike protein floating around [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2851.64s)]
*  in their blood, whereas the people that didn't did not have the spike [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2856.3999999999996s)]
*  protein floating around in their blood. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2859.0s)]
*  So this answers one question, but it opens up many more doors, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2860.4399999999996s)]
*  which is what's really going on. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2864.24s)]
*  And so what we're seeing is that the people that had myocarditis [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2865.52s)]
*  which is what's really going on. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2868.52s)]
*  So if you have spike protein in your blood and your body's not clearing it. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2869.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2873.52s)]
*  Well, how long after getting vaccinated were the spike proteins still floating around? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2873.84s)]
*  Because I remember when the mRNA vaccine first came out, they said [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2877.84s)]
*  it would the spike proteins would go away after a couple of days. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2880.88s)]
*  Three weeks. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2883.64s)]
*  Three weeks after. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2885.08s)]
*  Have they done a study like, you know, six months after or a year after? [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2886.24s)]
*  Not yet, but that's that's being done right now. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2889.8s)]
*  So what they're identifying is what's going on with the immune system of these [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2891.7599999999998s)]
*  this population where their body is not able to clear the spike protein. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2895.52s)]
*  And when their body doesn't clear the spike protein, a bunch of cytokines [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2899.36s)]
*  and other inflammatory things start to get released and it causes inflammation [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2902.52s)]
*  on the heart tissue because, you know, there's a particular set of reasons. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2906.4s)]
*  Wait, Jake, let me ask you, I remember I remember when, you know, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2910.2s)]
*  the vaccine first came out, I remember Rogan almost got canceled [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2914.12s)]
*  for saying that if he was a young person, a young man, he's like 50. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2919.68s)]
*  So he got vaccinated, but he said that if I was a young person [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2923.2799999999997s)]
*  in my 20s, I would not get vaccinated because I don't think the risk [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2926.2s)]
*  return makes sense, and he almost got canceled for that. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2930.52s)]
*  Was Rogan right about that? [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2933.7599999999998s)]
*  So, you know. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2935.9199999999996s)]
*  I have been thinking a lot about. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2938.52s)]
*  This decision to get vaccinated or not and how we came to that decision. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2941.4399999999996s)]
*  And then I think what Freebrook said earlier is super interesting. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2945.68s)]
*  The because the virus mutated, the efficacy of these vaccines [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2949.04s)]
*  obviously changed and wasn't necessary. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2953.48s)]
*  And so I think it was a moving target to understand [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2956.52s)]
*  if you should take it or not. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2960.72s)]
*  It was a very personal decision. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2961.7599999999998s)]
*  Clearly, for people who were over 65 years old, the chances of dying [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2962.9599999999996s)]
*  were pretty significant for people under that a certain age. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2967.52s)]
*  It was lower. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2971.04s)]
*  So everybody had to make a very personal decision here. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2971.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, wait, hold on a second. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2974.12s)]
*  Hold on a second. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2975.72s)]
*  Was it a personal decision when you had vaccine mandates? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2976.28s)]
*  And then on top of that, on top of that, you had the media [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2980.2000000000003s)]
*  were dunking on anti-vaxxers throughout 2021. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2984.84s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2988.28s)]
*  I mean, they were saying about anti-vaxxers that that if you didn't [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2989.0s)]
*  get the vaccine, you got sick. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2992.1200000000003s)]
*  There wouldn't be a hospital bed for you. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2993.36s)]
*  There was a lot of like dancing on the graves of these people. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2995.32s)]
*  Yeah, where, you know, there were like all these articles that, you know, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=2998.8s)]
*  that be like some preacher who, you know, said, you know, you know, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3001.48s)]
*  who, you know, said, don't get vaccinated. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3005.04s)]
*  And then they would die of COVID. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3007.2000000000003s)]
*  And there's a lot of like morbid sort of ghoulish, like articles [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3008.32s)]
*  dancing on their graves. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3012.0s)]
*  I mean, it was not this objective personal decision. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3013.04s)]
*  There was tremendous social and legal pressure to get vaccinated. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3015.8s)]
*  You're right. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3019.48s)]
*  Was there not? [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3019.88s)]
*  You're right. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3020.6400000000003s)]
*  There was. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3021.32s)]
*  And I think part of the reason I myself got vaccinated [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3021.8s)]
*  was because I wanted to be able to travel again. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3025.6800000000003s)]
*  I wanted to be able to go to Madison Square Garden and watch the Knicks. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3027.1600000000003s)]
*  And I also thought, well, I don't want to be if I'm overweight, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3029.7200000000003s)]
*  like one of the people who dies from this. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3032.92s)]
*  So, you know, we all sat here. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3034.76s)]
*  We all got vaccinated. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3036.6400000000003s)]
*  Do we regret our decision to get vaccinated now that we see this, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3038.0800000000004s)]
*  you know, studies like maybe it wasn't necessary. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3041.0400000000004s)]
*  And also, it was apparently oversold. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3044.6800000000003s)]
*  So when the Pfizer CEO won't say when they knew it wasn't going to stop [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3046.84s)]
*  transmission, I think it's a valid question to investigate [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3050.28s)]
*  what Pfizer knew and when and just keep everybody [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3053.5200000000004s)]
*  accountable for this for future things that happen, because right now [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3056.84s)]
*  we're in a position where if Pfizer is not being honest with us, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3061.0s)]
*  if the origin story of covid isn't being honest with us, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3064.8s)]
*  these conspiracy theories are now starting to start to look like reality. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3067.44s)]
*  Let me go to you, Chamath. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3071.5600000000004s)]
*  I mean, so we were all felt this tremendous pressure [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3072.5200000000004s)]
*  in 2021 to get the vaccine. Right. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3076.44s)]
*  We all care about our health. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3080.2000000000003s)]
*  You care a lot about your health. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3081.7200000000003s)]
*  We all thought we could trust the experts that the vaccine was both [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3084.28s)]
*  efficacious and safe. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3088.36s)]
*  We know it was not efficacious in the sense that they're telling us [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3090.32s)]
*  that we have to get revaccinated every two months for it to work on safety. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3093.8s)]
*  I don't want to get over my skis because we only have some data. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3097.8s)]
*  But clearly, like this myocarditis data is not good. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3101.52s)]
*  So were we basically stampeded into making a decision [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3105.48s)]
*  that was not actually good for us? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3110.28s)]
*  And would you make that same decision today? [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3112.2400000000002s)]
*  Let's just lay the foundation for understanding how we got here. So. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3116.04s)]
*  There are these pathways inside the FDA [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3120.2000000000003s)]
*  to get drugs approved. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3123.48s)]
*  And if you take a normal pathway for a normal drug, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3125.24s)]
*  you're going to spend nine or 10 years, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3128.6s)]
*  maybe more 12, 13, in some cases, and more than a billion dollars [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3131.08s)]
*  to get a drug approved. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3135.3599999999997s)]
*  And the way that it works is in phase one, you do a study on toxicology [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3136.8399999999997s)]
*  effectively like is this safe or not safe? [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3141.48s)]
*  And you have to have enough people take it. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3144.2s)]
*  And you need to observe them for enough time where that phase one outcome [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3146.3199999999997s)]
*  essentially says this won't hurt people. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3150.7999999999997s)]
*  It's benign. We don't know the mechanism of action. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3152.96s)]
*  We don't know whether it's going to solve the problem, but we know that it's safe. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3156.12s)]
*  And then in phase two, you then try to really understand [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3160.32s)]
*  the mechanism of action. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3164.68s)]
*  And if that works, you go into phase three where you actually scale it out. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3166.52s)]
*  You create a double arm study. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3171.2400000000002s)]
*  You may do a control group. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3173.2400000000002s)]
*  You may do an open label companion. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3174.4s)]
*  You may overpower it with thousands of people. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3176.0s)]
*  And the FDA is incredibly rigorous. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3179.08s)]
*  OK, even down to like it's incredible, by the way, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3181.52s)]
*  like how you're allowed to open the results and they have all of these services [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3184.12s)]
*  that make sure that you can influence the results or manipulate them. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3188.36s)]
*  It's incredible. The FDA has an incredible process. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3192.68s)]
*  The thing is that they also have a way to jump around that fence. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3196.0s)]
*  And that is what we use for the covid-19 vaccines. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3200.08s)]
*  So in a molecule, 13 years, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3203.2s)]
*  if it's for a really important drug, you can shorten it to six or seven. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3207.48s)]
*  With this thing called breakthrough designation for a biologic. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3211.6s)]
*  12 or 13 years. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3216.8s)]
*  But if you get this thing called our mat, six or seven years. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3218.36s)]
*  So you're still talking years and thousands of people, David. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3221.92s)]
*  But then there's this one special asterisk that exists inside the FDA [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3226.04s)]
*  called emergency use authorization. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3230.16s)]
*  And in moments of deemed emergency, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3232.72s)]
*  you can shorten even six years down to in some cases, six, seven, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3235.96s)]
*  nine months, a year, two years. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3240.16s)]
*  Right. Are you describing operation warp speed? [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3242.0s)]
*  So that emergency use authorization fast track these vaccines to market. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3245.24s)]
*  Now, the thing to keep in mind is there are still two classes of vaccines. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3251.08s)]
*  There are the messenger RNA vaccines, that's the biotech and Pfizer ones. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3255.24s)]
*  And then there are the more regular ones that in many cases, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3258.6s)]
*  the West was dumping on AstraZeneca and Johnson Johnson. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3261.44s)]
*  As we used to, we used to ship those to developing countries and say, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3264.3999999999996s)]
*  we'll just keep the M.R.N.A. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3267.96s)]
*  once you guys think Dave Chappelle had this funny joke. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3269.8s)]
*  He's like, I took the J&J vaccine. Right. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3272.16s)]
*  But it turns out that now when we're looking back, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3275.6s)]
*  the long tail of issues may actually apply to these things that were fast [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3279.12s)]
*  tracked, these mRNA vaccines that were fast tracked under emergency use. Why? [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3282.92s)]
*  Because of what Friedberg said, this protein mimicry thing is something [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3286.64s)]
*  we don't understand. Now, why don't we understand it? [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3290.08s)]
*  It's because our tools are not precise enough [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3292.88s)]
*  to exactly know when we engineer these solutions, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3296.6400000000003s)]
*  that it only binds to this specific protein. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3302.0s)]
*  And what we're learning is that these proteins are some they're so similar [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3307.0400000000004s)]
*  that there can be a little collateral damage that this other thing that looks [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3312.44s)]
*  99 percent will also all of a sudden attract this. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3315.96s)]
*  This antigen. So this is a very complicated body of problem. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3321.4s)]
*  And because we didn't give it enough time to bake in the wild, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3326.76s)]
*  we're learning about this thing in real time. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3330.6000000000004s)]
*  If you if we had gone to what you had suggested, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3332.6800000000003s)]
*  which is a massive masking mandate while this stuff played out, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3335.5600000000004s)]
*  could the outcome be different? [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3340.36s)]
*  Well, we don't know because we didn't make those decisions. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3341.6400000000003s)]
*  But I think that's what people will be debating. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3344.6400000000003s)]
*  The last thing I'll say on this is specifically to myocarditis. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3346.4s)]
*  I have an interventional cardiologist in L.A. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3350.6000000000004s)]
*  I've seen him every three years, ever since Goldie passed away. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3352.68s)]
*  Out of respect for Goldie and Cheryl, who initially asked me to go. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3357.24s)]
*  But it's been a great thing that I've done. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3360.44s)]
*  I've learned a lot from him. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3362.72s)]
*  He introduced me to PCSK9 inhibitors and a bunch of things. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3363.7999999999997s)]
*  He called me two years ago and said, I want to do a study that were a year ago. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3367.72s)]
*  I want to do a study that looks at actually myocarditis [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3372.0s)]
*  and the effects of this vaccine. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3376.24s)]
*  And Nick, I don't know if you can just throw it up, but we published something. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3378.44s)]
*  And basically, you know, what we see, David, is that for folks with myocarditis, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3381.24s)]
*  you're releasing troponin. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3386.2s)]
*  And this is a this is a protein that you would otherwise use to figure out [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3388.0s)]
*  whether you're having a heart attack or severe, you know, some sort of heart abnormality. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3392.64s)]
*  And so it just goes to show you that there is some collateral damage in some cases. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3398.2799999999997s)]
*  In this example, this is one case that we published, which is a 63 year old [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3402.6s)]
*  white woman. I'm saying that implicitly so that people understand [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3407.08s)]
*  that these things really matter on age, gender and race. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3410.12s)]
*  All of the data that comes out of France really was focused on, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3414.72s)]
*  I think it was 18 to 34 year old males of all racial persuasions. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3417.3199999999997s)]
*  And we've thought that this issue is prevalent only in males, but [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3423.16s)]
*  we've had a few cases that we've talked about now that touch women as well. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3428.08s)]
*  So it's a complicated set of things because our tools are not fine [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3431.8399999999997s)]
*  grain enough to engineer the drug for incredible [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3437.12s)]
*  specificity. And I think that's the thing that we're dealing with now. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3441.68s)]
*  And by the way, last thing. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3446.16s)]
*  Because of all this, it probably is reasonable to take a step back [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3449.44s)]
*  and have a commission that just uncovers all of this stuff. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3453.12s)]
*  Look, we've had commissions for I totally agree. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3455.7999999999997s)]
*  We need an investigation usage in baseball, like if we need an investigation. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3457.96s)]
*  And this goes back, this goes back to the rebel news, asking [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3462.64s)]
*  Burla a very simple question, which is, what did you know? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3466.72s)]
*  And what did you know with respect to the efficacy and safety of these vaccines? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3469.68s)]
*  If they did not tell the public that these vaccines did not work [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3472.9599999999996s)]
*  the way they were supposed to because they want to keep minting money. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3476.3199999999997s)]
*  That is a legitimate scandal. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3479.3599999999997s)]
*  We have a right to know. But Freeberg, let me ask you a question here. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3480.72s)]
*  I think, you know, Chamath talked about this sort of sped up process [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3483.4799999999996s)]
*  to cut through red tape and get a vaccine to market more quickly. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3488.52s)]
*  I personally actually think that that kind of process is fine [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3492.4799999999996s)]
*  for patients who want to assume the risk, you know, as sort of a libertarian. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3495.8799999999997s)]
*  I support that. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3500.0s)]
*  But I go back to the fact that people in many places were not given a choice. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3501.2s)]
*  They had to get vaccinated. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3506.52s)]
*  Or they could lose their job or their freedom to participate in society. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3508.9599999999996s)]
*  And now we're finding out that they may have been forced to do something [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3514.9199999999996s)]
*  that in their particular case may not really have been a great cost [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3517.7599999999998s)]
*  benefit decision for them. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3521.9199999999996s)]
*  What do you think that the sort of impact is going to be? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3524.24s)]
*  Of this, just like socially, I mean, you've talked about, I think that there's a [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3528.9599999999996s)]
*  decline in trust of institutional authority in the US. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3534.24s)]
*  And that's a huge problem. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3538.9599999999996s)]
*  I mean, isn't this going to contribute to that? [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3540.16s)]
*  Yeah, look, I mean, I think that there's been. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3542.24s)]
*  Institutional authority overreach. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3544.88s)]
*  That's been building for quite some time. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3547.84s)]
*  And, you know, look, I mean, you guys can go back to our first episode [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3550.1600000000003s)]
*  and our earliest episodes, and I wasn't and haven't been. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3553.6400000000003s)]
*  And I think the first time I tweeted, [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3556.84s)]
*  I tweeted about the adverse impact that lockdowns could have, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3559.52s)]
*  and we should be weighing the cost of the lockdowns against the benefit. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3563.04s)]
*  And ultimately, the benefit was zero because we ended up accumulating, [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3566.48s)]
*  call it 10 trillion dollars of of, you know, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3570.56s)]
*  four trillion dollars of net costs that we have to pay off at some point, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3573.6s)]
*  not to mention the economic consequences of the lockdowns. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3577.1200000000003s)]
*  And, you know, the benefit was negligible [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3582.28s)]
*  because the virus continued to spread and evolve, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3585.0s)]
*  and there was no way to really stop the virus in its tracks. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3588.0s)]
*  Hindsight is 2020, fog of war, lawmakers made decisions. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3592.08s)]
*  Was it the right decision? Would you have made the same decision? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3596.96s)]
*  It's really hard to say. You feel like you're saving the world. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3599.04s)]
*  When the world is ending, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3601.44s)]
*  it's easy to kind of act with some degree of what is now viewed as overreach. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3603.04s)]
*  I do think that the mass vaccination requirement [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3607.0s)]
*  may have also been deemed overreach, given the limited data that was available [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3610.44s)]
*  and the rapid evolution that was pretty apparent in the virus at the time as well. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3614.52s)]
*  But vaccines are required for a number of other. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3619.04s)]
*  Illnesses in a number of school systems around the country. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3623.0s)]
*  You know, you start to question, [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3627.8s)]
*  I think we will start to see people question whether those are appropriate. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3629.6s)]
*  But again, those are longer studied, better understood. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3632.72s)]
*  The cost benefit analysis is as much there. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3636.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, actually, I think I think you're right that one of the costs of this policy [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3639.48s)]
*  is going to be that people will stop trusting vaccination in general, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3643.7599999999998s)]
*  even though I think that these covid vaccines, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3648.24s)]
*  I'm not even sure you can really call them vaccines. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3652.16s)]
*  I mean, every other vaccine that I've ever heard of completely prevents [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3653.88s)]
*  that disease. The polio vaccine ended polio. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3658.64s)]
*  The MMR vaccine ended measles, mumps and rubella. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3661.84s)]
*  The covid vaccine just didn't work. I don't think it was a vaccine. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3665.4s)]
*  But I think now what's going to happen is people are going to have a lot more distrust. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3668.44s)]
*  There's a tremendous amount of post activity rationalization going on, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3672.8s)]
*  where once you kind of made a statement that the vaccine will stop [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3678.64s)]
*  transmission of the virus or stop hospitalizations, and suddenly it doesn't. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3682.7200000000003s)]
*  And you've made that statement with such surety and brevity [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3687.04s)]
*  and funded it with so much money and caused such cost in doing so. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3691.36s)]
*  At that point, you're too far removed to go back and say, you know what, it doesn't. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3695.44s)]
*  And as we're seeing now, the consequences of not being willing to say [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3699.7599999999998s)]
*  that you were wrong may be far greater. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3702.88s)]
*  Then the consequences of kind of continuing [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3706.16s)]
*  or kind of making this change. So it's a good point. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3709.8s)]
*  All right. Final question to Jake, on that point. Yeah. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3713.32s)]
*  So, I mean, Jake, look, you were dunking or at least [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3715.92s)]
*  concerned trolling on anti-vaxxers during this time period. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3719.7999999999997s)]
*  Do you reconsider that? [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3723.24s)]
*  I mean, in other words, everybody was saying that the anti-vaxxers [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3725.04s)]
*  were these stupid, unsophisticated people. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3727.84s)]
*  Wow. Yeah, I I think that maybe but maybe it was the elites [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3730.68s)]
*  who were the ones suffering from group think. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3735.52s)]
*  I mean, look, and I put myself in this bucket. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3737.36s)]
*  We will all heard it into this idea. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3739.44s)]
*  We all took the vaccine. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3742.44s)]
*  Being an early adopter of a product. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3743.2400000000002s)]
*  And now we're finding out that it certainly didn't do what it said. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3745.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, in fairness, we said we knew this was experimental. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3748.6s)]
*  We knew this was the first time mRNA. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3751.48s)]
*  But we also knew like a billion people had gotten them or we when we got ours, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3753.6800000000003s)]
*  we knew hundreds of millions of them. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3757.4s)]
*  And the mRNA, hold on. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3759.2400000000002s)]
*  Let me just ask the questions. Let me finish. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3760.7200000000003s)]
*  And so I think people made a risk assessment [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3763.04s)]
*  knowing this was an experimental vaccine, knowing that the covid [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3766.1600000000003s)]
*  was mutating at the time. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3770.64s)]
*  And yeah, it could have been oversold, of course. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3772.8799999999997s)]
*  That that seems to be the case. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3775.44s)]
*  All right, Nick, pull up this tweet. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3777.56s)]
*  But, you know, we need to I think we have to look at [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3779.24s)]
*  because we had this conversation, you and I, of you were very [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3783.7599999999998s)]
*  much in favor of everybody getting the mandate [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3788.6s)]
*  and everybody being forced to get the vaccine. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3792.0s)]
*  I never supported the mandate. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3794.64s)]
*  You did. We had a conversation about that. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3796.12s)]
*  Like, should people be able to work? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3797.68s)]
*  Should people go on trains? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3799.08s)]
*  And your position was people shouldn't be able to go on trains. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3800.44s)]
*  No, I did not support a mandate. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3803.68s)]
*  I thought it should always be people's choice. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3805.72s)]
*  I did believe that. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3807.2s)]
*  Hold on. I made the mistake. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3808.56s)]
*  I made the mistake of believing the experts in the mainstream media. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3811.0s)]
*  I think if the last couple of years have taught us anything, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3814.88s)]
*  it's that they can't be trusted. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3817.24s)]
*  The level of distrust we should have is even greater than we thought. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3818.8s)]
*  I never supported a mandate because I thought it should be people's choice. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3821.4s)]
*  And I certainly wasn't. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3825.6s)]
*  I don't think I was dunking on the anti-vaxxers. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3826.8s)]
*  Let's pull up this tweet, Nick. Yeah. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3829.6400000000003s)]
*  My Lord, Trump is cronies of Fox News are killing their own constituents [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3833.6000000000004s)]
*  with this anti-vaxx nonsense. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3836.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Do you retract that? [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3838.7200000000003s)]
*  Do I retract it? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3844.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm trying to look at the date. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3847.0s)]
*  By the way, this is this is a tweet that Jason put out. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3848.0800000000004s)]
*  What was the date? [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3850.6400000000003s)]
*  Fed Jan 4th. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3852.04s)]
*  Twenty twenty two, that's pulled up just so. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3854.28s)]
*  Yeah, that was only a year ago. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3855.84s)]
*  Yeah, I know. At this point, people were saying that. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3857.92s)]
*  No, I get it. I get it. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3861.84s)]
*  Yes. This is not this is not a rare. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3862.96s)]
*  This is not a rare sentiment, but I'm saying just to give this. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3865.6000000000004s)]
*  You still stand by this. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3868.32s)]
*  Well, hold on a second. I'm just reading it. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3869.6000000000004s)]
*  This was showing the deaths of from Covid [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3872.1600000000003s)]
*  were happening at a magnitude more by people who didn't take the vaccine. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3876.04s)]
*  And we know the vaccine was. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3880.04s)]
*  Had reduced deaths. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3883.32s)]
*  So we still know that, correct, Freeberg? [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3884.96s)]
*  The vaccine reduced reduces the cases of deaths, correct? [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3887.04s)]
*  Yeah, this new bivalent booster, Eric Topol put out a tweet. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3891.12s)]
*  I gave you guys the link here where he covered a paper [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3894.92s)]
*  that was done recently. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3898.96s)]
*  And the paper shows a reduction in hospitalization rate and death rate [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3900.32s)]
*  for folks that are getting this new bivalent booster. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3904.52s)]
*  So but again, that is a benefit. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3906.56s)]
*  That is the benefit, yeah. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3909.56s)]
*  In one's own kind of personal safety. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3910.84s)]
*  And there's a risk profile associated with that, as Sax is pointing out. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3912.92s)]
*  But this notion that the vaccines stop the virus and are a true vaccine [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3915.88s)]
*  in the sense of how we talk about polio and chicken pot or smallpox [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3920.88s)]
*  and this other stuff. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3924.28s)]
*  Not equivalent. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3926.04s)]
*  Very different. Wait, that data, how long after vaccination was that data? [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3927.6400000000003s)]
*  Because I thought that with respect to the vaccine, one of the big problems [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3931.36s)]
*  is that the benefits only last for two months, [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3934.6800000000003s)]
*  unless you're willing to get revaccinated every two months. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3937.6s)]
*  No, that's not really realistic. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3940.44s)]
*  Generally speaking, this is not like a vaccine in the sense of a. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3943.12s)]
*  Smallpox or right, this is a shot. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3949.64s)]
*  It's a it's a it's a modest muting of the effects, [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3953.48s)]
*  and it's one that people need to take kind of a risk based decision [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3956.7200000000003s)]
*  on for one's personal thing, but having mandates on whether or not [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3959.8s)]
*  you can go to school and whether or not you can, you know, be in places [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3963.08s)]
*  and whether or not it's appropriate for a workplace setting. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3967.0s)]
*  There's still high degrees of infectiousness with this ever evolving virus. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3970.44s)]
*  The virus that we have today is not the virus that we had in February of 2020. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3973.52s)]
*  It's a very different virus. And. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3978.36s)]
*  It has evolved to such an extent now, and it's continuing to evolve [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3981.52s)]
*  that it's very difficult to say there's a vaccine for this virus. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3984.8s)]
*  It's it's it's a why won't you just say that this [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3987.84s)]
*  the so-called vaccine has been a failure. We don't know. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3992.48s)]
*  Hold on. I'm going to fail. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3994.64s)]
*  You're we don't we don't know the full safety implications. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=3996.36s)]
*  Like I said, I don't want to get too far out of my skis on that. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4000.28s)]
*  However, yeah, we know the efficaciousness of it has been a failure. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4002.92s)]
*  For that, it doesn't last long enough. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4007.2s)]
*  Unless you're going to get [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4009.2s)]
*  reducing, unless you're going to get jabbed six times a year, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4010.32s)]
*  which I don't think anybody here would do that. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4013.28s)]
*  So I think doesn't work. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4015.88s)]
*  Sorry, because it's we hold on. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4016.96s)]
*  There was a time period where it was effective. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4018.96s)]
*  Correct, Friedberg, and it did reduce that massively. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4022.8s)]
*  So I think that's the issue that we're talking about here is that now [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4025.44s)]
*  the covid strains are so weak that maybe it's not as necessary. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4028.6s)]
*  But there was a time period where people were not taking the vaccine [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4032.12s)]
*  and Republicans specifically weren't taking the vaccine [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4035.88s)]
*  and they were dying at a much higher percentage. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4038.56s)]
*  So it didn't if you're defying the vaccine is not getting [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4040.68s)]
*  not transferring the disease. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4044.16s)]
*  Sure, it was a failure. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4045.8399999999997s)]
*  It didn't block like we thought it would. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4047.16s)]
*  It only works in terms of reducing death, reducing death. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4048.7599999999998s)]
*  It did work for a period of time. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4051.48s)]
*  If it only lasted for two months and covid is still around [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4053.4s)]
*  and it's basically endemic, it's everywhere. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4056.68s)]
*  How did the vaccine make any difference whatsoever? [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4059.3599999999997s)]
*  I think now it's two months, but back then it wasn't. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4061.24s)]
*  But, you know, Friedberg, Friedberg, is that true? [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4063.48s)]
*  What's the question? [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4067.08s)]
*  I'm losing track of how long does the the lowering, the percentage of deaths, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4068.3199999999997s)]
*  the benefits of it, yes, of reducing what we've learned [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4073.9199999999996s)]
*  is they only last two months. Is that true? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4077.52s)]
*  Yeah, it depends on the population. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4079.56s)]
*  And yes, there is a decline in the benefit over time, [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4081.9199999999996s)]
*  as well as the fact that the virus is evolving. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4085.52s)]
*  Those are both two kind of independent things. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4087.88s)]
*  And as a result, over time, you know, like, yeah, we got to keep getting boosted [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4090.36s)]
*  or shots and fighters making a great business out of it. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4094.16s)]
*  You're right. There's a massive economic incentive here for them in Moderna [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4096.48s)]
*  to keep this great gravy train rolling. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4099.96s)]
*  And there's a massive incentive for government officials, politicians [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4102.28s)]
*  to continue to stand by what they said before, because otherwise [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4105.8s)]
*  they're going to be called wrong and they're going to get beat up. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4109.04s)]
*  Totally. And I feel like I feel like you're making an effort. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4111.12s)]
*  You're making an effort to stand by what you previously said. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4114.72s)]
*  The market is just come out. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4117.16s)]
*  I think we should just come out and say that, look, regardless of where [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4118.6s)]
*  the safety data ultimately comes out, just based on efficaciousness, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4121.200000000001s)]
*  we can say that this thing didn't work and therefore mandating it [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4124.92s)]
*  was an even worse thing because hold on, we put every we put the drug [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4129.200000000001s)]
*  through this rapid process and we didn't let people make [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4132.8s)]
*  an individual cost benefit decision. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4135.56s)]
*  We basically herded them into this. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4137.64s)]
*  And at best, it didn't do very much. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4140.360000000001s)]
*  I don't think that that decision, if you if you make that conclusion, [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4142.92s)]
*  I'm not sure that it gives us a toolkit to do better the next time. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4146.0s)]
*  And I think we've all said this and Friedberg was the one that first [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4150.68s)]
*  really taught us about this. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4153.76s)]
*  There will be a next time, unfortunately. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4154.72s)]
*  So I think that we have to focus our energy here in acknowledging that [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4158.08s)]
*  the tools that we have. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4163.64s)]
*  To create these messenger RNA vaccines and other types of solutions, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4166.52s)]
*  we are pushing the boundaries of science and the body is still very [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4171.200000000001s)]
*  poorly understood. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4174.280000000001s)]
*  And so the sensitivity and specificity of these drugs may not be what we think [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4175.68s)]
*  up front. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4180.280000000001s)]
*  And as a result of that, maybe we need to find a different way of using [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4181.56s)]
*  emergency use authorization in the future. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4186.88s)]
*  And I don't know, David, to your point, I'm beyond my ski tips on scientific [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4190.56s)]
*  knowledge to know how. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4196.76s)]
*  But I'd say a minimum, I would say as a minimum that if we're going to do [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4198.48s)]
*  emergency use, it shouldn't be mandated. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4201.96s)]
*  Let patients and doctors decide on their own. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4204.36s)]
*  OK, let's move on. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4206.64s)]
*  So we have a moment of agreement. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4207.48s)]
*  One question for Friedberg, would you advise or in your life, would you [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4208.88s)]
*  consider would you continue to get a booster or are you going to consider [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4213.44s)]
*  getting a booster every year if they keep coming with them? [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4216.92s)]
*  And now would you advise parents or, you know, adults over 65 or 70 to get one? [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4219.52s)]
*  Because those seem to be the high risk group, right? [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4225.32s)]
*  So if your parents said, should I get it or not? [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4227.32s)]
*  I would advise them to talk to their doctor and their doctor would advise [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4230.24s)]
*  them to do it. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4233.12s)]
*  What do you think most doctors would tell somebody above 65 or 70 at this point? [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4234.04s)]
*  It depends what state they're in at this point. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4238.72s)]
*  But basically, we'd be split on political lines. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4240.2s)]
*  Unless this virus turns into Ebola, I'm never getting boosted again. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4244.6s)]
*  I'll tell you that right now. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4248.2s)]
*  I do agree with that. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4249.72s)]
*  And Friedberg agrees. What about you guys? [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4250.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm not getting boosted again, no. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4252.12s)]
*  I think that speaks volumes. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4254.4s)]
*  That speaks volumes right there. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4255.68s)]
*  That's why. That's it. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4256.96s)]
*  World's first mother. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4257.8s)]
*  Like we could have just done this in 10 seconds. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4259.16s)]
*  What about you guys? We are literally not... [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4261.4400000000005s)]
*  This channel will be banned on every platform. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4262.8s)]
*  Let's move on. Let's move on. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4264.6s)]
*  Friedberg, but the fact that all of us can arrive at that and then we're worried [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4266.52s)]
*  about getting banned tells you how screwed up our society is. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4271.08s)]
*  Like what? We can't like have an honest conversation about this. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4276.0s)]
*  By the way, the other thing this is going to do, it's going to inflame a large [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4279.320000000001s)]
*  number of people just hearing us say this. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4281.84s)]
*  Because people have these deep... [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4283.84s)]
*  What's happened is this has now become a sense of identity, a sense of tribalism [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4285.160000000001s)]
*  and a sense of it's a belief system. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4289.4400000000005s)]
*  It's no longer about an objective decision. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4291.160000000001s)]
*  Well, we saw this with the mask. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4293.040000000001s)]
*  The mask became the blue equivalent of the red maga hat. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4294.320000000001s)]
*  And the vaccine has basically, you know, it's become tribal. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4298.120000000001s)]
*  But people need to move beyond that because this is a scientific question of [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4302.400000000001s)]
*  costs and benefits related to this medical treatment. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4307.64s)]
*  OK, let's just move on. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4311.160000000001s)]
*  There's too much other stuff to talk about. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4312.040000000001s)]
*  There's not four venture capitalists about your vaccine plan. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4313.24s)]
*  Totally agree. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4317.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4318.04s)]
*  Speak to your doctor. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4318.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4319.24s)]
*  Speak to your doctor. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4319.639999999999s)]
*  Please don't listen to us. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4320.4s)]
*  All right. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4321.719999999999s)]
*  Let's move on. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4323.04s)]
*  We're as confused as you are. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4324.04s)]
*  By the way, by the way, speak to your doctor and just remember, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4324.679999999999s)]
*  vaccine manufacturers have a business to run and politicians have to get reelected. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4327.679999999999s)]
*  All right, let's move on because we've got to stuck on this. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4332.08s)]
*  OK, look, there's been some important developments in Ukraine. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4334.88s)]
*  I think we should just cover quickly this week. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4337.04s)]
*  There are a bunch of things. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4338.88s)]
*  The Biden administration said they're going to send Abrams tanks [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4339.72s)]
*  as well as Bradley's and Leopard 2's. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4342.96s)]
*  The Abrams tank in particular is our best, most expensive tank. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4346.4400000000005s)]
*  At the beginning of the war, they said they would not send them. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4351.0s)]
*  So they reversed their decision on that. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4353.320000000001s)]
*  Now the Ukrainians are saying they want jets as well. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4355.16s)]
*  That's sort of the next issue is going to come up. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4357.76s)]
*  The Biden administration also in a New York Times article that came out earlier [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4360.12s)]
*  this week said that they were warming to the idea of supporting an invasion of Crimea. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4363.92s)]
*  Some Europeans like Peter Hitchens are getting very nervous [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4371.56s)]
*  about this level of escalation. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4374.24s)]
*  He had a pretty amazing piece talking about the risk of this creating nuclear war. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4375.52s)]
*  And even if the Ukrainians prevail in this war, [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4380.2s)]
*  there was a really interesting statement by Larry Fink at Davos last week, [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4384.08s)]
*  saying that he estimated the cost of reconstruction at 750 billion dollars. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4388.64s)]
*  And Fitch Ratings Agency says that Ukraine is headed towards default. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4393.48s)]
*  So major, major developments, I think, in the war this week. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4397.92s)]
*  I want to get your guys opinion on this. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4401.88s)]
*  We know from history that wars tend to escalate [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4404.92s)]
*  and to be far more costly than the participants ever thought. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4408.4s)]
*  Is that the track we're on now? [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4411.599999999999s)]
*  And in hindsight, knowing what we know now, should we regret that we didn't use [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4414.2s)]
*  every diplomatic tool we had to prevent the war, most notably taking NATO expansion [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4417.88s)]
*  off the table? Freeburg, I'll go to you. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4422.04s)]
*  It's such a tough. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4425.88s)]
*  Situation, which is a situation escalating to a point where we should be concerned. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4428.84s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of information we don't have, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4434.5199999999995s)]
*  and there's a lot of intelligence gathering [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4437.04s)]
*  and conversations and chatter that we're not privy to. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4440.28s)]
*  So to sit here and kind of be an armchair mechanic. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4445.64s)]
*  I don't know what diplomatic conversations have gone on or are going on. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4448.88s)]
*  All I know is what we're reading on the Internet. Right. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4455.24s)]
*  So I'm not nobody. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4457.44s)]
*  This war is extremely well covered. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4461.679999999999s)]
*  And there are no diplomatic conversations going on. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4463.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So I we are escalating the war. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4466.08s)]
*  I mean, we get Jake Haller-Tremont in here. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4469.5199999999995s)]
*  Do you guys have any concerns about the direction this is headed at all? [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4471.88s)]
*  Yes, I'm concerned. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4475.76s)]
*  I also agree with Freeburg that I don't think we have all the information. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4477.160000000001s)]
*  But I'm not exactly sure what we can do right now. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4482.160000000001s)]
*  It seems like they have decided [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4485.320000000001s)]
*  that there is a play to exert a lot of pressure come the spring. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4489.200000000001s)]
*  And that's something that you've mentioned as a very likely thing. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4493.8s)]
*  And so I guess the calculus on the ground is that there's a way [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4497.76s)]
*  to really push Russia into a corner. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4500.8s)]
*  And the only way to do that is with more military support. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4503.88s)]
*  And then on the heels of that, David, the link that you sent is then [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4509.8s)]
*  it's not just the war machine that is now spinning up, but it's the aftermarket. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4513.72s)]
*  Financial services infrastructure that's also spinning up for Larry. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4518.84s)]
*  Larry Fink, the grift aspect of this war. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4522.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, Larry Fink was like, hey, they're going to need [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4524.2s)]
*  three quarters of a trillion dollars of reconstruction support. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4527.36s)]
*  We saw that play out in Iraq as well. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4531.92s)]
*  Where at first it was the war machine and then it was the reconstruction machine. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4533.64s)]
*  And together it was trillions and trillions. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4537.200000000001s)]
*  By the way, you know what that's called? [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4539.04s)]
*  Those are called infrastructure funds. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4540.52s)]
*  And those infrastructure funds raise hundreds of billions of dollars [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4542.92s)]
*  to make investments, to build new infrastructure in markets that need it [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4546.68s)]
*  and that are willing to pay for it. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4550.200000000001s)]
*  And it will likely end up being kind of long term debt assumed by that region [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4551.72s)]
*  to pay to do this work. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4555.64s)]
*  And the beneficiaries will be the investors and owners of those infrastructure funds. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4557.160000000001s)]
*  I think there's two sides to this, that are worth kind of noting. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4561.44s)]
*  One is the telegraphing of this decision, because it's not being done secretly. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4563.88s)]
*  It's being done out in the open. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4568.32s)]
*  There's certainly a calculus to that. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4570.56s)]
*  Why are they telegraphing this and what do they intend to do [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4572.56s)]
*  with that messaging being put out there like this? [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4575.6s)]
*  And it may be that it's to assert or assume a stronger negotiating position, [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4578.64s)]
*  certainly to go into some sort of, you know, mild, modest exit or settlement [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4583.52s)]
*  coming out of this thing. But you're right. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4587.84s)]
*  The flip side is, and the cost here is one of extreme outcome, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4589.96s)]
*  which is there may be a France-France-Ferdinand moment here [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4593.4800000000005s)]
*  where one thing goes too far and triggers a cataclysmic outcome. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4596.16s)]
*  And in this case, the cataclysmic outcome is tactical nuclear weapons [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4601.88s)]
*  and tactical nuclear weapons, as we've talked about. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4607.28s)]
*  And I think I had some conversations and some dinners. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4610.320000000001s)]
*  I shared with you guys with some folks in the intelligence community. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4613.28s)]
*  And this has been talked about by ex-intelligence community folks publicly [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4616.72s)]
*  are a key part of the Russian war playbook that this is [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4620.64s)]
*  there is a tactical nuclear weapon response system that is in place. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4625.280000000001s)]
*  And, you know, these are. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4629.84s)]
*  Very possible paths that we could find ourselves kind of walking down. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4632.16s)]
*  Obviously, were that to happen, it would be a massive escalation. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4636.04s)]
*  And you're right, there could be a France-Fernand kind of moment [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4639.52s)]
*  that emerges by shaking the cage and lighting a fire. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4642.72s)]
*  And there may be a stronger negotiating position [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4646.72s)]
*  to get to a settlement faster by doing this. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4649.6s)]
*  I don't have a strong point of view on the probability of either of those and why. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4652.4800000000005s)]
*  But I think, you know, maybe both are certainly in play here. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4656.56s)]
*  It was interesting to me that the Wall Street Journal on the heels of all of this stuff [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4660.52s)]
*  also published an article. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4663.88s)]
*  About Roman Abramovich, and the interesting thing about it [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4666.72s)]
*  was a quote in the article that effectively said something tantamount to, well, now that he's. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4669.56s)]
*  Proven not as useful. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4673.52s)]
*  We need to target him with sanctions. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4675.52s)]
*  So I just think that what all of this is, is now sort of they're entering the end game, David, [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4680.360000000001s)]
*  to use a chess analogy, and it looks like they're setting the wheels in motion [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4685.4400000000005s)]
*  to kind of put all the pieces together for a negotiated settlement. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4693.64s)]
*  Do we know that? [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4698.84s)]
*  I mean, well, but is it the end game or is it continualized? [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4699.6s)]
*  Or is it continual escalation? [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4702.64s)]
*  I mean, Jake, I actually at the beginning of the war, we didn't want to give the Ukrainians [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4704.12s)]
*  Abrams tanks because they were that was considered too provocative. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4707.64s)]
*  Now we're giving them to them. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4711.400000000001s)]
*  I think what's going on here is and I suspected this, you know, from the beginning is that [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4713.4800000000005s)]
*  we are trying to engage them in a war of attrition and it's working. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4719.240000000001s)]
*  And so I think the West collectively is trying to further that goal of just making Russia [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4723.280000000001s)]
*  economically, politically, militarily, culturally irrelevant or angled in some way. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4729.88s)]
*  And if you think about what's now happening with energy, you know, his primary export, [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4735.84s)]
*  he is going to lose those customers and his customers will be, you know, bottom feeding [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4742.16s)]
*  India, China, low cost oil. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4746.6s)]
*  And he is going to be a pariah. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4749.72s)]
*  So what I'm looking at is if there's going to be a negotiated settlement this year, what [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4751.4800000000005s)]
*  is the next five or 10 years going to look like for Russia? [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4754.6s)]
*  What is their place in the world going to be? [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4757.08s)]
*  The West is never going to trust them again. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4759.0s)]
*  The Germans are never going to buy their oil again. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4761.0s)]
*  Everybody is going to be looking for ways to distance themselves from. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4763.04s)]
*  So how does he have an exit ramp? [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4766.56s)]
*  And we talked about this from the get go here on this podcast is what's the golden [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4768.2s)]
*  bridge for him to retreat across. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4772.2s)]
*  And we really need to find that golden bridge quickly, because I do think this is [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4774.4400000000005s)]
*  starting to look desperate for him. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4779.28s)]
*  The West keeps giving better and better munitions. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4780.84s)]
*  He keeps losing economically. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4783.4400000000005s)]
*  He's going to keep losing. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4785.68s)]
*  And politically, who would ever want to engage Putin in anything with, you know, any [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4787.12s)]
*  kind of cultural or international trade? [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4792.2s)]
*  It's going to be a disaster for him. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4795.360000000001s)]
*  So this war of attrition has to resolve itself with some sort of settlement. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4798.16s)]
*  But we can't go on for two or three years, can it? [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4803.96s)]
*  I mean, it has to settle at some point. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4806.76s)]
*  I think that it certainly can go on. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4809.52s)]
*  And I think that history proves that wars tend to escalate and the costs incurred are [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4812.24s)]
*  much greater in many cases than participants ever dreamed of. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4816.72s)]
*  And if they had to go and do it all over again, they wouldn't have gotten into it in [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4821.12s)]
*  the first place. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4824.400000000001s)]
*  So, yeah, I think this is concerning. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4825.68s)]
*  I think, you know, the crazy thing is... [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4829.0s)]
*  Do you think it is a war of attrition strategy? [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4830.76s)]
*  Yeah, I think it has developed into a war of attrition. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4832.320000000001s)]
*  And I think you're right that... [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4835.360000000001s)]
*  Well, I think there's two possibilities. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4837.72s)]
*  I think there's two possibilities, J. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4840.04s)]
*  Cal. I think that the maybe the more cynical or realistic members of the [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4841.12s)]
*  administration think there's benefit in wearing Russia down and grinding them down. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4846.24s)]
*  However, I also think there's kind of a true believer camp that sees pushing Russia [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4851.2s)]
*  out of Ukraine, nothing less than that will do. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4856.12s)]
*  And we have to punish their aggression. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4858.88s)]
*  Maybe they want regime change. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4860.8s)]
*  I think there's dueling factions of the administration. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4862.2s)]
*  Remember, General Milley several months ago said that everything that the Ukrainians [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4864.12s)]
*  could achieve militarily just about had been done and they should negotiate. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4868.5199999999995s)]
*  And even Jake Sullivan had said that they should take Crimea off the table. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4872.4s)]
*  That was just the leaks a few months ago. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4876.28s)]
*  Now the administration is leaking that they're going to support a Crimean invasion. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4878.72s)]
*  So I think there's both schools within the administration, the true believers, the more [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4882.4s)]
*  cynical folks. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4888.0s)]
*  And it feels to me like the true believers are on top right now because we just keep [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4890.12s)]
*  escalating this war more and more. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4895.0s)]
*  And I think that's dangerous. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4897.12s)]
*  That polarizes the outcomes, right? [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4898.32s)]
*  So I think, Jake, if you had your way, it sounds like you would grind the Russians [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4900.88s)]
*  down, but at a certain point you would say enough is enough. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4904.12s)]
*  And like a poker player, like you do at the poker table, you'd say, have won my one [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4907.64s)]
*  my prius for the night. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4913.400000000001s)]
*  I don't need to risk that to win a Tesla. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4914.96s)]
*  So I'm going to cash in my chips and get away. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4917.04s)]
*  Walk up, walk away. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4919.4800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4920.76s)]
*  Yeah, I wish I could do that. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4922.12s)]
*  I wish I could do that consistently. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4923.64s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4925.88s)]
*  Getting up from the table is a rare skill. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4926.52s)]
*  That's right. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4929.56s)]
*  But I'm not sure the administration is getting up from the table. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4930.16s)]
*  I mean, I think we've achieved the American position on this, I think has largely [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4932.6s)]
*  been achieved. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4937.56s)]
*  We've prevented Russia from taking over Ukraine. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4938.24s)]
*  We've prevented. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4941.84s)]
*  We've basically shifted Europe onto American natural gas. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4942.8s)]
*  We've destroyed Nord Stream. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4946.76s)]
*  I think we're close to achieving our major objectives, but I'm not sure we're [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4948.64s)]
*  going to stop there. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4953.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4955.4400000000005s)]
*  All right. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4956.56s)]
*  Anyway. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4956.76s)]
*  All right. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4957.08s)]
*  Let's move on. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4957.28s)]
*  Freeberg, you have a science corner. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4957.76s)]
*  I was going to share the. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4959.24s)]
*  This was last week. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4962.24s)]
*  I think we talked about talking about it this week. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4962.96s)]
*  So there was a paper that is a pretty compelling paper published by a team led [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4965.2s)]
*  out of Harvard on identifying what may be the core driver of aging and demonstration [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4971.84s)]
*  on an ability to kind of reverse aging. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4981.16s)]
*  So I'll just start really quickly that, you know, in the human body, we have many [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4983.4s)]
*  different types of cells, right? [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4988.36s)]
*  We have 200 roughly different kinds of cells and I sell a skin cell, a brain cell, [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4989.88s)]
*  a heart cell, they all have the same DNA, the same genetic code, the same genome at [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4994.2s)]
*  the nucleus of that cell. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=4999.68s)]
*  What makes those cells different? [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5001.12s)]
*  And the reason they act and behave differently is they have different gene [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5002.4s)]
*  expression, meaning different genes in that cell are turned on and off. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5006.4s)]
*  And when a gene is turned on, the protein that that gene codes for is expressed and [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5010.48s)]
*  made in the cell and the genes that are off, those proteins are not made. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5015.68s)]
*  And remember, proteins are the biochemical machines in biology. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5019.12s)]
*  So when certain proteins are produced, they do stuff and other proteins don't do [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5022.92s)]
*  stuff and the cell acts and behaves very differently. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5026.5199999999995s)]
*  So some cells, when you turn genes on and off, you get a neuron. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5028.88s)]
*  Some cells you turn them on and off, you get a muscle cell in your bicep. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5032.12s)]
*  Some of them you get a heart cell. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5035.0s)]
*  And so all of these cells are differentiated by the genes that are expressed. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5036.96s)]
*  The general term for the expression of genes is the epigenome. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5042.8s)]
*  And an epigenome basically refers to these systems whereby there's certain parts of [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5046.639999999999s)]
*  the DNA, certain segments of genes are uncoiled a little bit. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5053.36s)]
*  So if you zoom in on DNA, you know, there's 23 chromosomes, they're tightly [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5058.92s)]
*  wrapped in these coils. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5062.88s)]
*  And when you go even closer, you see that there's these segments called nucleosomes. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5065.12s)]
*  And a nucleosome means it's like a bead and a bunch of DNA is wrapped around the [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5068.88s)]
*  bead. And how closely those beads are together, how much the DNA is wrapped [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5072.400000000001s)]
*  allows a segment of the DNA to be opened up and then expressed, meaning copies of [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5076.72s)]
*  the DNA are turned into RNA, which floats into this thing called the ribosome. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5082.12s)]
*  And the ribosome is the protein printer. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5086.4800000000005s)]
*  So the more these little segments of genome are exposed, the more they're expressed. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5088.24s)]
*  And there are certain chemicals, these methyls and acetyls that kind of attach to [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5092.4s)]
*  the genome and certain elements that allow parts of the chromosome to wrap up and get [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5096.36s)]
*  really tightly bound or to unwrap and to express the gene. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5101.5199999999995s)]
*  So the epigenome is almost you can think about it like the software and the genome or [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5105.6s)]
*  the DNA is the hardware. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5111.0s)]
*  And so the hardware basically defines what you can make. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5112.92s)]
*  The epigenome defines what is being made, what stuff is turned on and what stuff is [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5115.5199999999995s)]
*  turned off. So this paper and this work that was done, the epigenome is the [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5118.92s)]
*  way that it was done. Historically, we've always thought that aging meant that over [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5121.68s)]
*  time, the DNA in our cells was mutating and errors were accumulating in the DNA. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5125.8s)]
*  And as a result of those errors, the cells start to dysfunction. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5130.76s)]
*  And what these guys really did a good job of proving with this paper is that it may [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5134.400000000001s)]
*  not be mutations in the DNA that's causing aging, but actually changes in the epigenome [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5138.64s)]
*  and that the DNA remains pretty stable and pretty consistent over time. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5144.12s)]
*  And the way they did this is they broke the DNA. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5148.6s)]
*  So as you guys know, every second of your life, about a million breaks in DNA in cells [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5150.68s)]
*  throughout your body are happening. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5156.04s)]
*  Your DNA is being broken up. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5157.52s)]
*  And then there's all this machinery in your cell that fixes the DNA when it breaks. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5158.68s)]
*  Now, what happens when it fixes it, it turns out it's actually really good at fixing it [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5163.12s)]
*  and the DNA doesn't change. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5167.08s)]
*  And we historically thought that the DNA changed a lot and mutations accumulate over [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5168.4400000000005s)]
*  time. But in reality, what may be happening is as your DNA gets fixed, the epigenome, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5172.200000000001s)]
*  the acetyl and methyl groups on the gene, on the chromosome don't get put in the right [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5178.36s)]
*  place. And over time, what happens is the epigenome degrades. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5184.5599999999995s)]
*  And this is considered and a lot of people refer to this now as the information theory of [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5189.36s)]
*  aging. You can kind of think about making a lot of copies of software, a lot of copies of a [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5193.0s)]
*  photo and a photo printer over time. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5197.48s)]
*  And every time you make a copy, there's a little error, a little error, and those errors [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5199.719999999999s)]
*  accumulate. And the errors that accumulate cause the epigenome to change. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5202.719999999999s)]
*  And as a result, certain genes are turned on that are supposed to be off and certain genes [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5206.639999999999s)]
*  are turned off that are supposed to be turned on. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5211.28s)]
*  And then those cells start to get dysfunctional because the wrong proteins are being made in [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5213.639999999999s)]
*  the cell can no longer do what it's supposed to do. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5218.24s)]
*  So what these guys could be the ribosome as well that gets screwed up over time, the [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5220.5199999999995s)]
*  printer, the ribosome is a pretty. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5224.96s)]
*  You know, static protein, it just does its thing and there's hundreds of ribosomes in a [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5228.759999999999s)]
*  cell. So, you know, if one of them is dysfunctional, it just doesn't do anything. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5233.08s)]
*  And then the other ones kind of step in and do it. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5236.68s)]
*  So the ribosomes are constantly running. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5238.2s)]
*  What these guys did is they basically took two mice, two populations of mice, and they [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5241.2s)]
*  gave the one population of mice a certain thing that caused its DNA to break at three [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5245.48s)]
*  times the rate of the other population. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5250.88s)]
*  And then as the DNA broke, they could they could see that this mouse population got older [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5252.96s)]
*  and older faster and by a bunch of measures on how you measure age. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5258.2s)]
*  But what they did is they then measured they then sequenced the DNA of the two populations [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5262.44s)]
*  of mice. And what they showed is that the older mice, the ones that had their DNA. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5267.08s)]
*  Changing a lot, by the way, these were genetically identical mice, the ones that had [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5272.6s)]
*  their DNA broken a lot more, they had the correct genome. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5276.28s)]
*  Their genome was the exact same as the other mice that stayed young. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5279.6s)]
*  And so what that tells us is that it's the epigenome and not the DNA itself that's [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5283.76s)]
*  changing. So then here's what they did. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5288.64s)]
*  Remember, last year we talked about Yamanaka factors, which are these four proteins, these [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5290.6s)]
*  four molecules that can be applied to DNA, to a cell. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5295.04s)]
*  And they cause all of the gene expression to reset back to looking like a stem cell. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5298.96s)]
*  Remember, all of those differentiated cells come from a stem cell. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5303.72s)]
*  And when they did that, the older population of mice suddenly started to act younger and [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5307.200000000001s)]
*  all of the measures of age reversed. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5312.360000000001s)]
*  And they did this across different tissue types. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5314.76s)]
*  They measured this in a lot of different ways. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5317.080000000001s)]
*  Cognitive function, health, cellular health, etc. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5318.88s)]
*  And so it is not just a fantastic new proof point of how Yamanaka factors can actually [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5322.76s)]
*  reverse age, but it demonstrates that the epigenome itself is what is the core driver [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5328.4800000000005s)]
*  of aging. And you guys remember Altos Labs raised three billion dollars in a seed round [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5334.360000000001s)]
*  last year. And remember, at the end of 21, I said like Yamanaka factors and aging research [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5339.08s)]
*  is going to be kind of the next hot thing. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5343.360000000001s)]
*  I think this paper is going to be one of the seminal papers that really kind of illustrates [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5344.8s)]
*  and proves the point that this epigenome is the driver of aging. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5349.04s)]
*  And as we now are investing a lot of money in figuring out how Yamanaka factors and other [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5353.120000000001s)]
*  transcription factors like the Yamanaka factors can be applied in specific ways to actually [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5357.96s)]
*  reverse aging and cause the cells to start functioning correctly again, and then people [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5362.92s)]
*  will start to act and resolve in a healthy way. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5367.72s)]
*  Once again, there's a lot of work to go between here and there. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5370.4800000000005s)]
*  But now we have a much more kind of definitive proof point that this information theory of [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5373.96s)]
*  aging may be real, that it's tied to the epigenome and that there are solutions that can [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5377.320000000001s)]
*  work and we have to figure out how to put them together and how to engineer fantastic [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5381.8s)]
*  outcomes. So really great paper by a team led out of Harvard, I think really validates a [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5385.96s)]
*  lot of the work and the money that's going into the space, both in the public and the [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5391.68s)]
*  private sector. And obviously a lot of new startups kind of chasing this opportunity to [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5395.12s)]
*  figure out how we can use these transcription factors to reverse aging and that this may end [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5400.2s)]
*  up leading us to a much kind of healthy life. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5404.44s)]
*  And by the way, when they applied those Yamanaka factors to the mice, the mice lived 107 [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5407.679999999999s)]
*  percent longer than they were supposed to. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5412.639999999999s)]
*  But more importantly, the health span, as it's defined, improved. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5415.36s)]
*  So the mice not only lived longer, but they actually lived healthier. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5418.72s)]
*  They're all the measures of healthiness in the body improved. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5422.12s)]
*  So it's a really kind of powerful. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5424.8s)]
*  Is this going to help us in the next 10 years? [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5426.4s)]
*  It may. Yeah, it's very well made. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5428.76s)]
*  There are now some therapeutic. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5430.32s)]
*  Is that how long they gave you time? [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5432.76s)]
*  I feel like Science Corner should only discuss things that can happen in the next few years, [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5436.84s)]
*  let's put it that way. Or is that the wrong way to look at it? [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5442.32s)]
*  I'll tell you one way. One thing for sure, you can make you can make money as an investor [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5444.36s)]
*  over the next 10 years in finding the right teams that are going to have the highest likelihood [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5447.72s)]
*  of progressing clinical trials in this space. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5451.36s)]
*  I will say that there may be clinical trials that can come to market really fast, [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5453.5199999999995s)]
*  particularly with kind of these ex vivo therapeutics where you take cells out of your body, [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5456.92s)]
*  apply the Yamanaka factors and then put them back in your body for certain tissue types, [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5461.08s)]
*  like eye cells, for example, or T cells in your blood. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5465.08s)]
*  There's a lot of ways that this may come to market faster. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5467.76s)]
*  And it's not just about reversing your age overall, but reversing the age of certain cell [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5470.12s)]
*  types in your body that can then have profound health impacts in the near term. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5474.360000000001s)]
*  So that's the kind of stuff that's going to start to come through clinical stage sooner than later. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5477.84s)]
*  And then maybe some number of years down the road, we figure out a way to reverse the age [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5482.0s)]
*  in all the cells in our body and the whole body becomes more youthful. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5485.8s)]
*  But for now, it's going to be targeted cells in a very specific way to reverse aging and improve [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5488.96s)]
*  health. Very powerful, very interesting, lots of investment opportunity. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5493.2s)]
*  And, you know, certainly some very smart folks. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5498.28s)]
*  What do you think the realistic time frame is for, like, you know, reversing aging? [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5502.52s)]
*  Because we need that. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5508.08s)]
*  Thirty years? [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5510.64s)]
*  Shit. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5511.64s)]
*  I'll be 80. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5513.320000000001s)]
*  That's what you need the most. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5514.96s)]
*  No, but that's what you'll need the most. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5516.5199999999995s)]
*  But so, so if we live to 80, does that mean we're going to be able to live to 100 because we'll be able to reverse age? [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5518.719999999999s)]
*  Well, it depends. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5526.5199999999995s)]
*  I think the question is, can you live well to 100? [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5527.5199999999995s)]
*  I think that's the question. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5530.5599999999995s)]
*  We don't know. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5531.48s)]
*  But if you could reverse aging. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5533.0s)]
*  Yeah, but we don't know what that means, because there's all kinds of things that you inherit over time [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5534.84s)]
*  that this may not, for example, like if you have long term heart disease. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5539.5199999999995s)]
*  I could see how the cells could get healthier, but it can't eliminate the plaque in your arteries. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5543.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5549.8s)]
*  You know, that's hardened calcium. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5550.8s)]
*  So that shit's there. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5552.08s)]
*  So you have to live well. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5554.4800000000005s)]
*  Same with Alzheimer's. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5556.2s)]
*  Like Alzheimer's has plaque. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5557.2s)]
*  There's a plaque element, but the cause of that and the cellular dysfunction may be reversible. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5558.2s)]
*  It could definitely be that like injury rates of older people, hips, knees, shoulders, arms, all the sort of like soft [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5564.12s)]
*  musculoskeletal stuff you can you can really do a good job of because at the same time as you get older, like [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5571.48s)]
*  people intake less protein, they process it less well, you lose a lot of muscle mass as you get older. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5578.5599999999995s)]
*  Those are things that I think are like short term solutions. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5583.4s)]
*  But no, to be honest with you, Saks, the stuff that really can screw you, which is heart disease and brain function, [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5586.36s)]
*  this probably won't do much for a long time. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5592.92s)]
*  So check out Scrut. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5596.32s)]
*  Yeah, I'm in the best shape I've been in 20 years. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5597.36s)]
*  I feel great. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5600.44s)]
*  Can you reverse whatever is wrong with J. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5601.639999999999s)]
*  Keller's in the black category? [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5603.16s)]
*  Can I do a quality of life shout out? [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5604.679999999999s)]
*  Can I do a quality of life shout out? [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5606.679999999999s)]
*  Please. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5608.0s)]
*  I got an email. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5609.0s)]
*  We all got it from a guy who I won't say just to not to violate his [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5609.96s)]
*  privacy. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5614.919999999999s)]
*  Privacy. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5615.36s)]
*  But he's in Saskatchewan. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5616.919999999999s)]
*  He listens to the pod where his father is and made him get a prenuvo scan. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5618.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, flew the father to Vancouver. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5623.599999999999s)]
*  They found a five centimeter cancerous tumor on his kidney. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5626.08s)]
*  And three days ago had it removed and looks like guys totally healthy and [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5629.24s)]
*  eliminated. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5635.56s)]
*  Here's thing. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5636.16s)]
*  So another live saved. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5636.4800000000005s)]
*  But I but I wanted to show you guys a picture. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5639.72s)]
*  So yesterday I went to Los Angeles to see my interventional cardiologist. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5641.4800000000005s)]
*  And what they do is they do what's called a contrast CT scan. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5647.16s)]
*  So they put you into an IV and they put this contrast inside of your neck. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5650.280000000001s)]
*  You want to throw the picture up, please. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5654.64s)]
*  And then they use all the software to actually create an extremely accurate 3D [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5656.0s)]
*  model of your heart. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5660.6s)]
*  And what they can do is go inside of your arteries and actually measure the [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5662.28s)]
*  calcium buildup. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5666.400000000001s)]
*  I've mentioned this before. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5667.12s)]
*  This is a service called Heart Flow, H E A R T F L O W. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5668.08s)]
*  In any event, my calcium score is still zero. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5676.24s)]
*  Thank God. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5678.4400000000005s)]
*  Touch wood. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5678.96s)]
*  Keep grinding. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5679.4800000000005s)]
*  But I just wanted to put this out there for anybody who has a history of heart [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5680.2s)]
*  disease in their family for them or for their parents or what have you. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5684.76s)]
*  If you go and ask your doctor, this is a third party service that they can do it. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5689.08s)]
*  You go get a contrast CT and you can get a very accurate sense of your heart [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5692.96s)]
*  health. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5698.32s)]
*  This is amazing. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5699.32s)]
*  They, they found it's incredible. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5700.24s)]
*  They found that you have a heart. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5702.36s)]
*  They did find that I have a heart. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5704.36s)]
*  This is, this is incredible. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5706.0s)]
*  They did find that I have a heart. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5707.639999999999s)]
*  This is, this is incredible technology. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5709.32s)]
*  Cause all of us, we would try to find if you had a heart for all this 112 [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5711.96s)]
*  episodes, Dr. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5716.04s)]
*  Carlsberg was shocked. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5717.28s)]
*  Breaking news. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5718.2s)]
*  They found a heart. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5719.24s)]
*  It looked huge. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5720.84s)]
*  It looked like secretariat. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5721.84s)]
*  It's like he's got a big heart. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5722.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5724.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5724.719999999999s)]
*  I, I do have a big heart boys. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5726.04s)]
*  As you guys know. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5727.639999999999s)]
*  No, I mean, this is shocking for the audience. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5728.639999999999s)]
*  Is that actual size? [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5730.96s)]
*  That can't be actual size. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5732.36s)]
*  His heart's bigger than his brain. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5733.88s)]
*  He's got a big heart. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5735.0s)]
*  Well, glad you're healthy bestie. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5736.56s)]
*  That's fantastic. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5738.84s)]
*  So go get, go get a heart flow. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5739.8s)]
*  If anybody has heart disease, go talk to your doctor. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5741.08s)]
*  All right. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5743.2s)]
*  Well for David sacks. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5743.6s)]
*  Was, was the moderation. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5745.64s)]
*  Okay. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5746.6s)]
*  Uh, yeah. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5747.04s)]
*  I mean, listen, it was interesting as if you were doing it, Jake, hell. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5748.72s)]
*  All right. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5751.92s)]
*  Fairness. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5752.280000000001s)]
*  I'll come back to moderate next week. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5753.12s)]
*  I'll moderate next week. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5754.4400000000005s)]
*  I'll be honest with you. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5755.12s)]
*  I would give both the David's a robotic B minus C plus. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5755.88s)]
*  I think they're better off opining than moderating. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5761.6s)]
*  Okay. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5765.72s)]
*  And I think that Jason really doesn't have anything interesting to say. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5766.96s)]
*  So he's better off moderating. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5769.84s)]
*  I don't know what he's like my comments last week. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5772.360000000001s)]
*  And then we can minimize the number of times he finds any random way to take it [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5774.6s)]
*  back to virtue signaling and genuflecting about China. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5779.4800000000005s)]
*  I was going to ask Jason what he thought about the Cowboys 49ers game where [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5782.64s)]
*  Kittle was an ineligible downfield receiver and they didn't call a penalty. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5788.5199999999995s)]
*  Very important catch for that game that again, the Cowboys now losing every [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5792.48s)]
*  single time they get to the playoffs. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5796.44s)]
*  But I didn't want to ask you cause I was, I thought that you would veer it [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5798.759999999999s)]
*  towards Xi Jinping and some China comment. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5801.679999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5806.0s)]
*  Any genuflecting would you like to do before you go back to your, [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5807.5199999999995s)]
*  I will admit that the moderation thing is harder than it looks. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5809.88s)]
*  Well, it's harder than it looks to be entertaining. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5814.759999999999s)]
*  I think that's, that's, that's the thing. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5817.12s)]
*  I think Jason does a good job. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5818.84s)]
*  I think Jake Alon A to A plus on is entertaining. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5819.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5823.08s)]
*  A plus. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5823.36s)]
*  A plus moderator. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5824.12s)]
*  Get back to your job, Jake Alon. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5825.08s)]
*  I will, I will come back next week and moderate. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5827.12s)]
*  I have been under the weather. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5829.2s)]
*  Pass the ball and let, and let us put the ball in the basket. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5831.68s)]
*  I will put the ball exactly where you each like it perfectly. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5834.68s)]
*  Look for some great assists coming next week with Jake Alon's back at 100% [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5838.6s)]
*  strength. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&t=5841.68s)]
