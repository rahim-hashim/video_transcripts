# E149 Hamas terror attacks in Israel fallout, reaction, next steps
**All In Podcast:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw)
*  All right, everybody. Welcome to episode 149 of the All In podcast with me again, David Sacks and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=0.0s)]
*  Chamath Palihapitiya. David Freeberg couldn't make it this week. We're going to carry on without him. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=7.84s)]
*  And it's a difficult week. So just a quick opening statement from me about this episode. Like all of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=12.4s)]
*  you were devastated by the terrorist attacks that occurred in Israel on Saturday. And I just want [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=17.84s)]
*  to start the discussion here with two important housekeeping notes. First, this is obviously a very [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=22.72s)]
*  dynamic situation. And we're dealing with the fog of war quite literally. So we're going to do our [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=28.4s)]
*  best to make sense of what's happening. But things will change between when we tape this episode on [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  Thursday, and you choose to listen to it in all likelihood at some point over the weekend. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=38.8s)]
*  Second, there are going to be some folks out there who claim quite correctly that we are not the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  experts on this topic and thus we shouldn't chime in with our opinions. On the other side, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=48.8s)]
*  the All In community has told me explicitly they want to hear us discuss what happened and they [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=54.16s)]
*  want a sense of normalcy. As one loyal listener explained to me last night at a dinner, the fact [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=59.04s)]
*  that the four of you can debate hard topics, listen to each other, and in the end have a deeper [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=64.32s)]
*  understanding of the world gives me hope every week. That's why I listen. So we'll do what we do [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=68.32s)]
*  here every week. We'll have the hard discussion. We'll listen to each other deeply, hopefully, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  and we'll try to understand the world and each other just a little bit more. And that's worth it, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=77.36s)]
*  at least to me and apparently many of you. So with those two quick disclaimers, gentlemen, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=82.56s)]
*  anything you want to say upfront before I recap where we are five days into this senseless [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=87.2s)]
*  brutality? I think that was a pretty good intro, Jason. I mean, you're right. We're taping on [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  Thursday, late morning Pacific time. By the time this drops, it'll be Friday. And so a lot could [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=99.04s)]
*  have happened. Also, it's true that the Middle East in general and this topic in particular [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=105.6s)]
*  is hugely complicated. We will be accused of not being experts, but at the same time, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=110.24s)]
*  the audience seems to appreciate our opinions as consumers of information who are trying to make [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=114.88s)]
*  sense of the world. Yeah. So that's all we can really do. Right. And conversations, I think, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  are how we make progress. Any thoughts before we get started here? And I'll recap what's occurred. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=126.24s)]
*  Chamath, any opening thoughts before we get into the details here? On behalf of somebody who [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=131.84s)]
*  worked in Israel, have a lot of friends there, spent a lot of time there. It's really just a [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=140.32000000000002s)]
*  terrible, devastating situation. I've really tried to stay off of social media just because [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=147.68s)]
*  it's allowed me to kind of think a little bit more logically. It's fast and furious right now, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=155.28s)]
*  I think on X. And it's just a lot of people trying to make sure that their version of the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=162.0s)]
*  truth is amplified over every other version of the truth, which I think is the point in the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=169.12s)]
*  cycle where you just have to almost unplug from the matrix a little bit and find a few places [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=173.52s)]
*  that seem to be just telling things in an even-handed way, which I also find on X. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=182.08s)]
*  And then just kind of reconstruct what happened, why it happened, what do we do from here? I don't [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=187.6s)]
*  know. I have a lot of thoughts on a lot of the peripheral issues, but the core issue is just, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=193.68s)]
*  I'm just stunned that this happened. I don't even know how this is possible that this happened. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=199.68s)]
*  Like Chamath, I'm not trying to get too weighed in too deeply into the tweets, but- [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=204.4s)]
*  I did notice you, by the way, have stopped tweeting. You've done a couple of retweets, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=210.4s)]
*  but you paused this week a lot of your tweeting. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=215.12s)]
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, I mean, I think that- [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=217.6s)]
*  Jason Bahl Your processing things, right? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  Pete Slauson â€¦it's an important time to listen and learn and process what's going on. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=221.68s)]
*  Jason Bahl Right. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=224.56s)]
*  Pete Slauson That's not a great time to be having hot takes. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=225.28s)]
*  I have posted a few things. First of all, Jason, you've made the analogy to 9-11 being in New York [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=228.0s)]
*  right now. I think that is the comparison that's been made is that this is Israel's 9-11. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=233.28s)]
*  Jason Bahl Yeah. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=237.6s)]
*  Pete Slauson I think that's a justifiable comparison in two respects. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=238.24s)]
*  One is this was a terrorist attack. It was an atrocity. This was a massacre of civilians. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=241.6s)]
*  Even if you're somebody who believes in the Palestinian cause, you should be able to recognize [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=248.96s)]
*  that these were war crimes. The videos are coming out, the stories are coming out. In particular, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=253.2s)]
*  the rounding up and slaughter of 260 attendees at a music festival was really beyond the pale. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=259.36s)]
*  They're clearing some of these farming villages and so forth and finding the bodies, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=266.88s)]
*  the families basically killed. Anyway, we don't need to repeat all of the details here. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  But this was, I think, an attack on civilians that is reminiscent of 9-11 and has affected the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=279.36s)]
*  Israeli people in a similar way. I think the other analogy to 9-11 that's worth discussing [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=288.48s)]
*  is the reaction to this or what Israel's going to do and what the reaction is by [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=294.56s)]
*  US political figures. You heard people like Nikki Haley basically saying to Netanyahu, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=299.36s)]
*  finish them. It wasn't exactly clear whether she was just talking about Hamas or the whole Gaza [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=307.92s)]
*  Strip or maybe Iran. And then if there was any ambiguity about that, you just had Lindsey Graham [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=313.28s)]
*  come out and say level the place, meaning referring to all of Gaza. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=318.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. I'm very concerned that one of the purposes here of the terrorists was to provoke [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=322.4s)]
*  an overreaction like the US engaged in after 9-11. Remember, we were viciously attacked, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=330.56s)]
*  we were wounded. We then lashed out and plunged into two decades of wars in the Middle East. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=337.76s)]
*  What was the result of that? We lost thousands of lives or our own soldiers. We spent trillions [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=343.59999999999997s)]
*  of our treasure. Millions of people on the other side died. At the end of the day, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=348.32s)]
*  we only changed the geopolitical map of the Middle East in ways that were ultimately [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=354.56s)]
*  unfavorable for us. Iran became a more powerful country. The region became destabilized. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=358.4s)]
*  We squandered the sympathy that the United States had and its moral position that we had after 9-11 [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=365.12s)]
*  in the eyes of much of the world. So the US, I think, fell for the trap that I think Bin Laden [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=371.2s)]
*  laid, which was to provoke us into an overreaction. I think that is one of the goals of terrorists, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=378.08s)]
*  is to create such an outrage, such a provocation that they will bait the other side into an [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=382.56s)]
*  overreaction. I'm quite concerned that could happen here. I think that our US leaders should be, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=387.36s)]
*  as friends of Israel, should be counseling a cool-headed response. I think braying for [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=394.24s)]
*  war with Iran or suggesting that the entire Gaza Strip should be leveled would be doing [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  exactly the wrong thing. It would ignite the Arab street throughout the Middle East. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  And to your point, perhaps that was the goal here. We're trying to figure out what is the goal of [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=412.4s)]
*  this attack that was planned for years. And perhaps that was the goal, is to try to take [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  all the hard-fought peace and progress that has been made in that process over the last couple [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=422.24s)]
*  years, Abraham Accords, and stability, and then just really create a full-scale escalation. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=427.6s)]
*  Pete Slauson I think that's right. I mean, look, I think [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  Israel is within its rights to dismantle and destroy Hamas. Hamas is an organization that, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=437.68s)]
*  in its charter, has said they're committed to the destruction of Israel. They've now [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=443.04s)]
*  committed this atrocity. Again, it was, if they had just limited their attack on [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=448.24s)]
*  uniformed Israeli officers and military, I think that would be one thing, but they went much [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=453.44s)]
*  further than that. The vast majority of the casualties here are civilians who were [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=458.32s)]
*  murdered in atrocious ways. So, I think there are terrorist organizations in Israel as well within [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=463.6s)]
*  its rights to destroy them. However, the question is how you do that? Like a lot of terrorist [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=468.32s)]
*  organizations, Hamas can kind of melt away into the population of Gaza. They apparently have [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=474.56s)]
*  these elaborate tunnel networks. They've got bunkers. So, it's not clear that you can destroy [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=480.32s)]
*  them from the sky through bombing. Those kinds of bombs would lead to a lot of civilian casualties, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=485.76s)]
*  which will inflame the situation and turn a world opinion against Israel. At the same time, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=493.12s)]
*  if they go in with ground forces, that seems like a really tough situation as well because [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=499.28s)]
*  Hamas is waiting for them and they'll have to fight a guerrilla war in a very tightly packed, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=504.96s)]
*  dense urban area where Hamas likely has anti-tank weapons, weapons that we've seen that have been [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=510.47999999999996s)]
*  so effective against armored vehicles in Ukraine. Again, if the fighting gets too hot, they can [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=516.4s)]
*  disappear into these tunnel networks. There's going to be IEDs everywhere. It's going to be a [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=522.8s)]
*  very, very tough fight for the Israelis. So, I think they're in an incredibly tough spot. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=526.88s)]
*  I'm not quite sure what the right reaction is for them, but I do think that if the reaction [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=533.2800000000001s)]
*  is this, let's call it the Lindsey Graham level the place reaction, I think that could set off [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=541.2s)]
*  a much wider regional war or even a world war. And that is not something that's ultimately going [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=547.5200000000001s)]
*  to help Israel. And I hope that our leaders are wise enough to be counseling against that. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=552.72s)]
*  I get the sense that they're not going to go that hard. And if you look at the American response [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=557.6s)]
*  to 9-11, going into Afghanistan and dismantling Al-Qaeda, a noble mission, and we didn't have any [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=562.88s)]
*  more terrorist attacks on America. We thwarted most terrorist attacks. There were attempts, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=569.04s)]
*  actually. And our intelligence was very strong over the last couple of decades and we haven't had [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=573.84s)]
*  another one of those. But you're right, going into Iraq. And then, what was the last decade about [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=579.68s)]
*  being in Afghanistan? We went into Iraq, we went into Syria, we went into Libya. We stayed in [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=584.64s)]
*  Afghanistan for 20 years. It should have been a quick surgical strike to take out Al-Qaeda and [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=589.04s)]
*  their Taliban hosts and then we should have gotten out. And even that is incredibly difficult as a [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=594.08s)]
*  mission. As you're pointing out here, Hamas can just fade away into the Gaza Strip and into [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=599.04s)]
*  Palestine and who knows. Shema, I guess where we're at right now is trying to make sense of why this [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=605.12s)]
*  happened and what the next couple of weeks might look like. And so, your thoughts? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=611.92s)]
*  I think Israel has every right to defend itself and they should eradicate Hamas. This is not like we [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=618.88s)]
*  woke up and found out that they were a terrorist organization yesterday or on Sunday. We've known [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=626.3199999999999s)]
*  this for years. They've been labeled as such. People have been monitoring their money flows [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=631.8399999999999s)]
*  for years. We know where they were funded. But the thing to keep in mind is that those 30,000 Hamas [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=636.8s)]
*  terrorists have also been keeping 2.2 Palestinians hostage for the last 20 years. And of the 2.2 [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=643.1999999999999s)]
*  million Palestinians in Gaza, half are kids. And so, David's right. The thing to keep in mind is, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=652.4s)]
*  as barbaric as what happened to the Israelis were, Israel in its actions could cause tremendous [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=660.16s)]
*  civilian casualties, which will just further inflame the ability to find a long-term peace [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=670.88s)]
*  in the Middle East. That's really tragic and that's probably part of Hamas' sadistic calculus, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=676.16s)]
*  which is they probably expected this kind of a reaction and they probably don't care at the end [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=683.12s)]
*  of the day. So it's important to separate Palestinians from Hamas, but I understand and I [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=689.6s)]
*  know where Israel's coming from because we faced the same reaction after 9-11. The question that [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=698.0s)]
*  I have is, Israel is the most sophisticated military and intelligence organization in the world. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=704.0s)]
*  And the reason is because when everybody talks about priorities, Israel only really has one [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=713.68s)]
*  priority, which is to safeguard the Israeli people. And they've been essentially in a conflict zone [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=720.08s)]
*  with this sort of Damocles since the founding of Israel. So there are three organizations that [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=728.8s)]
*  really have to figure out what happened here. There's Mossad, which is the foreign intelligence [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=738.48s)]
*  service of Israel. There's Shin Bet, which is the domestic security apparatus. And there's Amman, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=744.8000000000001s)]
*  which is the military intelligence group. And it's like, how did this happen? Because this should [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=750.4s)]
*  have been priority one, two, three, and four. And it has always been for them. Other countries, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=756.32s)]
*  the safeguarding of their people is not necessarily always number one. And then things happen and [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=762.72s)]
*  then you reprioritize. In many ways, that's what happened in 9-11, I guess, at some level in America. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=767.76s)]
*  Aaron Powell Yeah. I mean, we had all the signal before that. And when we did the 9-11 commission [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=772.72s)]
*  and we found out they were going to flight school here, and it was pretty clear that it was an [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=777.44s)]
*  intelligence failure for America. Yeah. Aaron Powell Those are the two big thoughts that I have, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=784.08s)]
*  which is there's just going to be so many civilian casualties. What will that do to actually... [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=788.0s)]
*  I think that that has a huge negative impact on the long-term chances of peace because then [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=792.8s)]
*  radicals will use that information to further or to attempt to radicalize the next generation [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=798.8s)]
*  of Palestinians or other Arabs or whatever. And so I worry that [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=804.8s)]
*  the progress that was made in the Abraham Accords, all the normalization [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=809.44s)]
*  goes off the rails. And that's tragic because most of these people, the overwhelming majority of all [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=814.96s)]
*  people everywhere, they just want peace. They just want to live a decent life, take care of their [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=820.88s)]
*  family, raise their kids. So that's really tragic. But then the other part of my mind is like, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=825.92s)]
*  how could this have fallen through the cracks? And why were the most sophisticated intelligence [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=832.16s)]
*  organizations caught flat-footed here? Yeah. There's going to be a lot of information that [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=839.12s)]
*  will come out over time and lessons. And by the way, the reason why that second piece is important [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=846.08s)]
*  is not to point the finger at anybody, but it's to de-escalate because of what Sax said earlier, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=851.36s)]
*  which is that when people who can articulately gird for war are given the bully pulpit, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=856.08s)]
*  and you see American politicians now braying and girding for war, I don't think they fully recognize [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=862.48s)]
*  the consequences of that. They're not doing a full accounting of what America has lived through in [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=869.6s)]
*  the last quarter century. And now to induce other countries to try to do the same, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=873.92s)]
*  I think is so dangerous. And so if we can understand where these cracks are, at least we [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=881.4399999999999s)]
*  can de-escalate those specific individuals' attempts to escalate. And if we don't do that, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=886.9599999999999s)]
*  we're going to find ourselves in a really complicated war. And I don't think anybody [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=892.88s)]
*  wants that. Nobody wins. Nobody wins. Yeah. I mean, at this point, really, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=899.76s)]
*  the returning of the hostages seems to be the most important high-order mission that has to occur. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=904.88s)]
*  After that, clearly dismantling Hamas and this terror apparatus. But having started to spend [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=912.16s)]
*  some time in the region and talking to people over there, and again, I'm no expert, but I have been [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=919.84s)]
*  talking to people who've been working on this. People have been working on trying to create peace [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=925.76s)]
*  in the region for their entire lives. And this is definitely a setback, but I'm an optimist. And I [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=930.16s)]
*  actually think that in some ways, this is going to create a climate where people are going to really [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=936.08s)]
*  fight to try to resolve this situation, or at least contain the situation. Two-State Solution, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=941.92s)]
*  the Abraham Accords. And I think this is going to renew people's commitment to peace in the region. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=948.56s)]
*  And I know many, many of the countries over there are really aghast at what happened, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=954.96s)]
*  and they've been working really hard to try to normalize relations there and create peace [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=960.64s)]
*  and prosperity and commerce between the different countries in the region. So this is just [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=964.5600000000001s)]
*  heartbreaking for the loss of human life and how that occurred. And then it's also heartbreaking [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=972.0s)]
*  for the peace process and all this progress that's been made recently. And so I think [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=977.0400000000001s)]
*  that there's no silver lining here, but I do think this will maybe, the good people of the [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=982.8s)]
*  world will recommit to trying to resolve this issue and create peace in the region. That's my hope. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=989.52s)]
*  I know it's simplistic, and again, no expert, but that's my hope. And I've been spending time [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=996.5600000000001s)]
*  over there and learning a lot more about the region. These are multi-generational issues [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1002.32s)]
*  that are going to take generations to figure out. And it's two steps forward, one step back, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1006.88s)]
*  obviously. But man, for the politicians and the people negotiating this peace, and they work so [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1012.08s)]
*  tirelessly on this for their whole lives, keep at it. That's all we can do, right? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1018.56s)]
*  Pete Slauson I mean, Jason, I think disrupting the process that was happening towards normalization [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1025.76s)]
*  of relations between Israel and Arab states, specifically the Gulf monarchies, I think was [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1030.4s)]
*  one of the objectives here. So, I mean, Israel's contention for a long time is they want to negotiate [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1035.92s)]
*  peace, they want to negotiate, but they don't have a partner to negotiate with. Whether you believe [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1041.04s)]
*  that or not, that was their position. And with the Abraham Accords, we saw that they started to [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1046.5600000000002s)]
*  be able to negotiate, again, normalization with three Gulf Arab states without involving the [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1053.1200000000001s)]
*  Palestinians. And it looked like that issue was being put to one side and that they were kind of [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1062.56s)]
*  going around it. And the idea being, look, if you won't negotiate with us, then we'll figure out a [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1068.24s)]
*  way to move forward without you. The big news that's been going on in the last few months is that [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1073.04s)]
*  supposedly Israel and Saudi Arabia were close to working out some sort of normalization. And I think [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1078.0s)]
*  that process has been put on hold until I think this has been dealt with. And so, I think one of [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1086.08s)]
*  the takeaways here is the idea that you're going to be able to get to Middle East peace without [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1092.16s)]
*  resolving this Palestinian question. I think this is basically a return to the reality that [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1097.3600000000001s)]
*  that issue is simply going to have to be dealt with. I don't think we're going to get to a larger [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1103.8400000000001s)]
*  deal in the Middle East. We're not going to resolve all these problems until this long [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1109.0400000000002s)]
*  festering problem of the treatment of the Palestinians is dealt with. I think you're right [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1114.16s)]
*  that the two-state solution is the only possible solution that makes sense. I mean, what's the [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1119.84s)]
*  alternative? A one-state solution means that either it's run by the Israelis, but presiding over [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1128.32s)]
*  hostile Palestinian minority that may eventually one day be the majority and you're forced into [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1139.28s)]
*  some sort of apartheid state, or the Palestinians are running that one-party state and it means [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1144.8s)]
*  that the Jews have been pushed into the sea. So, neither one of those solutions looks very good. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1150.32s)]
*  So, that leaves you with a two-state solution, however hard, however impossible it seems [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1155.76s)]
*  to negotiate that. It's the only option. Yeah, it's the only option. And it's a real opportunity. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1161.12s)]
*  I think my hope is that instead of pushing Saudi away, this actually pulls Saudi closer and says, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1166.96s)]
*  okay, this is a chance to really normalize the global perception of the Middle East. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1174.72s)]
*  Because if there can be a way for Israel and Saudi to build a bridge here, I have a lot of hope that [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1180.88s)]
*  there can be a lot of stability and a lot of the good work. I mean, again, like, man, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1186.0s)]
*  as a Democrat who has been left homeless, who is now definitely in the center, but probably leaning [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1193.2s)]
*  increasingly right, I'm left yet again with an appreciation, despite the messenger of the message [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1201.84s)]
*  of the Trump administration, because what those guys did was pretty incredible in hindsight. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1208.6399999999999s)]
*  These Abraham Accords, the Accords with Israel and the GCC, the almost accord between Israel and Saudi. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1215.28s)]
*  To really be able to like find a long-lasting peace is just a real example for the world. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1224.0s)]
*  And those guys did a lot of really good work. And it's a miracle actually, when you look at it, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1231.84s)]
*  what they did, you know, despite the fact, listen, I'm no fan of Trump, and I am too homeless. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1238.24s)]
*  But this is where, but if you want to objectively look at what they did, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1243.52s)]
*  that was good work. It was great work. You have to. And in fact, this is a moment where you have to [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1247.4399999999998s)]
*  start to re underwrite, like, is your, not you, Jason, but I'm just saying collectively, is one's [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1252.24s)]
*  Trump derangement syndrome causing more damage than anything that Trump could have actually done? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1258.4s)]
*  And I think the answer is yes, because like, it's now causing us to not see [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1264.24s)]
*  that good work and then embrace and extend it. So much of the work that happened in that [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1270.48s)]
*  administration turns out to have been right. And that's what's so frustrating for me, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1275.2800000000002s)]
*  the work on the border wall, we didn't like the messenger. So we killed the message, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1282.5600000000002s)]
*  turned out it was right. Issuing long term debt to refinance when rates were at zero, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1287.12s)]
*  we didn't like the messenger. So we killed the message. A structural piece in the Middle East, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1292.0s)]
*  we didn't like the messenger. So we killed the message. When are we going to stop shooting [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1297.84s)]
*  ourselves in the foot? And when are we going to actually see and take the time to look past [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1302.4799999999998s)]
*  who was saying things and actually listen to them word for word? I'll give you an example. I [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1308.1599999999999s)]
*  started to tweet three links a day over the past three days. And the only reason I did that was I [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1313.2s)]
*  thought things were so hyper contentious and hyper partisan that I just wanted to show a few sides, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1320.56s)]
*  right? And one day I found a couple links, two of which one was from Jonathan Greenblatt of the ADL, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1326.64s)]
*  who I thought had a very powerful message. And one was from Mike Flynn. And his message was also [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1334.0800000000002s)]
*  pretty powerful if you just read it. And if you took the names off, all the content was so valuable, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1342.16s)]
*  both points of view. But the minute it goes into the world, people immediately judge and they [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1348.56s)]
*  kill the message because of the messenger. And this is exactly a moment where you have an [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1353.6s)]
*  opportunity to just stop doing that because the stakes are so high. It's infuriating, actually, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1358.8799999999999s)]
*  quite honestly. It's infuriating to see it. We had this last week on the show when we were talking [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1363.92s)]
*  about reducing spending. Matt Gaetz is not the perfect messenger, but his message was the message [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1367.84s)]
*  we've been talking about, which is, hey, we have to control spending. So I can understand people [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1372.8s)]
*  not liking Matt Gaetz. There's a lot of things to not like about him. I can understand people [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1377.52s)]
*  not liking Trump. And get over it. Well, and then, you know, it's bizarre that his son-in-law went [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1381.76s)]
*  to do all this work, but yet he did it and it had success. That's another example. It's weird. If [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1388.1599999999999s)]
*  you send your son-in-law to do it, but I listened to the Lex Friedman podcast. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1395.2s)]
*  You know what? It's not weird because at the end, if you listen to this podcast, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1398.48s)]
*  the most important thing that is resoundingly obvious about Jared Kushner is that he is [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1402.0s)]
*  incredibly thoughtful and incredibly competent. And why did we have to spend years being fed all of [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1409.44s)]
*  these stupid lies? Because one can judge for oneself, but Jared Kushner is thoughtful. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1418.96s)]
*  He's smart. And I thought to myself, I was fed all these lies for years about how this guy was like [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1426.32s)]
*  moping around in the shadows and this and that, and it was all not true. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1432.32s)]
*  Well, no, when I say it's non-traditional, if you sent, you know, any president's son-in-law, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1436.56s)]
*  daughter-in-law, whatever child to go to the Middle East on its surface, this seems insane. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1443.68s)]
*  But in fact, they did good work. And so it's not traditional. It's not what you would expect. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1450.64s)]
*  Thoughtful and competent. That's what I thought after I, that's what I got out of it as well. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1456.8s)]
*  Is that he's thoughtful and competent. Yeah. Yeah. He brought some fresh ideas. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1460.5600000000002s)]
*  Just so the audience is clear, what we're talking about is he just did an interview with Lex Friedman [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1463.28s)]
*  and the first hour was on what's happening with Israel and Hamas. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1467.28s)]
*  Must watch, I think. I thought it was excellent, too. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1471.44s)]
*  Excellent. Excellent. It was excellent. He did, just in terms of having fresh eyes, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1474.24s)]
*  he did things like focus groups. He's like, okay, what does the Arab street think about [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1478.88s)]
*  various topics? And he actually did focus groups in various countries to find out. So, I mean, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1484.3200000000002s)]
*  I think Kushner made a number of really interesting points showing how difficult it's going to be to [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1489.1200000000001s)]
*  get to a two-state solution. But first, you have to set up what does the Palestinian side say? And [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1492.72s)]
*  what they say is, look, Gaza is effectively an open-air prison. You've got over 2 million people [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1498.16s)]
*  packed into this very tight area. There's something like 50% unemployment. It's impoverished. The [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1503.3600000000001s)]
*  conditions are deplorable and they don't have their own state. They don't have rights. And [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1509.76s)]
*  it's been like this for a long time. So, that's sort of the basic pro-Palestinian argument. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1514.0800000000002s)]
*  Kushner's response to that was, well, yeah, but Israel left in 2006. It left Hamas in control, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1520.64s)]
*  gave them the keys effectively. The reason why there's such high unemployment is because [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1526.64s)]
*  Hamas is corrupt and doesn't enforce property rights. And they scare away all the investment. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1532.5600000000002s)]
*  Nobody wants to invest there. And Israel did give work permits so people could leave Gaza to go to [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1537.2800000000002s)]
*  work. And look what happened. I mean, when they try to open up the walls, you have a massacre. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1542.48s)]
*  So, these are the points that he made. Look, I think both sides of this have legitimate arguments [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1549.2s)]
*  and points to make. I think that the conditions of the Palestinians in Gaza is deplorable and [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1554.32s)]
*  you have to feel for the civilians who live there. But then, the Israelis have a right to live without [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1560.8799999999999s)]
*  fear, the fear that their security is in jeopardy and that this territory can be the launching pad [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1569.76s)]
*  for terrorist attacks on their soil. So, it's going to be an extremely difficult thing, I think, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1574.72s)]
*  to reconcile this. But Kushner made a couple of other interesting points. He said, listen, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1580.1599999999999s)]
*  the Gaza part of this is not that hard because the boundaries, the territory lines are not in [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1584.0s)]
*  dispute. There's no religious areas that are in dispute. For example, you don't have the status [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1589.36s)]
*  of the Temple Mount or East Jerusalem. And there's an economic plan to revitalize [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1594.16s)]
*  Gaza Strip. So, you really just need a negotiating partner for the Israelis to figure that out. And, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1598.96s)]
*  of course, now the problem is, who do you negotiate with? I mean, Hamas is a terrorist [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1605.68s)]
*  organization that is dedicated to the destruction of Israel. So, it's really a tragic situation. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1610.4s)]
*  You look at it and you're like, this should be easy to work out, but it's not. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1617.3600000000001s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell It's a relatively small area. It's a relatively small number of people. It's [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1621.6000000000001s)]
*  two million people. We should be able to figure out the rest of the free world, how to at least [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1626.48s)]
*  have a path towards this. And the first step is getting rid of Hamas, right? There's no choice, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1631.44s)]
*  but they have to go. And then you have to figure out who to... [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1635.2800000000002s)]
*  I mean, look, if there was a button that Israel could push to eliminate every member of Hamas, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1638.8s)]
*  yeah, sure, they'd be within their rights to push that. The problem is that Hamas is now [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1645.92s)]
*  deeply embedded in a civilian population over over two million that's densely packed. How do [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1651.84s)]
*  you root them out? Aaron Ross Powell [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1659.2s)]
*  It's going to take decades. It's going to take decades. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1660.24s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell And they're basically [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1662.0s)]
*  supported by that population as far as we can tell. And again, if you take measures that are [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1663.52s)]
*  perceived as too drastic by the rest of the world, then you will inflame the opinion of other [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1670.56s)]
*  countries, you'll turn it against Israel. So again, it's a really tough situation, but I think that [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1676.24s)]
*  the US should not only affirm its support for Israel, it should not only denounce the atrocity [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1683.92s)]
*  that happened on 10-7, but I think it needs to reiterate the Biden administration does its [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1689.76s)]
*  support for a two-state solution. I think that the US has to be on record that what's in everybody's [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1695.12s)]
*  long-term interests, including Israel, is ultimately a two-state solution. And the Palestinians are [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1701.52s)]
*  eventually going to have to have their own state. There's simply no way around that. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1706.4s)]
*  Right. Yeah. And the free world, I think, is in the process of getting engaged in making this [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1710.4s)]
*  happen because it's in everybody's interests. This can't keep going on. And so hopefully this, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1719.52s)]
*  again, I don't want to say silver lining, but I hope that this, the good that comes out of this [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1723.76s)]
*  is that the world focuses on resolving this conflict or continuing it. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1728.48s)]
*  Will you surprise at all, Jason, by the amount of people that seem to be almost justifying? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1731.68s)]
*  That was shocking to me. I mean, the fact that people could make any kind of equivalence between [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1739.04s)]
*  terrorist activity and the level of brutality, I can't even describe it because it'll trigger [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1744.72s)]
*  my PTSD, which I had after 9-11, and it still affects me. I'm sitting here not far from [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1749.76s)]
*  ground zero. And, you know, for people, educated people on college campuses or just otherwise to [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1756.64s)]
*  blame the Israelis for the murder of children, for people being, and then justifying rape and [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1766.32s)]
*  torture and kidnapping. I mean, there is no justification and there is no equivalency. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1774.8799999999999s)]
*  There's no equivalency here. And this is one of the big problems. And, you know, these dopey kids [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1779.36s)]
*  on Harvard's campus or whatever, they have never experienced evil, or suffering. We can literally [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1783.9199999999998s)]
*  just dismiss these idiots because these are kids who have never faced evil. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1791.76s)]
*  But, Jason, I don't think you can. I think one of the things that was shocking to me was the level of [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1796.8s)]
*  basically either subtle or latent anti-Semitism. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1803.52s)]
*  Unconscious, yeah, subtle, whatever. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1807.52s)]
*  That it unlocked. And I was also shocked that just, Sax says he used this word before, but it's true, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1809.92s)]
*  but our leading educational institutions have really become woke madrasas. They are inculcating [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1816.72s)]
*  kids with just some virulent poison. I think the reaction is always to go after, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1824.0s)]
*  to support the underdog, I think, in this group of people. That is an idiotic simplification that [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1828.72s)]
*  the smartest schools in the world, educating the smartest kids in the world, should be capable of [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1835.76s)]
*  seeing power. That's how they think though. It can't be that simple. This is not my feeling. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1840.24s)]
*  I think that it's half anti-Semitism, it's half they just think, who's the underdog? I'm taking [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1844.0s)]
*  that side. I do think it's that simple. In the woke mindset, yeah. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1849.36s)]
*  Pete Slauson Well, look, I think it was disgusting and disturbing to see [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1854.08s)]
*  these organizations and these elite institutions being unable to denounce Hamas' terrorist attack [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1858.96s)]
*  and the atrocity that took place, or turning out in the streets to celebrate what happened. And we [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1865.92s)]
*  saw a lot of that too. Look, even if you support the Palestinian cause, even if you believe that [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1871.36s)]
*  they've been mistreated, even if you think that their land has been occupied, they deserve their [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1877.9199999999998s)]
*  own state, even if you believe that war against the state of Israel is justified on that basis, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1882.8799999999999s)]
*  these were still war crimes. These were beyond the pale of war. Again, Hamas did not just attack [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1890.9599999999998s)]
*  some military installations on the border and kill soldiers or capture soldiers. The vast majority [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1898.8s)]
*  of the people who were killed were civilians and there was no conceivable military purpose. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1905.44s)]
*  And for example, paragliding into a music festival, a festival for peace by the way, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1911.28s)]
*  and then rounding up and slaughtering the concert goers. There was no conceivable military [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1916.6399999999999s)]
*  justification for going into these kibbutz's or farming communities, you know, massacring families. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1920.72s)]
*  No, it's deranged. It's deranged. So, it's terrorism. And the fact that they can't frame [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1927.4399999999998s)]
*  it as terrorism is insane. But think about what happened, okay? I just want to frame the order [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1933.4399999999998s)]
*  of events, okay? 10-7 happens. And I think within 36 hours or less, let's take Harvard as an example, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1937.36s)]
*  okay? The pinnacle of the Woc madrasas. They had all these student organizations immediately come [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1945.9199999999998s)]
*  out trying to justify this thing without any information, right? Because in the first 36 hours, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1952.32s)]
*  obviously not nearly as much information was available as to exactly what happened [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1958.1599999999999s)]
*  than has been available now as an example. I should read the statement just so people [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1962.96s)]
*  have clarity here. Please. Joint statement by Harvard, Palestine, solidarity groups on [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1966.6399999999999s)]
*  the situation in Palestine. We, the undersigned student organizations, hold the Israeli regime [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1972.24s)]
*  entirely responsible for all unfolding violence. Today's events did not occur in a vacuum. The [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1979.6s)]
*  last two decades, millions of Palestinians in Gaza have been forced to live in an open air prison. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1985.36s)]
*  Israeli officials promised to, quote, open the gates of hell and the massacres in Gaza have [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1990.3999999999999s)]
*  already commenced. Palestinians in Gaza have no shelters or for refuge and nowhere to escape. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=1995.52s)]
*  In the coming days, Palestinians will be forced to bear the full brunt of Israel's violence. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2002.3999999999999s)]
*  This is deranged and sociopathic. My point is you have like 15 or 20 of these student organizations [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2008.08s)]
*  of all ilks, okay? So it's not just pro-Palestinian groups. It was like the Harvard Sikhs Association, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2014.32s)]
*  okay? Like Sikhs in South Asia are the most peace-loving people in the world. They're not [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2021.28s)]
*  pro-war of any kind whatsoever or pro-terrorism. So all these people write this thing which blames [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2025.4399999999998s)]
*  Israel. Okay. Then the school is totally silent. The school doesn't say anything. They neither [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2032.56s)]
*  completely disavow that statement nor do they come out with a more reasonable statement. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2040.48s)]
*  All these ex-faculty and ex-individuals, Larry Summers sort of leading, say this is outrageous, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2046.24s)]
*  have an opinion. They come out with something that's milk toast in the middle of the road. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2052.48s)]
*  Then they get soundly rejected by everybody yet again. Then the administration comes out and gives [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2056.72s)]
*  a clean-dubbed version that tries to allay everybody's anger because that the first statement, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2061.68s)]
*  I think basically essentially pissed off everybody on both sides. Then a bunch of alums who've [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2066.64s)]
*  already graduated or who've given money say these student organizations are outrageous. We will not [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2072.24s)]
*  hire anybody who's part of this because their views are so immoral that we would never want these [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2077.68s)]
*  people part of our organization. And so here it is, Phil Ackman, just so we people have this [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2085.68s)]
*  Bill Ackman said, I have been asked by a number of CEOs if Harvard would release a list of the [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2091.6s)]
*  members of each of the Harvard organizations that have issued the letter of signing sole [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2096.4s)]
*  responsibly for Amasa's heinous acts to Israel so as to ensure that none of us inadvertently hire [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2099.68s)]
*  any of their members. In other words, you must own your words, which is an important lesson for- [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2105.8399999999997s)]
*  So then what happens is individual students actually have to come out who are part of [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2110.3199999999997s)]
*  these associations that were signatories to the first release, had to disavow the statement [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2117.2s)]
*  and said, actually, I'm just an Indian student at Harvard Law School. Nick, maybe you can find this [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2122.72s)]
*  tweet of this Indian woman from Colorado of Indian heritage. And she's like, you just get [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2128.08s)]
*  auto-recruited into these organizations when you join Harvard. So I'm like, well, wait a minute, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2132.88s)]
*  this is a place that's supposed to be for modern free speech, progressive thinking. And instead, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2140.0s)]
*  what happens is based on your skin color, you get auto-drafted into some association, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2144.72s)]
*  then you auto-sign any press release written by some person that you don't even see or approve. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2148.9599999999996s)]
*  What is going on at these places? And these are the places that parents and kids are tripping over [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2154.72s)]
*  themselves trying to get into. Kids will kill themselves if they don't get into. And these are [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2160.0s)]
*  the worst institutions in America because back to Jason, what we talked about earlier, which is [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2165.3599999999997s)]
*  we need people who can think from first principles. Those kids are not it, and those [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2171.28s)]
*  institutions are not making them. And so if we want to have a point in time where when things [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2175.1200000000003s)]
*  like this happen, we can really figure out what happened in the past that was right and what can [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2180.0s)]
*  we do in the future, it's not this. And it's not this kind of thinking. And if you're going to a [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2184.96s)]
*  school, Harvard, Cornell, UPenn, Stanford, that are spitting out these kids, I think it's a real shame. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2190.7200000000003s)]
*  You're spot on. I mean, how, Sachs, could there be any question about the difference between [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2198.88s)]
*  military terrorists, you know, with machine guns, gunning down people, dancing peacefully at a music [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2205.44s)]
*  festival at sunrise, and then make some equivalency there, and you cannot actually ascertain for [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2213.52s)]
*  yourself that is a terrorist act. If you can't from very basically opening your eyes and seeing [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2221.6800000000003s)]
*  what occurred, and you know, thank God in some ways for for X not being censored, because you [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2227.6s)]
*  can actually see these things. And I know it's very difficult for people to watch. I don't [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2232.7999999999997s)]
*  have any judgment on people who don't want to watch it. But I think when the world sees [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2236.4s)]
*  these videos, and you're going to write this letter, you should very quickly be able to discern [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2240.48s)]
*  military terrorist fighters from hippie kids dancing at a music festival. It's plain as day, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2246.3199999999997s)]
*  there's nothing to confuse you here. This is the most easy test. You have to be brainwashed to see [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2256.16s)]
*  something other than that. These schools are woke madrasas. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2264.64s)]
*  Yeah, so a couple of points on that. So if you look at their statement, I think it's appropriate [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2267.92s)]
*  and fine to express concern about the people, the civilians living in Gaza, and what the Israeli [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2273.68s)]
*  response might entail. I think it is fine and good to do that both for humanitarian reasons and [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2279.76s)]
*  for self interested reasons if you're a supporter of Israel, because this could all spiral out of [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2288.0800000000004s)]
*  control. However, these people completely lit their credibility on fire from the first paragraph [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2292.1600000000003s)]
*  by saying that Israel is entirely responsible for what happened and not having one word of condemnation [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2299.2000000000003s)]
*  for the atrocities that had just been committed. They cannot even see the war crimes that have [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2306.48s)]
*  occurred. They don't even mention Hamas. They don't even mention the actual people that [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2312.4s)]
*  perpetrated the crime. Right. So the question is what is it about their ideology that blinds them [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2317.36s)]
*  to this atrocious massacre? And I think it is this, I do think it has to do with this woke mindset. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2325.04s)]
*  The woke ideology is a form of cultural Marxism in which people are divided up into oppressor [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2332.48s)]
*  and oppressed groups. So in Marx's original teaching, you had the proletariat and the [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2340.32s)]
*  bourgeoisie, basically the oppressed and the oppressor. This kind of went through this [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2344.8s)]
*  cultural identity filter with woke where, again, people are divided up into identity groups. And [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2350.48s)]
*  so you've got men versus women, white versus black and brown, you've got straight versus gay, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2355.44s)]
*  and so on down the line. And the idea is that there's a power structure. And if you are in [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2362.08s)]
*  one of these groups, then you are by definition oppressed. And if you are in one of the oppressor [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2370.4s)]
*  groups, then by definition, you are guilty in a collective way. You're suffering from collective [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2375.52s)]
*  faults. The people who are oppressed are the righteous ones. Right. But I think that [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2382.8s)]
*  what you see is that when you divide up the world this way, first of all, this is not a very accurate [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2389.36s)]
*  way of looking at the world. I mean, there are lots of minority groups in the United States that [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2394.48s)]
*  have done great. So for example, there's a book written recently about Asian Americans in the [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2398.5600000000004s)]
*  United States called The Inconvenient Minority. Why is it inconvenient? Because Asian Americans [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2403.76s)]
*  have done spectacularly well. They get into elite colleges and institutions at higher rates [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2409.12s)]
*  than whites do, which is why they're the primary group that's discriminated against by [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2414.64s)]
*  affirmative action before it was overturned by the Supreme Court. But the reason why the author [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2419.6s)]
*  called them the inconvenient minority is because their success in America refutes a lot of this [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2423.8399999999997s)]
*  sort of simplistic, woke delineation between if you're a minority group, you're oppressed. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2429.7599999999998s)]
*  And if you're in this white group, you're the oppressor. I think Jews have fallen into [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2434.48s)]
*  a similar type of categorization, which is they're an inconvenient minority. They've been [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2441.04s)]
*  historically very successful in America despite there being existence of anti-Semitism. And I [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2446.32s)]
*  think that the woke ideology has reacted to this by saying, no, Jews are not really an ethnic group. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2452.8s)]
*  They're just whites. And so that's been the response, right, is, well, let's just put them [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2459.36s)]
*  in the oppressor group. So we don't need to explain away their success. One of the problems [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2463.44s)]
*  with that is that you have to ignore the existence of anti-Semitism. And so they do. They just pretend [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2467.92s)]
*  like it doesn't exist. So here you have a situation where all of these things are in play. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2473.6s)]
*  They've already predefined the Palestinians as being an oppressed people. And look, and I think [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2479.04s)]
*  in many ways they are, but they- They are. Not incorrect. Yeah, not incorrect. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2484.8s)]
*  But they've defined it in racial terms, really. And they've defined the Israelis and Jews really [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2488.24s)]
*  more generally as being part of an oppressor group. And so everything fits into that larger [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2494.9599999999996s)]
*  narrative. And so when members of one of these woke oppressed groups commits an injustice, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2499.8399999999997s)]
*  they just can't see it. I mean, their version of social justice is always defined in terms [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2507.9199999999996s)]
*  of collective guilt. And if you're a member of an oppressed group, by definition, you're not [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2513.52s)]
*  capable of committing an injustice because you don't have the power. Do you guys think that [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2518.16s)]
*  Bill Ackman was out of line by saying, I don't want to hire kids from these organizations and [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2522.48s)]
*  these schools because it's just like these kids and these schools will bring, basically, I think [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2529.68s)]
*  what he's implicitly saying is distraction and it will lower the probability that I achieve by [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2534.32s)]
*  corporate goals. So these are not good workers. Based on your comment about thinking from first [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2539.76s)]
*  principles and being able to assess the situation, I think that's probably what happens at a hedge [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2545.1200000000003s)]
*  fund. You have to place bets and you have to be able to think from first principles and be [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2550.4s)]
*  intellectually rigorous. This is the most intellectually lazy approach. I'm just going [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2554.32s)]
*  to sign a piece of paper without even thinking. So no, I don't think he's out of line. I think [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2559.2000000000003s)]
*  it's an important lesson for people. This is not freedom of speech. This is owning your words. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2562.88s)]
*  You must own your words and position. And it's important that young people learn this now. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2567.68s)]
*  You have to own your words, whether it's on social media or signing some stupid petition [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2573.04s)]
*  that you didn't read. And there's a lot of backtracking going on right now, by the way. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2577.3599999999997s)]
*  I can't believe that if I got into Harvard, I would get auto drafted into the brown men's [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2581.52s)]
*  association just because of the color of my skin. That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2586.0s)]
*  Factory group. I mean, let's point out the double standard here that these elite [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2590.0s)]
*  Harvard students want to be exempt from their words, their statements. They don't want to be [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2594.8s)]
*  canceled for that. However, you know that when some hapless schmuck basically posts some tweet [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2600.2400000000002s)]
*  or posted a tweet 10 years ago that gets resurfaced, they're the first ones clamoring [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2606.7200000000003s)]
*  for their cancellation. Right. Yeah. They would like for their firing. They would like amnesty [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2612.1600000000003s)]
*  for their idiotic opinions. Yeah. Well, what's good for the goose here is good for the gander. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2617.36s)]
*  Absolutely. If they're going to create a cancel culture where people get canceled for their [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2621.92s)]
*  decade old tweets and so forth, then they should be prepared to live by that standard. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2626.96s)]
*  Now, look, personally, I would have some degree of forgiveness for a college student being part of [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2630.88s)]
*  an organization that puts out a statement. They're claiming they didn't know. Okay. But then why [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2638.08s)]
*  didn't you resign? Look, I don't think there's a good excuse for this other than youthful stupidity. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2642.48s)]
*  So I wouldn't cancel them forever. But look, I do think that it's fine for an appropriate [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2647.2s)]
*  for someone like the lack and say, I don't want to hire you people. Yeah. And I would just be [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2653.12s)]
*  careful for you to add the word youthful because I think it's just get out of jail free card. It's [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2656.56s)]
*  definitely stupidity. The question is, is the cake baked? And if the cake is baked, then there's a [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2661.3599999999997s)]
*  big argument to never hiring these people. I mean, look, I would just say your frontal lobes are [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2667.4399999999996s)]
*  still developing until you're 25 years old. So I would give college kids a bit of a pass if they [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2672.0s)]
*  do stupid stuff. You're there to learn. You're there to make mistakes. But that's not what I'm [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2676.64s)]
*  saying. This is a huge mistake. You're saying the bakes fully baked. You mean like their, their [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2680.0s)]
*  opinions and who they are. What I'm saying is you learn a lot from actions. Drink too much. Don't [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2684.08s)]
*  drink. Don't exercise enough. You get a little sluggish, maybe a little overweight. I get all [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2688.48s)]
*  of that. I'm not convinced that when you have this fundamentally specific way of thinking [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2692.4s)]
*  that you can unwind that so easily, Jason. So I'm not convinced that this mind virus gets fixed [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2701.04s)]
*  because you all of a sudden need a job. I actually think like maybe it's the struggle of realizing [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2708.32s)]
*  that there are deep consequences to this vein of thinking that this oppressed versus oppressor or [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2713.92s)]
*  the other way that it was framed in our group chat is that wokeism and the embracement of socialism [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2719.1200000000003s)]
*  is basically running away from excellence. It's this idea that everybody has to be the same. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2725.28s)]
*  What communism says, we all are the same. Nobody is special. We're all going to work together, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2730.88s)]
*  do the same things. We're all going to dress in the same ways. It's the collective we. There aren't [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2736.32s)]
*  going to be exceptional outliers. But the problem is that's not how the world works. And so the other [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2741.76s)]
*  part of why these woke madrasas are so terrible is that it teaches, I think, to work away from [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2747.6000000000004s)]
*  excellence and instead of striving for excellence to strive to be part of a collective. And I think [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2754.64s)]
*  that that is fundamentally corrosive to America. It's corrosive to what God is here. It's corrosive [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2759.04s)]
*  to all the great countries in the world. And so then again, it's like, why would you hire kids who [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2764.08s)]
*  fundamentally don't want to be excellent, who are afraid that if they were excellent, they would be [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2770.0s)]
*  guilty of something? That's ultimately the question. Why would any of these kids go to such an elite [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2775.52s)]
*  school to basically be taught that it's wrong to excel? All right. Well, let's say I think perhaps [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2782.08s)]
*  a good segue. And then as a result, not think for yourself. And then as a result, sign something [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2788.96s)]
*  like this, which is just stupid. We'll continue to discuss this topic, I guess, in the weeks ahead. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2793.7599999999998s)]
*  Again, hopefully this conversation was productive for the community, the all in community. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2799.84s)]
*  I understand that, you know, people might have very strong feelings about, you know, us discussing [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2805.6s)]
*  it, but we're here to discuss difficult topics. There's one other aspect to this, I think we [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2810.8s)]
*  should talk about, which is the United States is larger geopolitical situation right now. I mean, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2814.8s)]
*  things seem very tenuous. I did an event with Paul Merlucky, actually. Oh, friend of the pod. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2819.36s)]
*  Friend of the pod. Tell him I said hi. My invite got lost. Yeah, we actually had a nice debate, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2826.2400000000002s)]
*  slash discussion on Ukraine. But the thing that I think we agree with is that the US better [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2832.7200000000003s)]
*  bring more innovation into the military industrial complex and figure out like procurement, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2839.52s)]
*  because our whole cost plus system right now is so broken. There's an article recently in [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2846.08s)]
*  the New York Times where it said that the cost of the United States of producing an artillery shell [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2850.48s)]
*  is $6,000. For Russia, it's $600. So in other words, it costs the US 10 times what it costs [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2854.72s)]
*  Russia to produce an artillery shell, even though Russia is considered to be this super corrupt [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2862.08s)]
*  kleptocracy where everyone steals everything. And yet our procurement system is 10 times [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2866.56s)]
*  more efficient than theirs. We don't have competition and all the politicians are captured, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2872.7999999999997s)]
*  correct? We have this cost plus accounting system where every year the price goes up. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2876.4s)]
*  Good opportunity to explain that, yeah. So in every other part of technology, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2880.16s)]
*  price goes down over time, right? You can produce more of something for less. We've seen this with [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2885.92s)]
*  Tesla. We've seen it with PCs. We've seen it with television sets, whatever it is, the price goes [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2892.32s)]
*  down over time. Laptops, servers. Yeah. Or if the price goes up, it's because you've developed some [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2897.84s)]
*  fundamentally new capabilities, some new version. Yeah, more powerful chips, more storage. Yeah, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2902.8s)]
*  exactly. Faster speed. But we're still making the same artillery shells, the same Stinger missiles, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2907.36s)]
*  the same Javelins and so forth. I don't think the capabilities have changed that much, but the price [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2914.4s)]
*  goes up every year because it's cost plus. Explain cost plus. People might be hearing [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2918.88s)]
*  that for the first time. Well, most companies sell something and then they have a profit margin. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2924.4s)]
*  But the way that government procurement works is the profit margin is controlled. They're only [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2928.08s)]
*  allowed to market up a certain amount above their cost. But the thing that's happened in the defense [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2933.92s)]
*  industry is there's been huge consolidation over the past couple of decades where now you've got a [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2938.6400000000003s)]
*  handful of defense companies and it's an oligopoly. And many of these key armaments are single source, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2943.28s)]
*  so there's only one producer and they just keep raising the price every year. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2951.84s)]
*  Now, one of the kind of crazy things about this is, and Palmer made this point, is it's not like [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2955.44s)]
*  anyone's getting rich because of cost plus. It's not like the money is basically making these [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2960.8s)]
*  companies in order to be profitable. There's no incentive to lower the price. If you lower the price [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2966.6400000000003s)]
*  and you're at 10% and you got your $6,000 down to 4,000, 10% of 4,000 is a lot less than 10% of 6,000. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2971.04s)]
*  What's happening is not Google-like margins. What's happening is that these companies keep [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2977.12s)]
*  building their bureaucracies bigger and bigger. So they hire lots of staff. They make a lot of [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2982.96s)]
*  campaign contributions. They fund think tanks. And so their cost structure just keeps getting [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2988.4s)]
*  more and more bloated. Right. And they're incentivized to do that. The more they charge, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2993.7599999999998s)]
*  the more they make. Right. Now, why am I bringing this up? Well, we're in a situation now where [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=2997.2s)]
*  Israel might be on the precipice of, well, they've declared war against Gaza and this thing could [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3002.56s)]
*  spiral out of control and become a regional war. They may be asking for weapons. They may be asking [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3008.7999999999997s)]
*  for weapons. We've already donated some. However, earlier this year, we used to have an ammunition [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3014.24s)]
*  stockpile in Israel. The United States did. It belonged to us, but it was there potentially in [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3019.52s)]
*  case of a problem in the region. And that artillery stockpile was basically taken and given [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3025.12s)]
*  to Ukraine. And remember, we ran out of the key type of ammunition in the Ukraine war, which is [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3032.7999999999997s)]
*  155-millimeter artillery shells. That's why we gave them cluster bombs. So the US is already [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3038.3199999999997s)]
*  dangerously low on ammunition. And that's before we get potentially another war or another front in [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3045.44s)]
*  this larger global conflagration that's happening. We get asked to support another country's war. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3054.4s)]
*  And to be clear, we're not at war, but we've been asked to donate weapons to Ukraine and we've been [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3058.48s)]
*  asked to donate weapons. I think Israelis have asked for weapons. I don't know if they formally [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3064.08s)]
*  asked, but we are obviously going to provide them. I think there's a bill making its way through [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3068.08s)]
*  right now that's going to give some aid to military assistance to Israel. By the way, we had- [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3072.32s)]
*  Israel also is a major builder of weapons too. I mean, their drone technology is incredibly [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3077.28s)]
*  refined and they sell weapons to Russia and the folks. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3083.76s)]
*  Oh yeah. Israel is nowhere near the Ukraine situation. Ukraine is 100% dependent on the [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3086.0800000000004s)]
*  United States for its military and for its economy. Israel has a vibrant military and [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3091.76s)]
*  economy without the United States. But the United States does make long-term security guarantees [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3097.36s)]
*  to Israel, not to fight its wars. There's no mutual defense treaty. However, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3103.92s)]
*  we do agree to provide them with weapons in the event of a war. So we do have obligations, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3108.08s)]
*  like long-standing obligations to them. This is an ally we've had for 75 years. However, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3115.12s)]
*  our stockpiles are dangerously depleted now because of the Ukraine war. And on top of that, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3120.0s)]
*  our procurement system is hopelessly broken. So in a world of rising multipolarity, where there are [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3125.36s)]
*  other great powers now in the system, where there are going to be more and more global threats, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3133.6s)]
*  I don't think we have a chance of maintaining our global position and supporting our allies [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3138.8s)]
*  unless we fix this. I mean, making artillery shells at 10 times more than what it costs Russia, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3145.44s)]
*  that's ridiculous. In Silicon Valley, we have now the funding of military startups and there's a [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3150.32s)]
*  whole new class of warfare, supersonics, drones. Innovation is the only advantage we have. It's [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3156.72s)]
*  the only advantage we have. And it's happening, right? I mean, this is one of the great things. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3163.28s)]
*  I mean, I understand Palmer is not a huge fan of mine, but I'm a huge fan of the work he's doing [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3165.84s)]
*  and other entrepreneurs are doing to make new weapons to keep us competitive because you can [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3171.28s)]
*  be sure China's making them. And so I think it's absolutely fantastic. I thought it was always very [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3175.76s)]
*  weird that Google, speaking of work madrasas, like Google employees were refusing to provide services, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3180.4s)]
*  like even basic cloud hosting services to the military. To benefit from democracy [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3188.24s)]
*  and living in America while then not supporting the military just seemed like the ultimate [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3196.16s)]
*  luxury belief to use Rob's term from the all insomniac mafia thoughts. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3201.7599999999998s)]
*  What does it take guys to, for this fever to break, for all of these people to realize that [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3207.6s)]
*  that level of corruption is not sustainable, that these ways of thinking are not sustainable, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3214.96s)]
*  that it's not an act of peace and prosperity, that we actually want excellence in society. We [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3221.04s)]
*  want people to be outliers. We want the whole of humanity to move forward. And that's not going to [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3225.6s)]
*  happen when we move necessarily as one blob, but a few people need to sort of clear the brush [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3230.96s)]
*  and lead the way and the rest of us will come in and fill it in behind them. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3237.04s)]
*  I think Vivek is the manifestation of it. I'll be totally honest. Like I think the reason he is [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3240.24s)]
*  going up in the polls and the reason people are drawn to him is because he's smart and he's [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3243.92s)]
*  exceptional. And he represents one of the great things about America is that there's people who [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3249.2000000000003s)]
*  want to win and they're smart and excellent. He represents excellence, right? He represents [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3254.96s)]
*  excellence. I think that's why people are drawn to him. And I think people are tired of [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3258.96s)]
*  and the military industrial complex, they're tired of corruption. They're tired of geriatric, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3264.2400000000002s)]
*  80-year-old politicians. We need young, successful people to take leadership positions. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3269.6s)]
*  And by the way, I really agree with what you're saying. I think that there's like, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3273.84s)]
*  excellence can show itself in different forms. I think why Obama was so profound and Joe Rogan [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3277.1200000000003s)]
*  said this was he was such a statesman. He was the best of us, but he demonstrated excellence in being [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3282.96s)]
*  composed and measured and thoughtful and strategic. He was just so excellent. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3291.04s)]
*  Clinton as well. Clinton was incredibly steeped in policy. He was excellent. He was intellectually [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3297.3599999999997s)]
*  a massive outlier. Obama is an intellectual outlier. Vivek is an intellectual outlier. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3307.6s)]
*  Let's get these people to change and run our system of government, please. I think we're soaking in it. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3313.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we need smarter, more capable people. I mean, you look at Biden and when he gave that speech [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3320.7999999999997s)]
*  in support of Israel, I mean, a lot of the words were right, but he was slurring his way through it. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3325.52s)]
*  It certainly did not inspire me with confidence. It was his best speech and it was concerning [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3329.6s)]
*  the fact that he's clearly in cognitive decline. You can see it in his ability to orate. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3335.44s)]
*  And it was his best speech and it was also troubling for me as somebody who voted for him [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3340.56s)]
*  to watch him slur his words or just not, it was clear he wasn't all there. And you're like, geez, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3346.08s)]
*  what are we showing to the world if this is the guy who's running the country? And if we reelect him, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3350.08s)]
*  now we're saying, hey, we want to have an 84 year old running the country who's not all there [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3354.7999999999997s)]
*  and is in cognitive decline. Let the guy retire. Let him spend time with his grandkids. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3358.88s)]
*  I think it's more people who are willing to vote for, not for what they want, but to prevent [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3362.24s)]
*  something else. And I think that that's what's so tragic about how we're thinking as a country right [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3368.64s)]
*  now. Yeah. And just to dish it out equally, I mean, I saw Trump give a recent speech where, look, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3374.16s)]
*  he's nowhere near the cognitive decline of Biden. I think he's still compas mentis, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3379.6s)]
*  but he's not as sharp as he used to be either. I mean, listen, I think America's basic situation, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3385.44s)]
*  and this has really been reaffirmed over the past week, is that we're no longer in unipolarity [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3390.64s)]
*  anymore. We're no longer the sole superpower. Yeah, not for some time. China is now a superpower. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3395.12s)]
*  They're probably the low cost manufacturer of the world. So when we talk about being able to make [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3401.2s)]
*  things like armaments and artillery shells and weapons, they have the ability to out-produce us. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3405.28s)]
*  That is very scary. There are other great powers in the system now. Russia has proven over the last [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3409.92s)]
*  five months through its victory in this counteroffensive that it is a power to be reckoned with. We cannot [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3415.28s)]
*  disregard their concerns anymore. And not only does America need, I think, top flight leaders, [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3420.4s)]
*  like intellectually, who are at the top of their game, but we also need new thinking. We need to [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3427.6000000000004s)]
*  be able to sidestep challenges and conflicts as opposed to walking into every single trap the way [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3432.88s)]
*  that Lindsey Graham wants us to. Again, I'll go back on the Ukraine war. I think it's really clear [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3438.4s)]
*  that we could have avoided that war if we had taken NATO expansion off the table. And whether [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3444.8s)]
*  you believe that or not, it was criminal not to try. If it was a 5% chance, it was worth trying. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3449.04s)]
*  So you and I would be in alignment. And now look at our situation. We're already mired in the [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3454.1600000000003s)]
*  Ukraine proxy war. Now Israel's on the brink. We need smarter people and smarter thinking in [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3458.8s)]
*  Washington. We are no longer the only superpower. We're going to have a really tough time in a [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3464.7200000000003s)]
*  multipolar world if we do not look for ways to de-escalate conflict when we can. Or, putting aside [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3469.1200000000003s)]
*  conflict, why are we not building deep ties with as many countries as possible? Deep cultural ties, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3476.88s)]
*  deep economic ties, deep diplomatic ties. Every time we are in dialogue with a country and we're [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3483.44s)]
*  building a relationship with that country, that means free people of the world are winning. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3489.52s)]
*  Every time we isolate a country, that does not go well for us. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3495.44s)]
*  You're right. We're sanctioning half the world. That's another big part of this problem. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3498.2400000000002s)]
*  The normalization of relationships and the deepening of relationships, that is the high [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3503.84s)]
*  order bit. And you need somebody in office who can do that. And if you look at [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3508.32s)]
*  how the hawks in the GOP or the hawks in the Democratic Party think, they think that we have [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3512.3199999999997s)]
*  to be at war with everybody. They think we have to isolate everybody. The fact that Trump went [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3518.72s)]
*  and that famous moment where he walked over in the DMZ in North Korea and was talking to [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3523.6s)]
*  Kim Jong-un, that moment you see on Kim Jong-un's face, we can put it in here, he is so happy to be [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3530.7999999999997s)]
*  recognized. Now listen, I understand. He has a shocked look on his face. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3537.12s)]
*  I can't believe this is happening. Right. The same way he did when Dennis Rodman came over. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3541.6s)]
*  No, it's like a fan meeting Taylor Swift. If you look at those videos and you compare it to this, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3545.52s)]
*  it's the same. And culture is our export. And I know this sounds- [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3550.0s)]
*  What you're talking about, Jason, is soft power. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3553.52s)]
*  Simplistic. Yes. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3554.7999999999997s)]
*  And it can't all be hard power because other countries have it too now. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3556.16s)]
*  We have to work on our soft power, but you're not going to enhance American soft power with all this [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3560.96s)]
*  belligerent rhetoric, really this omnidirectional belligerence that's coming out of Washington. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3565.04s)]
*  And this is why I think the smart thing for Blinken to do or the Biden administration is, [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3571.12s)]
*  yes, you reaffirm that you stand with Israel in the face of this unspeakable atrocity [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3576.32s)]
*  at the same time. And you don't have to do this right now because it is a little bit tough to do [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3581.68s)]
*  it right now. But at some point- Well, with a hundred hostages. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3585.7599999999998s)]
*  Soon. You have to reaffirm your support for the two-state solution. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3587.36s)]
*  Absolutely. And I think the United States [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3592.16s)]
*  has always supported- And by the way, I think Tony's done a [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3593.12s)]
*  really good job. But again, at the end of the day, Tony works for President Biden. And it's like, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3595.6s)]
*  Biden hasn't been nearly as definitive as he could have been. And Tony's had to clean it up. So [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3601.2s)]
*  one example of this is like in the Wall Street Journal, they immediately on Sunday- [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3606.32s)]
*  That was true. Went to blaming Iran, right? And then both the Israeli military intelligence [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3611.52s)]
*  and American intelligence, they had to do an entire press circuit to try to disarm this in a [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3618.32s)]
*  way that was not seen in a long time. And you have to ask yourself, why was that even happening? And [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3622.8s)]
*  it's like, well, whatever special interests wanted to get that on the front page of the [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3629.68s)]
*  Wall Street Journal was able to do it, but it has dangerous implications. And then what you need is [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3633.52s)]
*  a really strong leader that can step up and say, this is false. This is not happening. This is what [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3638.96s)]
*  we need. You needed an Obama in that situation. And I think that this is- [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3643.04s)]
*  Or a Clinton. Or a Clinton. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3647.2s)]
*  Reagan. And I think that this is an opportunity for us to ask ourselves, okay, who is the most [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3650.48s)]
*  dynamic, excellent candidate that can give us this and be open-minded and not make this line about [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3657.44s)]
*  Republican versus Democrat right now, because the world is getting super complicated. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3665.52s)]
*  We need someone hyper, hyper excellent and intellectually competent. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3670.16s)]
*  Well, I will say this for Trump is that he's the only president in recent memory who didn't [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3676.08s)]
*  give us any new wars. Best quality. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3682.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. I have a lot of- [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3684.16s)]
*  Despite all of his issues, I think he has a unique ability to project strength to the American [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3686.48s)]
*  public while not being one of these super hawks. He's actually, I'd say, relatively dovish. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3692.16s)]
*  Well, he actually walked through his secret plan. He said, I can't remember where this clip, [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3697.36s)]
*  but he said whenever he met with these folks, he basically left a 10% chance that he would nuke them. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3701.68s)]
*  That's what he said. And it turned out that that 10% was just enough where everybody- [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3708.32s)]
*  Just enough crazy for everybody to stay alive. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3713.2s)]
*  Well, see, I think the US already has enough deterrence. I think we've maxed out on deterrence. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3715.68s)]
*  I think the thing that was smart about Trump was that he was willing to do business. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3720.96s)]
*  He was willing to negotiate and he didn't feel the need to make these [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3726.0s)]
*  moral condemnations all the time. He was willing to meet with Kim Jong-un. He was willing to meet [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3730.64s)]
*  with Putin and Xi Jinping. And he avoided criticizing them personally. He didn't call them [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3736.16s)]
*  dictators. He talked about how smart they are. It's the art of the deal, right? I mean, [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3743.92s)]
*  at the end of the day, he's looking to do business. And we need a little bit more of that. And I think [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3748.32s)]
*  this is why Jared Kushner was successful is he went in there with the mindset of a businessman. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3752.8s)]
*  How do we find something that's beneficial to both sides? [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3757.36s)]
*  Totally right. I think that when Trump was elected, I was told that it was the end of [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3761.04s)]
*  the world. And that's what I thought. And I'd already underwritten him as an F, okay? And then [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3764.96s)]
*  four years into the presidency, he was probably like a C in my mind. And then as I get a little [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3770.7999999999997s)]
*  bit of distance away, I realized, no, hold on a second. This guy was like a BB plus. He was [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3779.12s)]
*  pretty good. And unfortunately, the few things that if he could have just pushed through, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3783.68s)]
*  would have really saved America. The biggest one being these 100-year bonds. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3791.2s)]
*  It would have kept America from getting to the precipice of fiscal ruin. And we'd be in a highly [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3794.96s)]
*  different situation. And I'm not sure we could have ever given him credit for it. But the further and [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3800.48s)]
*  further I get away from him and the less emotional I am, he did a pretty good job. He was a pretty [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3805.76s)]
*  good president. Don't forget that he tried to overturn the election and steal the election. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3810.6400000000003s)]
*  I voted for Hillary Clinton. I voted for Joe Biden. But this is the honest assessment. The guy did [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3815.04s)]
*  for the things that he was supposed to do a good job. And for where every other president found a [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3820.88s)]
*  way to frankly make our situation a little bit worse, specifically around wars, he did not do [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3826.0s)]
*  that. And that is a huge accomplishment that I think needs to be acknowledged. And he would have [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3832.48s)]
*  ripped up the Constitution and taken the presidency and stolen it. So just give that in mind as well. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3837.44s)]
*  Unless we give him a huge pass. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3843.44s)]
*  That's why he's not an A. He's a B. B plus. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3845.76s)]
*  Jason, you have to admit, if it weren't for the black swan of COVID, he would have been [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3850.32s)]
*  re-elected in a landslide. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3854.16s)]
*  Landslide. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3855.36s)]
*  It's quite possible he would have been re-elected. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3856.48s)]
*  By the way, at this rate, the way things are going in this country right now, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3860.8s)]
*  both economically and internationally, he's going to waltz into the White House. He's going to spend [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3864.16s)]
*  all of his time in the next year in the courthouses battling all of these lawsuits, the [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3869.84s)]
*  lawfare against him. He's not going to be able to campaign. And it won't even matter because [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3875.04s)]
*  people are going to be so done with this. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3879.76s)]
*  And nobody wants him as president again. So I think that's, nobody wants that. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3881.52s)]
*  Everybody wants new choices. All right, everybody. If you do not want to hear us talk about [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RAfff-oMKw&t=3886.32s)]
