# E165 Vision Pro use or lose? Meta vs Snap, SaaS recovery, AI investing, rolling real estate crisis
**All In Podcast:** [February 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k)
*  All right, Freeberg is back. Welcome back to the All In Podcast episode 160 something, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=0.0s)]
*  your favorite podcast in the world, yada, yada, yada. With me again, the chairman dictator [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5.12s)]
*  from off Polyhapetia, little rain man. Yeah, definitely David Sacks is here and back from [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  his time in the metaverse. We found him somewhere out in space in the solar system in his Apple [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=15.76s)]
*  goggles, your favorite, the Sultan of science. David Freeberg is back from the metaverse. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=22.72s)]
*  I missed you guys. Welcome home. Thanks for having me. What did you discover when you went [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=29.04s)]
*  to Uranus and Google class? Sorry, I use the Apple Vision Pro takeout. I ordered them I ordered them [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=34.08s)]
*  and I walked by the Apple Store and I was going to go in and try them. And there were so many [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=41.84s)]
*  lunatics in there. I was like, Yeah, I'm not doing it. But I ordered them you use you actually use [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=46.32s)]
*  them. I ordered one online to be delivered and it was like delayed by a month. So I went down to the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  Apple Store and picked one up. Okay, and my kids cannot stop using it. Really? I went down to the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=55.84s)]
*  Apple Store but got cleaned out by the thief to stole everything. So [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  I went to the Oakland one. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=65.44s)]
*  That was crazy. That was crazy. We'll put the video in here. To the idiots who are robbing [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=84.8s)]
*  Apple stores, all the devices get bricked when you steal them. And they all have GPS in them. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=88.96s)]
*  Have you tried it? No, I was too busy working out making love and winning. Oh, okay. So you were [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=93.44s)]
*  you're making sweet love. You were watching your portfolio go up. And you were just generally [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=100.32s)]
*  winning. Got it. Got it. Yeah. Yeah. So freeburg, the rest of us were being men in the world [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  accomplishing stuff. But but do tell us about your time in the metaverse. Do those goggles come with [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=111.12s)]
*  a lifetime prescription of SSRIs? You guys sound like one of these like tech journalists that are [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=116.4s)]
*  actually anti tech people you guys are journalists like it talking about the next [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=122.56s)]
*  gen computing platform. I remember when the iPad came out and everyone pooped with the iPad. I [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=127.92s)]
*  thought it was stupid. I tried to use it. I couldn't get any value out of it. And in 2010 or 2011, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=131.84s)]
*  when did it come out 2010 2011, we started using it with our sales team selling to farmers. And we [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=137.36s)]
*  gave every sales guy an iPad and they went out in the field with 3g. And they were able to close [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=142.4s)]
*  sales in the field meeting with farmers, which had never been done before. Usually I have to get a [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=147.76s)]
*  farmer to come into an office. How many iPads sold the product? So we had like, no, they were [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=151.44s)]
*  selling climate.com software. We had dozens of these sales guys, we gave them out to our sales [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=157.04s)]
*  agents as well, the independent agents, they started using them. And it was like a real [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=161.68s)]
*  game changer in how sales was done in agriculture. And I had never even contemplated that when I [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=165.2s)]
*  first used the iPad. So let's let's get to breast tax here. What is the killer app? What do you [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=169.92s)]
*  think in the next five years, people are going to be doing with this thing on a daily basis? Is [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=174.24s)]
*  there a daily use case? I'll say a couple things. One is like, I feel the same way I did about the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=178.56s)]
*  iPad, which is I don't know what it is today, but I can tell that there's something there. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=182.96s)]
*  And I'll give you an example of something I thought about. First of all, the AR is game changing. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=186.16s)]
*  Okay, if you've used like the meta, yeah, the Oculus Quest, it like makes me super dizzy, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=190.24s)]
*  makes my head hurt, makes my eyes hurt, like you're super disoriented. What Apple solved is that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=196.16s)]
*  you're like still in reality. But then you get to interact with these three dimensional kind of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=200.8s)]
*  objects in reality. And it's like really well done. It's definitely the one and there's going [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=205.92s)]
*  to be incredible changes in the next couple of generations. But it gets rid of all that dizziness, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  disconnected kind of stuff that happens with the full VR experience, which I thought was really [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  incredible. Then last week, and I'm sorry, I missed the show, we have a facility with my company in [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  North Carolina, we have this giant greenhouse facility. And I was doing meetings with farmers [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  and stuff. I go to the greenhouse facility. And there's so much work that the greenhouse [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=228.64s)]
*  techs and lab techs are doing, where they're using an iPhone and a barcode scanner and a [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=233.68s)]
*  printer. And they're holding all these pieces of equipment, scanning the QR codes on flowers, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  taking the pollen out, putting it in the next flower, training each other how to do it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=244.08s)]
*  And I was like, I put this Apple Vision Pro on. And I was like, man, all the apps and all the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=248.24s)]
*  tools that we had all these different pieces for that was taking people tons of time, image [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=253.44s)]
*  collection, data collection, could all just be done, streamlined while you're working. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=257.44s)]
*  You could have a task report. Yeah, you have a task list on the right. Cameras are taking images [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=262.8s)]
*  in the middle, QR codes are automatically scanned, data is being ingested. The task list is kind of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=268.16s)]
*  giving folks next steps. They could listen to music while they're working. And I realized for [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=273.52000000000004s)]
*  that job, and I met with all the team out there and spent time with them. And I actually did the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=277.92s)]
*  work that they do to get a better sense for the workflow. And I was like, man, literally every [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  aspect of this job will be massively improved and productivity will go up by 10x with these goggles. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=286.16s)]
*  Will it happen in the next couple of weeks or months? I don't know. But my engineering team [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=290.88s)]
*  is looking into it. Can we take it? Can we use some software? Can we build some software? And [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  can we put this on folks to give them a better work experience, increase our productivity, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=298.0s)]
*  to do automated data capture? So I don't know exactly where it goes. But I could start to see [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=302.88s)]
*  how this can become a more ubiquitous part of a workforce setting and not just be a video game [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=306.96s)]
*  and movie tool for consumers. So I'm reasonably optimistic about where this goes. It's definitely [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=311.6s)]
*  V1. I feel like it's the iPad days where no one's really sure where the applications are. But yeah, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=316.24s)]
*  enterprise applications. Unbelievable. Makes total sense. And also training, training, right? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=321.2s)]
*  Assembly line workforce, sure house workers, where you're getting real time kind of task updates, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=325.76s)]
*  data is being ingested all in real time. And by the way, the other thing I'll say is training is [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  incredible. There's spatial video recording on it. So it looks like you're living through the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=336.0s)]
*  experience that someone else had. So you can train someone how to do a difficult task. And rather [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=340.24s)]
*  than have a human go spend hours training a workforce, the workforce can be trained by the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  goggles in a way that you cannot do with two dimensional video today. So I don't know, I'm [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=349.12s)]
*  pretty optimistic. Very strange days, right? I don't know. You're a fan of sci fi, but remember [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=353.68s)]
*  strange days? So Tramoth, what's going to happen first year? Are humans going to become more like [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  robots by putting these on and do this factory work? Or is Elon with optimists and some of humane, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=363.68s)]
*  I think is the other one. There's a couple of other people building a general use robots. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=369.12s)]
*  Figures the other one. Figure. Yeah. Which one wins the day? Is it going to be humans having [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=372.72s)]
*  eyes and you know, data collection like robots or robots having appendages like humans? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=378.0s)]
*  Well, let me let me put two ideas together and see what you think of this argument. If you think [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=384.48s)]
*  about the generation of human beings that have as close to any other generation before it lived in [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=390.56s)]
*  a totally immersive world, I would say the best representation of that are current teenagers and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=399.6s)]
*  20 year old people. And maybe at the upper edge, the early 30s people. And why is that, you know, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=406.72s)]
*  they've lived inside of social media their entire lives, they've lived inside of immersive video [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=413.92s)]
*  games their entire lives. But the question is, are they better off and happier, as far as we know, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=417.68s)]
*  from an evolutionary perspective, and I would tell you that the answer is a is a huge gaping no. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=423.6s)]
*  So if you believe that the rise in depression, the rise in suicide, the dependency on drugs, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=430.32s)]
*  the dependency on SSRIs, the sexual promiscuity, the lack of marriage, the lack of kids, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=440.64s)]
*  if all of those things are in some ways, a correlated byproduct, let's not say it's causal, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=447.12s)]
*  right? Let's say it's a correlated byproduct of this entire immersive, almost exclusionary [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=453.68s)]
*  detached world that these folks have grown up in. Taking that to the limit, I'm just going to put [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=460.56s)]
*  out there may not be the solution to our problems. And so I guess the more directed answer to your [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=467.52s)]
*  question is, I would hope that the latter wins, so that we take these goggles off and actually [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=473.2s)]
*  learn how to talk to each other and look each other in the eyes, get married and have children, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=477.68s)]
*  because I think that's actually better for the world. And I would probably say that it's almost [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=482.4s)]
*  better for the world than a 10xing of productivity. Interesting. And then you see the correlation to [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=488.0s)]
*  cancer and disease that is disproportionately higher amongst these young people. So I think [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=494.0s)]
*  it's at some point to ask ourselves, what is structurally happening in the lives of these 16, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=498.64s)]
*  15 to 31 year olds that is just so poor in terms of outcomes. And if you look at some of the [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=505.44s)]
*  environmental variables that they live in, and then take some of those and take them to the limit, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=513.04s)]
*  I think that there's a reasonable argument that their lives get worse before it gets better. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=518.0s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Yeah, I mean, the amount of time you spend on social media is correlated [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=521.76s)]
*  with depression. Yeah. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=526.08s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Not just social media, I'm just saying, just this immersive, like, I'm going to [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=526.4s)]
*  detach from the world and live through a microphone and glasses taken to the limit, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=529.76s)]
*  I'm not sure is the solution to these kids feeling detached, lonely, isolated. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=535.04s)]
*  David Erickson Yeah, I mean, it correlates all of these things that we're seeing in this younger [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=540.56s)]
*  generation correlates with the introduction of the smartphone. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=545.4399999999999s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell So could it be a good productivity device? Yes. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=546.8s)]
*  David Erickson Of course. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=548.8s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Do I hope it's a good productivity device? Yes. But if we try to make it the panacea [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=549.28s)]
*  for anything and everything, I think we're going to compound the systemic issues that [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=553.36s)]
*  these young people have. And I suspect on the margin, if you were going to bet, all of these [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=559.68s)]
*  things that we see in these young people today will get worse as a byproduct of technology, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=565.3599999999999s)]
*  not necessarily get better. So if you can take a different path, like Optimus, or the figure AI [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=569.5999999999999s)]
*  robots, where that work is done, at least we have a different problem, probably maybe even [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=575.92s)]
*  more existential. Aaron Ross Powell [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=581.52s)]
*  Abundance. David Erickson [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=582.7199999999999s)]
*  But a different problem, which is now how do you find purpose, but maybe you can find purpose [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=583.92s)]
*  through connection and the types of things that humans have been bred over billions of years to [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=587.28s)]
*  actually optimize for. Aaron Ross Powell [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=592.0s)]
*  Okay. Sax, I remember when you were starting craft, you fired up like a group for VR and you [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=593.68s)]
*  got pretty heavy into it. You made a couple of small bets. I remember that I don't think any of [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=602.48s)]
*  it worked out really, you could tell me if I'm wrong here, but you got in a little bit earlier [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=606.9599999999999s)]
*  there. Maybe you could talk about the business case for this. And has that changed? Because [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=610.48s)]
*  you believed, I believed a lot of folks thought, hey, maybe this is the time when Zuck really [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=614.64s)]
*  started, you know, had bought Oculus and they started putting out some good product. Seemed [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=620.0s)]
*  like it was a false start. Is this the actual starting pistol? And is this the start of the VR [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=624.16s)]
*  AR adoption race? David Erickson [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=628.64s)]
*  I don't think we're quite there yet. We've been talking about VR being a thing for over a decade. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=631.68s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell More like 30. Remember the Nintendo VR stuff? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=639.4399999999999s)]
*  David Erickson It's like always on the verge of happening. I think that the big complaint about [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=642.88s)]
*  the Apple device is it has a lot of capability, but it's still a pretty huge device to wear on [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=646.24s)]
*  your forehead. This is not really going to be comfortable enough to be something that people [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=650.8s)]
*  want to use all the time. I mean, there's also a question of use cases, but they're getting there [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=656.16s)]
*  with the use cases. In any event, I do think that Apple Vision Pro is, it's like I said last week, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=662.4s)]
*  it's a useful prototype or proof of concept, and it will get better. So I'm glad they did it. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=669.84s)]
*  Because I think you need to start somewhere and then just keep iterating. But eventually for this [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=677.28s)]
*  to, I think, really take off, you need to shrink the form factor, miniaturize the technology, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=681.76s)]
*  just every version of it, make it simpler, lighter, easier to use. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=689.36s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Yeah, I mean, eventually it'll feel like sunglasses. And so that is, I guess, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=693.28s)]
*  if they become like regular glasses, I think we all agree, it becomes a next computer platform. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=698.96s)]
*  David Erickson I don't know. I got to tell you, I feel like it's pretty damn comfortable. I don't [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=701.84s)]
*  know if you guys, you guys haven't really used it, but- [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=704.72s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell That's what I've heard. That's the surprise. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=706.4s)]
*  David Erickson I was totally surprised- [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=707.76s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell People are online saying it's comfortable. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=708.24s)]
*  David Erickson Unlike any other headset I've ever worn, they did an incredible job designing [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=710.24s)]
*  the ergonomics of it. Aaron Ross Powell What does it feel like? Does it feel like ski goggles? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=714.08s)]
*  It doesn't feel heavy. It doesn't feel pressed pressure. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=717.4399999999999s)]
*  David Erickson Compared to ski goggles. If you were wearing ski goggles- [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=720.0799999999999s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell It's less constricting than ski goggles. It's more comfortable. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=723.04s)]
*  It like floats on you a little bit. They did a great job with this cushioning device they built [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=725.92s)]
*  and the band you put on. It feels very natural. It's Apple design, right? It's like a really well [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=730.16s)]
*  designed product. That's unlike anything else you've ever tried. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=734.4799999999999s)]
*  David Erickson I've always felt like when Apple comes into the race, that's the starter's pistol. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=737.3599999999999s)]
*  And I think this is it because I've heard the same thing from everybody. You have to try it. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=741.28s)]
*  It feels like different than Oculus and some of those versions that came out previously. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=746.16s)]
*  And they have the app ecosystem. And I would not discount that when you know, the ability to [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=751.04s)]
*  monetize the app ecosystem and have all the people who are already building the com app, the Uber app, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=756.7199999999999s)]
*  whatever notion, you know, all the stuff that people use and love, Spotify, YouTube, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=761.8399999999999s)]
*  and then ported over here, Fortnite, whatever. I think that's going to be the magic. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=767.68s)]
*  And the statistics are not lying here. I mean, this is unbelievable. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=771.92s)]
*  They've sold already 200,000 units, which doesn't seem like a lot. But for V1, that is a lot. And [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=775.76s)]
*  they're going to sell a half million this year. It's gonna be close to like, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=781.68s)]
*  Peter T. Lenny That's not that many. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=784.64s)]
*  David Erickson Well, it's a couple of billion. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=785.84s)]
*  Peter T. Lenny I mean, Meta sells more. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=786.8s)]
*  David Erickson They do. Yeah. But you know, this is $4,000. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=788.16s)]
*  This isn't 500. So to sell that many of a $4,000 device is incredible. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=792.56s)]
*  Peter T. Lenny It's a proof of concept. It's not like a [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=796.72s)]
*  regular Apple product that is a mass market device that 10s or 100s of millions of people [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=799.76s)]
*  are going to buy. But it puts them on a path to where they can iterate and keep making it better. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=805.68s)]
*  David Erickson See, I think, and this is, I guess, what I'd [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=810.16s)]
*  ask Freeberg, do you compare this to buying a MacBook Pro, buying an iPhone, or buying the [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=812.48s)]
*  Oculus, you know, whatever they, you know, $500 unit, because everybody I see talking about online [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=818.64s)]
*  is comparing it to the purchase of a laptop, because of the desktop, and you can kind of [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=824.64s)]
*  do your coding or surf the web and do all that. Where do you put this? Is it buying a TV? Is it [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=829.4399999999999s)]
*  buying a laptop? Is it buying a smartphone? What would you say the keyboard to be really productive [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=833.6s)]
*  on it? If you're going to use it for writing purposes or coding purposes, so it doesn't really [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=837.84s)]
*  work with just the headset, but you could do that. Yeah, it's definitely like buying a new computing [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=842.96s)]
*  device. But people felt the same way about the iPad. I get go back to 2010, when the iPad came [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=848.24s)]
*  out. And everyone was like, who is it for? It's a whole new computer. Who's it for? You already have [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=852.88s)]
*  a phone, you already have a computer. Why do you need an iPad? And then they sell tens of millions [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=858.72s)]
*  a quarter now. So I really, as I do the math on this, I was just kind of doing some back of the [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=862.88s)]
*  envelope stuff. I think they're going to sell $100 billion of Apple vision pros, not this version, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=867.2s)]
*  but this version plus the next version, probably over the next, I would guess for them to get to [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=872.4s)]
*  $100 billion in sales, it'll take them less than five years. I think they're going to run the table [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=878.0s)]
*  on everybody. I think they're going to own the entire space. Everyone's underestimating this as [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=883.36s)]
*  a new computing platform. And once these applications, particularly in the enterprise setting, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=887.6s)]
*  start to kick in, and I will say that the movie watching experience is way better than watching [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=891.68s)]
*  on a TV in your living room. My kids cannot stop asking me to use the goggles to watch instead of [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=895.84s)]
*  an iPad or TV. Because you see 3D, like all Pixar movies are natively 3D. And so you've got the [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=900.4s)]
*  Disney plus app on there, you watch a Pixar movie, and you're watching in 3D, the kids are blown away. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=907.2s)]
*  So I think we're all going to be surprised by how this goes. Disney's all in on it. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=912.1600000000001s)]
*  Remember when our parents told us not to sit too close to the TV. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=915.9200000000001s)]
*  Now we're just strapping the thing to our face. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=919.6800000000001s)]
*  I had the most Silicon Valley moment ever. I go to buy a cup of coffee. I was going for a little [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=922.88s)]
*  walk. I see blue bottle. I'm like, Oh, you know, I get myself a mocha, you know, I lost a little [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=928.32s)]
*  bit of weight. I'm going to treat myself $9 for a mocha. Number one, that in the city tilted me. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=931.44s)]
*  $9 for a mocha? $8 and then I gave a dollar tip and then I felt cheap giving a dollar. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=937.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, it's $8.99 for a carton of clover milk all organic. I mean, you can make infinite lattes [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=943.5200000000001s)]
*  at home. Anyway, where did you go for your $9 mocha? I was I'm in Palo Alto right now because [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=950.0s)]
*  we lost the blue bottle. Yeah, I posted this. I'm like $9. What am I doing? You know, I just I felt [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=955.6s)]
*  like buying a chocolate bar and dirty lips left on the cup. Look at you know, you're a little [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=962.08s)]
*  obsessed with my lip. Take it easy. So anyway, then there's a kid in the place wearing the goggles [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=968.88s)]
*  with the keyboard. No, no, stop, stop, he's getting work done. This kid was doing work. And [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=976.1600000000001s)]
*  I tell you the truth in the hours he was putting in the hours. No one looks at your laptop. No, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=982.64s)]
*  that's what I love about your work without anyone seeing what you're doing. This kid had four [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=987.6s)]
*  desktops up. This guy was probably on porn hub, Spotify, writing code. How many words did this [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=991.44s)]
*  person say to another human being while you were there? No zero. And you know, when they're on a [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=997.9200000000001s)]
*  laptop, they're the same. What's the difference? He's coding nobody bad and I think this is gonna [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1001.7600000000001s)]
*  they're gonna run the table on this. I think it's 100 billion sales. 100 million sales under five [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1006.6400000000001s)]
*  years. Yeah, I take the over. Yeah, I take the over. What do you got the over the under? Because [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1011.6s)]
*  even if they keep it at three grand, they got to sell 30 million units to get to 100 billion. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1016.0s)]
*  They're gonna make up a lot of money on this app store too, by the way. You guys are right that [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1020.48s)]
*  it's going to be successful in terms of revenue. What I'm asking is a more societal question is [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1023.76s)]
*  do you guys actually think it's better? No, I don't want my kids in this all day. No, and I [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1028.72s)]
*  can see this becoming super-dicking. Hey, Freeberg, can I buy three for your kids? Just have them walk [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1032.16s)]
*  around with them? No, I have a no iPad in the house rule as well. But wait a minute, hold on. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1036.56s)]
*  What about productivity, Freeberg? My kids aren't trying to be productive. They're using it to burn [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1040.08s)]

*  productive. You guys understand that at some point you guys will be the only six kids whose [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1048.64s)]
*  parents haven't given them the stupid thing to put on their face? No, this is going to be time [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1054.4s)]
*  restricted. I have a no iPad, no phone, no like I let them use the headset. But it's so good for [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1059.0400000000002s)]
*  them. No, no, it burns their brain away. Burns their brain away. It's terrible. I totally agree [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1064.8000000000002s)]
*  with you. Social interaction, the loss of our ability to communicate as humans is critical, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1071.2800000000002s)]
*  and it's a fail point. I do think that there are applications where these things create great [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1076.08s)]
*  unlocks. I think this is an enterprise device. Can you imagine giving the sales team on the farms [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1079.6799999999998s)]
*  to go there? They can take off their sweaty headset when the sun is shining and then give it to the [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1084.48s)]
*  farmer to put on and then he can put it on and feel the sweat and the headband will be wet. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1089.04s)]
*  No, that's not the use case. It doesn't, by the way, it's a very personal device. In order to log [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1094.1599999999999s)]
*  in, you know, it does like a eye scan or you have to have like a lock in, like log in, like you do [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1099.04s)]
*  with your phone, but then you got to reset the eye because it automatically sets the eye position. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1103.76s)]
*  So when you put on someone else's headset, you got to reset the eye. It's a whole thing. So it's not [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1107.84s)]
*  a transferable device. It's a very personal computing, you know, kind of thing. So I don't [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1112.08s)]
*  think it's going to be the same as like an iPad or a phone. It's a very different kind of thing. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1116.64s)]
*  I don't know what it's going to look like yet. I don't know. I say next week, we do the show [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1119.6s)]
*  inside of these, or at least me and you, Freebird will be, will be, is there a zoom for this? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1122.56s)]
*  There's a, there's an, there's an avatar thing. And so what it does, it scans your face while [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1128.08s)]
*  you're talking and all four of us can see each other as the avatar. Yeah. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1132.64s)]
*  Wow. Let's do it. It'd be hilarious. I had a moment this week in parenting. I had a moment [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1136.4s)]
*  this week where I told one of my children that when I send a text message, I expect an immediate [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1140.88s)]
*  response. Otherwise I am going to cancel that child's phone and take it away. And then separately, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1147.3600000000001s)]
*  when they respond, it has to be in structured, well thought out, perfectly formatted English. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1154.48s)]
*  And then, then third, I said, every single email I see from you interacting with your teachers or [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1160.1599999999999s)]
*  anybody else that's there to help you needs to be incredibly well written and formatted. And if I see [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1166.56s)]
*  garbage English, I'm going to take your phone away. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1172.08s)]
*  Okay. So you don't want them on their phones, but they have to respond right away. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1175.04s)]
*  Well, they have very strict rules on what they can use. They're there for literally, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1178.8799999999999s)]
*  all they can do is communicate. Like they can use iMessage. But it is shocking to me that despite [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1182.56s)]
*  the lack of games that they have or whatever, how poor they are in being able to communicate [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1188.4s)]
*  and what little access to devices they have, have already made them orders of magnitude, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1195.3600000000001s)]
*  less able to communicate than frankly, I was able to when I was their age. And so [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1203.3600000000001s)]
*  I can just imagine what happens when you become even more ensconced in something that you can [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1207.68s)]
*  cocoon yourself with and not have to interact with the rest of the world. I don't disagree with you. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1212.24s)]
*  I don't disagree with you. Not to say that it's not going to be a revenue generator, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1215.4399999999998s)]
*  but I think that you could just as easily frankly, instead of impacting Apple's revenues, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1219.6s)]
*  you can probably go along the makers of SSRIs. Here comes a spread trade. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1225.28s)]
*  Pot. Bumble and Tinder, and you'll get to the same place economically. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1231.28s)]
*  All right. All right, here we go. We've got a lot on the- [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1236.24s)]
*  What a great leap forward for humanity. I can't wait. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1239.04s)]
*  So I just see this as a laptop replacement. Okay. I wanted to talk a little bit about [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1242.0800000000002s)]
*  what apparently is going to be the spread trade of the last year. Meta is continued their [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1248.24s)]
*  unbelievable run and Snap dropped like 30%. Here's a chart for y'all of Snap versus Meta. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1253.8400000000001s)]
*  You can take a quick look at it here. And just for context, both companies did great during COVID [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1261.04s)]
*  and Zerp hit all-time highs in 2021, but they both got crushed due to the ad spend pullback, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1266.88s)]
*  obviously. But then Meta started to get less focused on their headsets and more focused on AI. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1271.68s)]
*  Started doing their reduction in head count 22% year over year from 86,000 to 67,000 the last [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1277.6000000000001s)]
*  quarter for Meta. And their quarterly profits have increased to an all-time high of $14 billion. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1285.2800000000002s)]
*  That's profits, folks, in Q4 for Meta. Ball time high for the stock price $470 a share, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1292.16s)]
*  $1.2 trillion market cap. Snap down 60% from its closing price on its IPO day in 2017. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1299.04s)]
*  Let me just jump to Chamath before I get into more charts and everything. You pointed out, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1306.8799999999999s)]
*  Chamath, and maybe you could explain to the audience just how ridiculous [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1310.56s)]
*  the voting rights were and the massive dependence that the Snap team and the executives had on [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1313.92s)]
*  stock-based comp, two issues for you, Chamath. Well, I mean, I think I said it before. I think [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1322.72s)]
*  that case studies had been written about how tilted the governance is in Snap. I think the point is [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1328.72s)]
*  that they basically have infinite to zero voting power over common shareholders. So there's no real [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1335.8400000000001s)]
*  feedback loop. And I think that that has probably adversely affected the types of people [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1342.24s)]
*  that traffic in their stock. Now, look, activists and short sellers sometimes have a very bad [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1348.8s)]
*  reputation. But if you steel man their side of it, what they are there to do is to shine a light [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1357.6s)]
*  on inefficiency and in the short seller case, sometimes in propriety, but it should all lead [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1365.2s)]
*  to companies being better run. I think Metta had this example where they had a really big hiccup, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1371.2s)]
*  and everybody, including us, pointed out the levels of spend that they were making [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1380.0800000000002s)]
*  really didn't make any sense. I think we had a chart that compared the level of spend of Metta [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1386.88s)]
*  second only to the Spaceship program. Just like- [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1391.0400000000002s)]
*  Bonkers. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1395.5200000000002s)]
*  An enormous amount of money. And look, Mark got the message. He heard it loud and clear. I think [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1396.16s)]
*  he got fed up with whatever was going on there and he fixed it. And it's in the numbers. Now, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1402.88s)]
*  I don't know Snap because to be honest with you, I've never taken more than one second to look at [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1408.88s)]
*  that company. And the reason is, there's just zero ability for me to have any useful say. So I've [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1414.0s)]
*  never honestly looked at its performance. I've never studied a single characteristic. I've never [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1420.3200000000002s)]
*  trended it. And I think the point is that I am probably where a lot of other reasonably smart [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1425.28s)]
*  folks who could give a reasoned opinion on how to make it better land. And part of the reason is [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1432.24s)]
*  because there is no feedback loop that matters. And when you know that, why would you waste your [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1439.04s)]
*  time? At least in the- There are other options, right? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1444.8s)]
*  There are other options. And Metta was another one. You can write a letter. It gets picked up on [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1446.8799999999999s)]
*  CNBC and Bloomberg and whatever. And all of a sudden they kind of pay attention. And I think, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1452.48s)]
*  and you look at Disney, Nelson Peltz goes and gets Eich Perlmutter shares, buys some more, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1457.76s)]
*  takes a large position. We'll see whether that fixes itself. The point is that in all of these [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1462.72s)]
*  other cases, people are investing the time because they think that there's even a small shred of a [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1468.24s)]
*  chance that the company listens. But if you literally have no say, you couldn't even do a [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1474.24s)]
*  proxy, you couldn't vote the shares, why would you bother? And I think that's more of an example [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1480.16s)]
*  where maybe there is a- So I don't even know why snapped it poorly. And again, I'm not going to [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1485.28s)]
*  really take the time because it's like, why bother taking the time? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1490.96s)]
*  Aaron Norris Sack, should they unwind this like no voting, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1493.68s)]
*  common shares, super voting shares nonsense? And should this go away as a concept in the stock [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1497.3600000000001s)]
*  market? Sack Well, I mean, Facebook or Metta has a pretty similar concept. I mean, I guess [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1503.28s)]
*  Zuckerberg has 60% of voting control, whereas Evan Spiegel is 99%. So Snap is more egregious. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1510.08s)]
*  The difference is that Zuckerberg is listening and Spiegel is not. The reason why Snap is doing [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1517.12s)]
*  poorly is not because its revenue has deteriorated. So I looked up, let's put it this way, I asked [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1525.36s)]
*  Chad GPT for their key metrics. So assuming GPT is not hallucinating, if you compare 2021 to 2023, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1531.36s)]
*  their total revenue went up from 4.1 to 4.5 billion and gross profit went from call it 2.4 to 2.5 [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1540.4799999999998s)]
*  billion. So not a huge increase, but revenue and gross profit were slightly up. But if you look at [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1550.3999999999999s)]
*  operating expenses, they went from 3 billion to 4 billion a year. And that is why their operating [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1556.16s)]
*  income or operating loss went from a $700 million loss to $1.4 billion loss in two years. So that's [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1563.2s)]
*  the source of the problem is that they increase their operating expense by a billion dollars a year [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1571.3600000000001s)]
*  from 2021 to 2023. It's pretty simple. Aaron Norris They seem like they're the last ones to get the [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1578.88s)]
*  memo. Chad Yeah, they were the last ones to get the memo and just finish the point. So you saw that [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1583.84s)]
*  a few days ahead of this quarterly announcement, where their stock got crushed, they put out a [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1589.12s)]
*  press release saying they're going to cut their headcount 10%. It's too little too late. Yeah, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1594.48s)]
*  they knew, right? They knew they had a problem. So they released the press release saying, oh, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1599.76s)]
*  we're going to cut. Well, you should have done what Zuckerberg did. Zuckerberg did a 20% cut [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1604.56s)]
*  last year. He got serious. He got lean and fit. And instead, these guys held out, did nothing. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1610.96s)]
*  Then when they know that the market's going to crush them, they put out this lame announcement, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1617.92s)]
*  10%. No, not 10%. Really, if you just want to get back to where you were two years ago, in terms of [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1622.08s)]
*  operating expense, you need a 25% reduction. Aaron Norris Yeah, yeah. But it's more than that. If [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1629.44s)]
*  you look at the numbers, let's use operating cashflow, it's 165 million for Snap for the quarter. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1634.56s)]
*  So their operations generated 165 million of profit. But for the entire year, because they [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1639.76s)]
*  lost money in the quarters prior, they generated free cashflow of only $35 million. So the business [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1645.6s)]
*  net produced $35 million of incremental cash. You know how stock based comp accounting works, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1652.32s)]
*  the charge happens when it vests. So this is what employees are vesting. During the year of 2023, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1658.24s)]
*  employees vested $1.3 billion of stock based comp. So that means new shares or options were [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1664.4s)]
*  issued, that on an accounting basis, the options are valued using black shoals, and the shares are [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1670.0s)]
*  valued based on the share price. So they issued 1.3 billion of stock based comp. So they generated [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1674.64s)]
*  35 million of free cash. And they use $1.3 billion to compensate employees beyond their OPEC. So that [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1679.2s)]
*  means that they paid employees 40 times the free cashflow that was generated for shareholders [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1686.0s)]
*  during the year, which is also equivalent to 10% of the enterprise market value of this company. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1692.08s)]
*  So the enterprise value of the company is $15 billion. 10% of that was issued to employees [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1698.72s)]
*  to compensate them. Now let me give you the story of another city, Metta. And by the way, Snap's [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1704.32s)]
*  share count, because they issued all the stock, the number of shares outstanding increased by 4% [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1709.1999999999998s)]
*  during the year. During the year Metta's number of shares outstanding decreased by half a percent, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1714.6399999999999s)]
*  because they used cash to go and buy back stocks. So they were able to reduce the shares outstanding. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1720.72s)]
*  Now, as you guys talked about, Metta cut employee count by 22%. And Snap cut employee headcounts by [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1725.28s)]
*  3% during the year. But here's the crazy difference in performance. The stock based comp expense [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1731.04s)]
*  for Metta during that year was about $14 billion that vested that year. That company generated 71 [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1737.68s)]
*  billion of operating cashflow. So while Snap gave employees 40 times the free cashflow, Metta gave [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1744.72s)]
*  employees about 20% of the free cashflow. And then Metta went around and they used some of that extra [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1752.24s)]
*  cash to buy back $20 billion of stock. So they bought back more shares than what the employees [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1758.96s)]
*  were issued that year were. So it shows such a difference in looking out for shareholders. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1764.24s)]
*  So if I'm an investor, and by the way, Metta is creating it like 25 times free cashflow, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1770.4s)]
*  which is not a crazy multiple, given all the new businesses that they have in Lamottu and [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1774.24s)]
*  the progression to cloud and other things that they might do. If I'm looking at those two businesses [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1778.32s)]
*  as a shareholder, you got this guy that controls the whole stock. He's giving employees a billion [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1782.48s)]
*  three of shares a year when he's only making $30 million of free cashflow a year. And then the other [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1787.28s)]
*  guy is issuing $14 billion of shares, buying them all back. And he's making 70 billion of free cashflow [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1792.32s)]
*  a year. I don't know. It's very hard to decide which one to go after. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1798.64s)]
*  Spiegel brought it up in an interview I saw in a lot of the layoffs were top heavy. So he got rid [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1801.6s)]
*  of a lot of the top people who had these huge comp packages. And then what I'm hearing from a [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1807.84s)]
*  lot of executives is cutting these highly stock comped executives who also have big cash comp, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1813.52s)]
*  cutting them, putting lieutenants in charge, and then moving more jobs to other locations [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1820.8s)]
*  where people don't expect stop stock based comp. You know, if you're in India, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1826.56s)]
*  or you're in South America, whatever, you know, stock based comp is not like the obsession is here. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1830.48s)]
*  So as everybody optimizes these businesses, I mean, Facebook, even why 5000 employees. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1836.0s)]
*  So they announced roughly 500 job cuts out of what 5500 employees. That's crazy. I mean, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1842.3999999999999s)]
*  should that company be operating with 2000 employees? Good question. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1851.2s)]
*  Cut the number of Twitter employees from 8000 to 1500. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1855.6s)]
*  When you look at the number of apps that they're running and the number of products that they're [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1859.12s)]
*  running compared to Metta, right? Metta has far more apps, far more infrastructure. Metta is [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1861.92s)]
*  serving 3.2 billion daily active users. Snap is about 400 million. So Metta is 8x the users [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1866.96s)]
*  with many more applications and much more infrastructure. So I think it's another great [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1875.04s)]
*  kind of ratio to look at the performance of these two. 12 times is maybe. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1881.12s)]
*  I think you're exactly right. Exactly. Yeah. The other advantage that Metta has is because [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1883.92s)]
*  they're so profitable, they have the resources to go big in AI. Big time. Which is very expensive. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1888.96s)]
*  So yeah, so they are the leader. You get all this option value at Metta, which you don't get at [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1894.88s)]
*  Snap. There's all this infrastructure that they can leverage much like Amazon did with AWS into [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1898.72s)]
*  things like cloud, AI tools for third party developers, third party applications. And then [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1904.0s)]
*  obviously Metta is the biggest advertising platform next to Google in the world now. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1910.16s)]
*  And there's much more that they can start to do to extend further into the platforms. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1916.48s)]
*  They did get an awesome save. Remember Apple screwed them and was like, you can track devices [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1921.8400000000001s)]
*  now. And that just took a massive hit in the ad network and it was all those headwinds. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1926.3200000000002s)]
*  They were like, okay, we're just going to use AI to optimize ads. And supposedly the AI [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1931.52s)]
*  optimization of ads, I was talking to somebody on the inside, they said, yeah, we got it all [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1935.68s)]
*  back. We gained it back. We've got massive AI advertising optimization going on. So yeah, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1940.08s)]
*  that's great that Tim Cook kicked us in the nuts, but we don't care. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1945.84s)]
*  By the way, that's a great point, J.Tal. It really says a lot about how Metta was able to [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1949.9199999999998s)]
*  respond to that change, which a lot of people speculated would destroy the advertising business. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1954.72s)]
*  And the fact that they were able to engineer solutions to drive advertising revenue up [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1960.0s)]
*  to $40 billion, it's just mind blowing. It's a really kind of impressive outcome for the team. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1964.24s)]
*  And I think it speaks a lot to the quality of the engineers there. I think it's a great point. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1969.76s)]
*  Sachs, you tweeted that you're seeing a little SaaS bounce back all of a sudden. That's [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1974.0s)]
*  interesting. I am seeing something similar. Last year, last two years, you had a ton of people [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1978.32s)]
*  cutting their SaaS spend, maybe removing the number of SaaS vendors they had, consolidating [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1982.96s)]
*  vendors. You tweeted many public and private software companies are experiencing accelerating [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1989.04s)]
*  growth after six to seven quarters of deceleration. SaaS recession appears to be over according to [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=1992.96s)]
*  the SaaS master, David Sachs. Do you want to pack this for us? What are you saying? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2000.24s)]
*  Well, it's still pretty early because not everyone's reported. But if you looked at [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2004.32s)]
*  the big tech cloud performance in Q4, you could see that there's a bounce back in here. This is [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2008.48s)]
*  NetNew ARR added for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. So you see here in Q4 that there's a huge increase [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2015.2s)]
*  in NetNew ARR for the big cloud computing platforms. And then I think another bellwether [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2024.96s)]
*  is Atlassian. So we're still waiting to hear from HubSpot, Salesforce, Zoom, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2031.2s)]
*  Adobe, companies like that. They haven't reported yet. But if you look at Atlassian- [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2035.8400000000001s)]
*  Atlassian makes Jira amongst other products. They're based in Australia. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2039.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2042.88s)]
*  Collection of SaaS companies, right? It's a collection of SaaS products. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2044.72s)]
*  Yeah. So NetNew ARR would be the amount of growth in that quarter. And this is on a year [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2048.0s)]
*  over year basis. You can kind of see Q4 of 21 was the absolute peak. And then plummeted. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2054.8s)]
*  And then it actually went negative for about a year. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2063.28s)]
*  That's tough to be in a company with NetNew ARR going negative. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2066.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. That doesn't mean, by the way, the company's shrinking. It just means that the amount [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2070.88s)]
*  of NetNew ARR, which is the amount of growth, is actually smaller than that same quarter [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2075.52s)]
*  year before. And then in Q4, you could see there's some acceleration here. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2082.08s)]
*  They added more NetNew ARR, I guess 33% more in Q4 than they did over the previous year. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2089.12s)]
*  And part of that, Sax, is because the comps are lower and they kind of bottomed out. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2095.36s)]
*  Yeah. They bottomed out. Now they're re-accelerating. So we're starting to see this in some of my board [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2099.52s)]
*  meetings as well, where in 2022, everybody was missing their numbers and re-forecasting down. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2105.04s)]
*  And then they would miss the re-forecast. So by 2023, the forecasts were very, very conservative. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2111.68s)]
*  And I would say, now I'm seeing companies beat the lower forecasts in Q4. This wasn't happening [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2118.72s)]
*  earlier in the year. But finally, I think people are starting to beat their lower forecast for Q4. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2127.6s)]
*  That's the question that I was curious about. What do you actually think is happening? Is that [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2133.52s)]
*  we've re-baselined these businesses. So now what would have looked like just a massive miss over [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2138.24s)]
*  the last two years now looks like a beat because we've just completely reset expectations. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2144.24s)]
*  Is it that? Or is it that the economy is actually expanding and we can count on [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2149.2799999999997s)]
*  some reasonable growth rates? Is it a combo of the two? What do you think it actually is? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2156.64s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's definitely a new baseline in the sense that, and if you go back to 2020 or 2021, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2161.36s)]
*  we considered good growth to be 2 to 3x year over year. And now if it's going from 60 to 80% growth [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2169.28s)]
*  year over year, you're happy. So there's definitely been a lowering of expectations. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2177.12s)]
*  That being said, you still see in these numbers, there has been a bottoming out and [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2181.6s)]
*  we're starting to not grow from this new baseline. So for example, I think with Atlassian here, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2186.0s)]
*  we are seeing an increase in spend basically in growth. So the way a recession is typically [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2194.72s)]
*  defined is two quarters of negative growth. We had six to seven quarters of decelerating [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2200.56s)]
*  or negative growth. In SaaS, in tech. In SaaS, which is why I called it the SaaS depression. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2206.96s)]
*  Yeah, it was actually kind of a depression, you're right. But now we're seeing quarter over [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2214.32s)]
*  quarter growth. So growth is reaccelerating. Growth is higher than it was. So is it going to get to [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2218.32s)]
*  where it was? That probably will take some time, but it feels like the problems in the ecosystem [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2224.0s)]
*  work themselves out and now we're back to growth again. Yeah, I can add psychologically because [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2229.44s)]
*  I'm in a couple of SaaS boards as well. And psychologically, it felt like, you tell me if [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2233.92s)]
*  I'm right, Saks, if you saw the same thing, there were two years of calling up customers [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2238.2400000000002s)]
*  and they were like, we're consolidating vendors. And by the way, we did a riff. And so we need 20% [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2242.8s)]
*  less seats. So we're going to have 20% less SaaS companies that we're buying from, and we're going [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2247.92s)]
*  to have 20% less seats. So you start putting that all together. Man, everybody was just in [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2254.0800000000004s)]
*  psychological triage mode. We cannot spend money. I don't want to lose my job. So you're if you're [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2259.2000000000003s)]
*  a procurement person, you're the CTO, you don't want to lose your job. You don't want to have more [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2264.32s)]
*  cuts. So you're like, well, I can cut some software costs. Do I get points for that? And the points [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2267.6800000000003s)]
*  you would score for the last two years was cutting costs. But the market ripping. And you [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2272.32s)]
*  now got a really, you know, efficient company, you're like, hey, can we spend a little bit on [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2278.48s)]
*  SaaS to make the remaining employees even more, you know, productive? Okay, maybe that's a reasonable [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2282.32s)]
*  discussion. And then people are playing ball in terms of negotiating prices. So that's the other [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2288.48s)]
*  thing I see is like, people are like, we'll take your software, but here's what we want to pay. And [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2293.36s)]
*  then they're coming to the board and saying, can we do this deal? Would have been a million dollar [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2296.88s)]
*  deal, but it's a $200,000. Yeah, take the money. Take the money. Let's let's bear hug that customer. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2300.72s)]
*  The market is generally an escalator on the way up an elevator on the way down. So the recovery is [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2305.9199999999996s)]
*  going to take a long time. But at least we bottomed out and we're in recovery as opposed to continuing [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2310.8799999999997s)]
*  declines. Yeah, by the same token, if you're a startup, and you're not seeing improvement [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2316.56s)]
*  in your Q4 sales, then you no longer have a macro excuse for why you're not doing well. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2321.52s)]
*  Interesting. And then Freeberg, you added, you know, you're like, I'll make my own software, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2328.32s)]
*  you said, you know, some SaaS software is too expensive. I'll put a developer on it. And so [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2333.28s)]
*  how's that working out for you? Are you still in that mindset of like, yeah, maybe we just build [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2338.7200000000003s)]
*  our own software? Yeah, I mean, I, it's not just us. I think we're seeing a lot of companies pursuing [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2342.4s)]
*  this path, a couple engineers can rebuild the functionality of core applications, particularly [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2348.88s)]
*  because I think if you think about the business model that makes SaaS so great, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2354.64s)]
*  is they could value share, rather than charge the cost of an engineer plus some margin, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2359.2799999999997s)]
*  the great business model, the equity value that comes in software, is you can build something [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2365.92s)]
*  once that creates $100 of value, you can probably charge your customer 30 $40 for that product, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2370.7999999999997s)]
*  because it's saving them 60 bucks, 70 bucks, and they'll make that switch to software. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2376.72s)]
*  So, you know, the ROI driven value share model in SaaS has made it incredibly valuable. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2381.2s)]
*  The problem now is that an engineer can be hired to build the replacement. And so it creates price [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2388.0s)]
*  compression. So the SaaS company can no longer capture that much value, because the savings is [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2395.04s)]
*  actually less than that. Because the enterprise might say, hey, I'm going to hire someone and [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2400.32s)]
*  instead of spending 60 grand a year on your software, I'm going to allocate a quarter of an [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2404.48s)]
*  engineer's time to build that software, and it's going to replace that. That cost. So I think that [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2409.04s)]
*  that's still the case. So while there might be bookings, there's still which are driven largely [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2413.36s)]
*  by a search for efficiency gains a search for more profitability for more productivity within [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2418.72s)]
*  an enterprise. There are other options for that enterprise to realize that productivity gain today. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2423.68s)]
*  And that's what's going to cause perhaps price compression and more competition than has been [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2428.88s)]
*  the case. But I don't think that the adoption of software is going to slow down. It certainly [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2434.48s)]
*  seems to be re accelerating, which is great. We're moving into a hyper competitive market, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2439.28s)]
*  right? Especially with AI. It's a mix of internal software. It's a mix of internal software. As you [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2444.88s)]
*  guys know, there are very few traditional non tech enterprises now that don't have a software team [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2449.6s)]
*  that can write code. Now that so many companies have software teams that write code, they're all [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2454.4s)]
*  going to be asking the question, should we be buying the software? Or should we be building [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2459.2s)]
*  something internal? Yep. It's a classic buyer build situation. All right. Let's talk a little [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2462.8s)]
*  bit about VCs and how they're investing in AI. There seems to be three camps shaping up here, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2467.1200000000003s)]
*  Chema. You know, one group is like, the incumbents are going to win, you know, Microsoft, Google, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2471.36s)]
*  Amazon, everybody, they're going to win the day. So they're going to wait and see. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2476.8s)]
*  Then there's another group who's sitting it out because they're like, hey, open source is going [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2481.92s)]
*  to win. Metas committed to open source and collaborative platforms. I've been playing with [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2485.44s)]
*  hugging face with Sandeep as well as you, Chema, and it's pretty amazing what's happening over [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2491.76s)]
*  there. And then a bunch are obviously placing bets right now. The valuations are absurd. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2497.1200000000003s)]
*  Founders Fund and Andreessen Horowitz, two notable firms, are approaching it differently. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2502.2400000000002s)]
*  Founders Fund bought into OpenAI at a $29 billion valuation. But aside from that investment, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2506.8s)]
*  they're generally avoiding the AI deals. On the other hand, Andreessen is betting heavily. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2513.0400000000004s)]
*  Character AI, Replet, Eleven Labs, Mishra, you're also in Replet, Saks. So what do you think? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2518.24s)]
*  Is open source going to win the day? You've been picks and shovels the whole way. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2525.12s)]
*  You've been talking about compression. Maybe this isn't actually a good market. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2528.72s)]
*  What's your thinking as a capital allocator, Chema? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2532.8799999999997s)]
*  I think foundational models will have no economic value. I think that they will be [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2534.8799999999997s)]
*  an incredibly powerful part of the substrate, and they will be broadly available and entirely free. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2540.24s)]
*  If you think about that, any closed model, especially a closed model that operates on [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2548.6400000000003s)]
*  the open internet, is not very valuable. And any open source model that trains on the open internet [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2554.88s)]
*  will make that so. In that world, things like Mistral and Lama will essentially decay the [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2564.1600000000003s)]
*  market to zero. So if you're looking at any economic value that has been captured up until [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2572.4s)]
*  today, if it has been captured by having a proprietary closed model trained on open data, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2578.2400000000002s)]
*  that economic value will go away. And I think Google and Microsoft and Facebook and Amazon [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2586.8s)]
*  and all these startups have a deep economic incentive actually to make that so. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2594.1600000000003s)]
*  So now you can evaluate what that means. So if you get an open model from Hugging Face, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2599.52s)]
*  that's just kick-ass. Where do you spend money? Well, you're going to have to spend money to [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2605.36s)]
*  actually train it, to fine tune it, maybe to have some pretty zippy inference. And all of that means [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2610.8s)]
*  that there's a new kind of substrate that has to be built, which is all around the way that the [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2619.6000000000004s)]
*  tokens per second are provisioned to the apps that sit on top of the model. What that means is [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2624.64s)]
*  you need to go back to 2006 and 2007 and say, okay, when we first created the cloud, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2630.64s)]
*  who made money? And fast forward 18 years later, it's the same people that are still making money. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2636.16s)]
*  So the people that made money in 2006 and 2007 were Amazon principally, because of EC2 and S3. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2642.7999999999997s)]
*  The perfect analogy of EC2 and S3 in 2024 is the token per second provider. Now, there you have to [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2649.92s)]
*  double click and say, okay, well, what does a token per second provider need to do to make a lot of [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2658.2400000000002s)]
*  money? And I think the ultimate answer is you need your own proprietary hardware. So who is in a [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2662.56s)]
*  position to do that? Amazon has announced that they have an inference and training solution. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2667.44s)]
*  For training, Cerebris has announced a pretty compelling solution. Google obviously has TPU, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2673.6800000000003s)]
*  then there's a handful of startups, including one that I helped get off the ground in 2016, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2679.04s)]
*  that I funded called Grok. All of those companies are in a position to build a tokens per second [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2683.04s)]
*  service. Then you have companies like Together AI, which basically just go and take venture money [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2689.36s)]
*  and wrap Nvidia GPUs. And you can debate what the advantage will be there. One could say, well, it's [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2694.8s)]
*  not really a huge advantage over time. So my refined thoughts today are sort of what my initial [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2703.76s)]
*  guess was, when we started talking about AI a year ago, which is the picks and shovels providers can [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2710.1600000000003s)]
*  make a ton of money. And the people that own proprietary data can make a ton of money. But I [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2716.5600000000004s)]
*  think open source models will basically crush the value of models to zero economically, even though [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2722.7200000000003s)]
*  the utility will go to infinity, the economic value will go to zero. And so I think that's [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2728.0800000000004s)]
*  the way that the economic value will go to zero. Did any of you guys see Chamath's interview with [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2733.12s)]
*  Jonathan Ross? No, not yet. You put it out, right? Chamath, you made it public. You know, I did it [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2736.72s)]
*  just for my subscribers. But Jonathan is the founder and CEO of Grok, the company that I just [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2742.48s)]
*  mentioned. And the quick version of that story is I would pour over the Google earnings results [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2747.52s)]
*  in the mid teens of 2000, because I was pretty actively investing in a bunch of different [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2754.7999999999997s)]
*  public equities. And Sundar said in a press release, he mentioned that they had rolled their own [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2759.2s)]
*  silicon for machine learning called TPU. And I was like, what is going on that Google thinks that [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2763.8399999999997s)]
*  they can actually roll their own silicon? What must they know that the rest of us don't know? [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2771.6s)]
*  And so it took me about six or nine months, but through Sunny, I got introduced to Jonathan. And [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2777.2s)]
*  then we were able to get Jonathan to leave Google. And he started and he Jonathan was the founder of [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2782.48s)]
*  TPU at Google. And then he started Grok, which I was able to lead that funding round in 2016. So [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2787.68s)]
*  eight years ago. Anyways, I did a spaces with Jonathan talking about the entire AI landscape [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2795.3599999999997s)]
*  and AI acceleration to my subscribers, but it was so good. I got to say he is he was so impressive [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2801.9199999999996s)]
*  that we kind of like figured out a way to just play the space and tape it and then we published [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2810.24s)]
*  it to everybody. So it's on it's on my Twitter for anybody that wants to listen to it. It is [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2817.36s)]
*  amazing. He is really impressive. I was sitting on the 17 going to Santa Cruz, not moving for [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2822.1600000000003s)]
*  hour and a half and I listened to it. So I kept me alive, but I thought it was really great. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2830.6400000000003s)]
*  He's great, no, he's great. Some great insights. And I think he's very compelling in arguing why [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2836.2400000000002s)]
*  some of the big cloud providers today that are offering infrastructure for AI [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2844.32s)]
*  model training and inference are going to be challenged if someone can build full stack [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2850.7200000000003s)]
*  and do it successfully. So it was a really good interview. I actually think it's really worth [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2857.12s)]
*  listening to, but I enjoyed it. Yeah. Thanks for putting it out there. I was like literally just [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2862.08s)]
*  sitting, I was sitting in the car browsing Twitter and I saw your thing and I clicked on it and I [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2867.2000000000003s)]
*  just ended up listening to the whole thing. It's a little hard actually when you do a space for your [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2871.12s)]
*  subs, you can't actually just flip a switch and then release it to all of your followers. So we [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2875.8399999999997s)]
*  actually had to like literally play it and then just capture the audio out and then republish it. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2882.64s)]
*  But anyways, despite that inconvenience, if anybody's interested in learning about AI hardware, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2888.56s)]
*  he is very compelling and he's very educational. So Saks, your thoughts on just how you're [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2893.44s)]
*  approaching investing in AI, if you're specifically investing in the underpinnings of AI, picks and [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2898.64s)]
*  shovels, yada yada, or if you're just looking on the application level and it's that kind of approach. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2904.16s)]
*  Well, we divided the space into three categories. One is the models themselves, the foundation [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2910.48s)]
*  models, which can be either open source or closed source. There's infrastructure. So like Jamal's [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2916.16s)]
*  saying it could be like model training. It could be vector databases, tools that developers use [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2923.12s)]
*  to create the AI stack typically inside their enterprise. And then the third would be applications, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2930.24s)]
*  which can be things like co-pilots, or it could be a pre-AI app that's using AI to kind of turbo charge [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2935.7599999999998s)]
*  its capabilities. Most Saks would be in the application bucket. And so that's principally [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2943.44s)]
*  where we're focused, although we do look at infrastructure plays and models. However, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2949.76s)]
*  I do think there is an argument for, I mean, really with the question of commoditization, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2954.88s)]
*  well, like all the model companies just get totally commoditized. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2960.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, really we're talking about open AI, right? Because they're the leader. So the question is, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2964.1600000000003s)]
*  can they maintain their lead? I do think there is an argument that open AI will [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2967.6000000000004s)]
*  stay in the lead and actually do quite well. And I think there's a few points there. One is [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2974.24s)]
*  that if you're a consumer, you just want to use the best GPT. You want to use Google. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2980.88s)]
*  It's just like search, right? If Google is a little better, or the perception is, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2986.0s)]
*  it's a little better than Bing or the other search engines. You don't win a plurality of [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2990.48s)]
*  search traffic. You actually end up winning it all because consumers just want the very best one. So [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=2995.84s)]
*  so most of the tests show that open AI is still ahead of the open source models. And I think even [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3000.7200000000003s)]
*  people in the open source movement will tell you that open AI is called six months ahead. They have [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3006.96s)]
*  no doubt that open source will get to where open AI is now in six months. Nonetheless, if open AI [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3012.32s)]
*  just maintains a little bit of a lead over open source, then it could compound. It can basically [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3019.12s)]
*  win the vast, vast majority of the call it consumer search or consumer GPT market. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3027.2s)]
*  So that's point number one. Point number two is now that open AI has these hundreds of millions [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3032.8799999999997s)]
*  of consumers using it, that's a pretty attractive audience for developers to want to reach. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3040.0s)]
*  And open AI has done a really good job creating a platform for developers to create what are called [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3046.48s)]
*  custom GPTs. So most developers don't want to go through the hassle of training a model, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3052.8s)]
*  fine tuning a model, doing all of that work that you would have to do in the open source ecosystem. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3060.48s)]
*  They just want to point chat GPT at a repository of data or documents, information, have it learn [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3064.88s)]
*  what it needs to learn, fine tune it in that way, maybe add some lightweight functionality using [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3074.96s)]
*  open AI's platform to create a custom GPT. That's what I think most developers want is they just want [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3079.84s)]
*  a simple stack to work with. And they're going to prize again, simplicity and the power of the [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3086.32s)]
*  developer tools over the theoretical control they get by rolling their own models, training and [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3092.4s)]
*  fine tuning their own models in open source. And so I think what you're seeing now is, I mean, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3098.32s)]
*  how many custom GPTs have already been created on the open AI platform? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3103.04s)]
*  I mean, thousands. It might be tens of thousands. I mean, there's so easy to create. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3105.76s)]
*  Maybe even millions. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3108.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's so easy to create them. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3109.04s)]
*  So you have a classic developer network effect where you've got open AI aggregating hundreds [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3110.88s)]
*  of millions of consumers because they perceive that chat GPT is the best. Then you've got [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3115.6s)]
*  developers wanting to reach that audience. So they build custom GPTs on the open AI platform. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3120.4s)]
*  That actually gives chat GPT more capability. And that's something that open source can easily [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3126.24s)]
*  catch up with. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3131.68s)]
*  Well, actually, actually, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3132.32s)]
*  just to finish the point. So yeah, so it is a flywheel where, you know, classic operating system [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3135.12s)]
*  developer network effect where you want to use the operating system that is the most [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3141.2799999999997s)]
*  programs written for it. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3145.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And interestingly, hugging face has realized this and hugging face released this week, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3147.36s)]
*  their own version of GPTs, which is really interesting. And you can pick SACS, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3153.04s)]
*  which open source project you want to use to make it. So unlike GPTs on chat GPT, we have to pick [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3157.92s)]
*  theirs on the hugging face one, you could pick, you know, llama or whichever one you want. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3162.96s)]
*  There's an account called artificial analysis that you can follow. The thing to keep in mind, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3168.96s)]
*  SACS is that for any of this to be true, these API's need to be usable, right? I mean, I don't [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3174.2400000000002s)]
*  know if you remember, but when we were building apps, even as back as the late 2000s and early [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3179.36s)]
*  2010s, one of the things was there was a pretty important paper that was published by Google [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3185.68s)]
*  about attention span. And it would look at page load times in a cold cache environment, right? [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3190.08s)]
*  And it basically said you have to be at like 150 milliseconds, right? That's like [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3196.4s)]
*  best in class performance or faster. And I remember when we read that at Facebook, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3201.44s)]
*  we went crazy. So much so that at one point, a small team and I kind of actually launched a [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3205.2799999999997s)]
*  stripped down version of Facebook to compete with Facebook. If there's a Nick, you can probably [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3211.2799999999997s)]
*  find this article on TechCrunch. And we did it without telling him he was called like Facebook [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3215.36s)]
*  zero. Anyways, the point is speed matters. Because in the absence of having very snappy response, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3218.96s)]
*  you could have the best model in the world. But if it takes 10, 20, 30 seconds to basically [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3225.36s)]
*  initiate and get back data from a fetch request, it's an impossible thing to do. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3230.8s)]
*  So I think one of the things that you have to keep in mind is that there are these two things [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3236.32s)]
*  that need to move at the same time. One is the quality of how the model is, but two is [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3239.76s)]
*  the speed and its responsiveness, which is a function of, again, hardware and your ability [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3243.76s)]
*  to basically tokenize tokens per second very, very quickly, so that developers are incentivized [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3248.64s)]
*  to not just play around in a sandbox, but to actually build production code. And I don't [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3254.08s)]
*  think we've seen that second thing happen because nobody is delivering it. And that's the big thing [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3259.04s)]
*  that nobody talks about. For example, like AWS, if you look inside of how expensive it is to build [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3262.96s)]
*  an app there, I've tried, even when they give you credits, the credits they give you aren't sufficient [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3268.24s)]
*  enough to even pay for half the power. And then the way that they schedule and the way that they [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3273.44s)]
*  try to orchestrate you to use hardware makes building production apps, unless you are willing [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3278.8s)]
*  to spend millions and millions of dollars for a very slow app, unfeasible. And so if you go back [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3283.92s)]
*  to a startup economy raising money here, the venture investor should start asking the question, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3290.08s)]
*  well, what is the speed and usability of these services that I'm funding? And the reason is [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3297.28s)]
*  because you could build the best experience in the world that runs on local host. But if all of a [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3302.72s)]
*  sudden you actually try to launch it as an app, and the thing takes 35 and 40 seconds to generate [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3307.3599999999997s)]
*  something, it's DOA. And I don't think enough people ask those questions or understand that [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3312.16s)]
*  that's true. So this is why I think you have to sort of be looking at both of these two things [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3317.4399999999996s)]
*  at the same time. But this account is interesting because it kind of just strips things down to the [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3322.24s)]
*  bare facts. And they start to allow you as a third party to understand what you can do. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3328.8s)]
*  Yeah, speed is just such a critical component of this. And what Google found was, as you know, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3336.48s)]
*  free brokers, you were there. Every time they lowered a certain number of milliseconds, the [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3341.6800000000003s)]
*  usage went up, right? People did more searches, which makes sense if you get your results back [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3345.6000000000004s)]
*  faster. Yeah, it was a key metric from day one at Google Marissa Mayer. She ran all the consumer [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3349.28s)]
*  facing products at Google during this earlier era. She was like, beat it into the team. I mean, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3355.92s)]
*  if you guys remember, one of the first kind of early feature of the Google results page was the [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3362.08s)]
*  amount of time it took to load the results. They'd show you how many milliseconds it took. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3368.16s)]
*  Show you that. Yeah, they literally put your North Star metric exposed to the consumer, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3371.28s)]
*  which that must have lit a fire under the asses of all the developers and server people. Yeah. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3375.6s)]
*  Well, I mean, they were kind of showing off the quality of the infrastructure and the way they [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3379.76s)]
*  did indexing and everything, but the result really played out in usage. The faster the results, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3383.04s)]
*  the more frequently you would use the search engine and the more likely you were to come back. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3388.88s)]
*  And it's amazing how much consumer behavior drifts based on milliseconds. Like you have a few [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3392.88s)]
*  milliseconds of the way. Yeah, McDonald's learned this, right? I mean, if you look at the, if you [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3399.36s)]
*  ever see the movie, The Founder, where they explain the McDonald's process, they learned it too. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3402.8s)]
*  Guys, look at this. This is really interesting on this analysis. I mean, Chamath, are you saying [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3406.72s)]
*  that you don't think OpenAI can achieve the necessary levels of performance? [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3410.56s)]
*  No, I'm saying two things. OpenAI is three different businesses. OpenAI has a closed model [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3414.88s)]
*  that's trained on the open internet. I think economically, it's going to be very hard to [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3419.84s)]
*  sustain that unless they start buying all number of apps so that they can get some fine tunes that [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3423.84s)]
*  they control that are proprietary to them. So for example, if OpenAI were to buy all of Reddit, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3430.08s)]
*  that would be a really interesting development that would improve the quality of OpenAI [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3435.2s)]
*  in a unique and differentiated way relative to where things like Llama and Mistral will get to [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3440.32s)]
*  at the same time, as well as X is Grok. I think they're all going to converge [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3445.92s)]
*  to the same quality in the next probably 12 to 18 months. That's point number one. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3450.7200000000003s)]
*  Your belief there is there's enough data in those pools that everybody reaches parity. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3455.76s)]
*  No, did you guys, okay, Nick, did you, so I published this primer on AI. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3460.4s)]
*  There is a slide in there, Nick, that you can pull out, but it just shows you [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3465.12s)]
*  that there is a converging in the quality of the results as the number of the parameters of the [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3470.24s)]
*  model gets higher and higher. And what it effectively shows you is that we are already in the land [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3476.96s)]
*  of diminishing returns when models are trained on the same underlying data. So if you are using the [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3482.24s)]
*  open internet, Llama, Mistral, OpenAI, they're all getting to the same quality code point, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3488.56s)]
*  and they will be there within the next six to nine months. So that's business number one on [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3494.88s)]
*  OpenAI. Business number two is a consumer facing app called ChatGPT. That has a lot of legs because [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3499.12s)]
*  I think people are, you know, develop habits, it'll be very sticky, and I think it'll get better and [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3505.2799999999997s)]
*  better. And then the third business that they're in is selling enterprise services to large Fortune [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3510.16s)]
*  500s. In fact, if you look at their OpenAI data, what they talk about is they sell, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3517.12s)]
*  they've sold already to like 94% of the Fortune 500. What does that mean? I think what that [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3521.12s)]
*  actually means is they've sold a lot of test environments and sandboxing. But again, in order [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3526.16s)]
*  to translate that into functional production code that's used by Bank of America, right, or Boeing, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3531.2s)]
*  in production, you have to have zippy, zippy fast SLAs and a level of performance that no [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3537.7599999999998s)]
*  cloud provider yet has delivered. None, nobody. So Nick, if you just go to that, please the thing, [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3546.48s)]
*  I just wanted to show you this because it's really interesting chart. This is not mine. This is [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3552.96s)]
*  theirs. If you look at quality versus price tax, it starts to show you like, where do you want to be? [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3555.92s)]
*  You want to be in the upper left quadrant in their analysis, right? And so the point is, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3562.4s)]
*  what you can see is that a ton of different models are getting to this same place. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3570.08s)]
*  And so obviously, you'd want to use the model that's the cheapest, or most convenient. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3574.0s)]
*  Well, who's going to pay for that? If you and your LPs want to pay for that, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3579.12s)]
*  the person that figures out the way that it's the cheapest to give you the same answer will [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3584.72s)]
*  actually end up winning because you will run out of money and they will not. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3588.48s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, I think that there's a lot of business problems inside companies where [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3592.72s)]
*  people just want to very quickly set up their own, again, custom GPT without having to go through [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3598.2400000000002s)]
*  the time, the cost, the hassle of trying to do model training or fine tuning. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3606.6400000000003s)]
*  So let's just back up. Here's the path that OpenAI is on. So step one, get hundreds of millions of [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3611.04s)]
*  consumers using it and getting them to view OpenAI or chat GPT as the Google in this area, right? [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3617.6s)]
*  Strong presumption. This is just the one you go to when you have a question. Step two, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3625.2s)]
*  these same people, these same consumers now want to use chat GPT at work because there's some [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3632.8799999999997s)]
*  research they want to do. So OpenAI has just rolled out both enterprise licenses and team [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3638.48s)]
*  workspaces. So you can work collaboratively on the same queries in a team workspace. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3644.64s)]
*  Step three is rolling out a very easy to use dev platform that allows developers to, again, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3649.68s)]
*  create custom GPTs by just pointing OpenAI at repositories. And so let's say that you're the [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3655.92s)]
*  customer support team and you want to create a GPT to help customer support answer cases. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3664.88s)]
*  You could basically then train chat GPT on, let's say, every customer support ticket and email [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3673.76s)]
*  that the company has ever produced, right? Now you could wait for the company's IT department [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3686.0s)]
*  to get its act together and figure out how to train an open source model on the same thing. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3691.84s)]
*  But do you really want to wait for that or do you just want to get going? [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3697.92s)]
*  And now OpenAI has given you the enterprise license that you need to pacify the concerns [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3701.12s)]
*  about security and privacy and all that kind of things. To some degree, there's always going to [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3708.7999999999997s)]
*  be those super paranoid Fortune 500 companies that will insist on owning everything and doing [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3712.7999999999997s)]
*  it open source. Let me build on your example. So I run a small software company during the day [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3720.24s)]
*  called Hustle. And we saw a lot of tickets related to this specific legislation that exists [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3725.76s)]
*  whenever you're texting or you're doing auto dialing stuff called 10 DLC. And so we wanted to [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3734.8s)]
*  eliminate those tickets, right? So I actually went and I built a GPT, which was called the Privacy [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3742.7200000000003s)]
*  Policy Generator, because a lot of these trouble tickets were because the privacy policies are bad. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3749.36s)]
*  And we train them using a handful of ones that were good and a handful of ones that are bad with [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3754.3199999999997s)]
*  a bunch of rules. And I train them on and it's wonderful, except I can't run it in production, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3760.3199999999997s)]
*  because it's not the kind of thing that is usable in that way. Right now, it's still very difficult. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3766.64s)]
*  And so all I'm saying is, I'm happy to keep spending a few hundred dollars a month, a few [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3773.2s)]
*  thousand bucks a month, whatever it is that I'm spending, I don't quite exactly know. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3778.0s)]
*  And I agree with you, it was very easy. I think OpenAI does an excellent job of getting off the [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3781.76s)]
*  ground. But what I'm also saying is that when you actually translate that into a mainline use case, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3788.1600000000003s)]
*  where I want to now give it to my support team and say, this is now a tool you can rely on, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3796.2400000000002s)]
*  it's integrated into your workflow, into your other tools, it's integrated into how you [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3801.2000000000003s)]
*  pipe out data into Salesforce or what have you. It's just very hard. And I'm not saying it's not [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3805.68s)]
*  going to get fixed. I'm saying we're just not there yet. And one of the ways in which it's not there [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3811.44s)]
*  is that there is no place I can go, including OpenAI, that actually makes it fast enough to [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3817.2s)]
*  be usable in production. You wrote this on OpenAI stack, you wrote a custom GPT? Yeah, built myself. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3822.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you can do the monohugging face now, it's gonna be a lot of options. In terms of [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3829.7599999999998s)]
*  integrating into your workflows, I think it's a really interesting point because I saw [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3833.76s)]
*  a demo somewhere where now, actually, I think OpenAI announced this, that you can at mention [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3838.1600000000003s)]
*  a custom GPT. Yeah, yeah, Sonny showed me that this week on the Pondoon. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3844.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, in chat GPT, you can now mention a custom GPT to kind of invoke it. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3848.96s)]
*  Yeah, so how it works is you would say, hey, I'm heading to New York, what flights [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3854.1600000000003s)]
*  can I get at Expedia, at kayak, whatever, and then it gives you, you know, the results here, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3857.84s)]
*  and you're kind of pulling that up. Just to the point about, about where data advantages lie, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3864.7200000000003s)]
*  and that's ultimately going to drive value. I cannot, I've tried to think a lot about this, [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3869.92s)]
*  I cannot think about a better data advantage that is orders of magnitude better than anything else. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3876.1600000000003s)]
*  Say YouTube, say YouTube. Yeah, it is. So here's, here's the numbers. I pulled this up. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3884.64s)]
*  You guys know, like GPT three and three and a half were trained with a heavy weighting on common [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3891.92s)]
*  crawl, which is this open source. Yeah, we talked about this before Gil Elbaz runs it open source [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3896.3199999999997s)]
*  crawling of the web, the total amount of data in common crawl, which I think accounted, [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3902.24s)]
*  and I could be off on this something like 40 to 60% of the weighting in GPT three or three, [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3906.7999999999997s)]
*  five, I'm off on this probably. So the total amount of data in that common crawl data set is [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3911.92s)]
*  about 10 petabytes. Okay. Based on YouTube's public statement recently, they're seeing about [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3915.84s)]
*  500 hours a minute of video uploaded or 720,000 hours a day. And if you assume somewhere between, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3924.4s)]
*  you know, just under 10 ADP on that video, we're talking about probably one to two petabytes of [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3931.52s)]
*  data being uploaded to YouTube per day. So if you assume like over time, the definition of the [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3938.64s)]
*  video's gone, gotten better and the amount of uploads gotten up, you could probably assume [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3945.52s)]
*  that there's roughly, I'm guessing there's probably somewhere between 2000 and 3000 petabytes of data [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3950.16s)]
*  in YouTube growing by one to two petabytes per day, which makes YouTube's data repository [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3957.68s)]
*  300 times larger than common crawl, which makes it bigger than anything else that anyone else has. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3964.56s)]
*  And here's the amazing thing about it. It has video, it has image, it has audio, it has text, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3970.56s)]
*  it has everything. And it is growing. So if you were to take a bet or build a thesis around this [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3977.52s)]
*  point that the data advantage is going to drive value creation, if Google gets its act together [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3984.32s)]
*  and leverages the data repository at YouTube, it is an insurmountable moat that will only continue [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3988.88s)]
*  to extend because the quality of the YouTube experience and the network effects continue to [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3995.04s)]
*  accumulate for them. So I think it's the most valuable asset in the world today, based on this [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=3999.52s)]
*  thesis, that AI value is going to accrue to the data owner. I think you're making such an important [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4004.4s)]
*  point. This is why the counterfactual is is true. And it's actually showing up in the data. And Nick [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4009.2000000000003s)]
*  will show you this slide again from from the AI primer. But that is why we're seeing these [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4015.92s)]
*  diminishing returns for your book and all of these third party benchmarks of these models. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4020.0s)]
*  Using the same data sets. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4023.36s)]
*  It's all using the same data set. So what we are proving is not that the underlying hardware can't [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4024.32s)]
*  scale nor that transformers are only efficient to a point. That's not what all of this convergence [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4029.76s)]
*  is showing. It's that in the absence of proprietary data, you're just going to get to the same model [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4034.6400000000003s)]
*  quality. And we're seeing a bunch of different models get to a very early finish line, which, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4039.04s)]
*  again, if people like Facebook are doing for free, that's much easier to underwrite, [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4045.52s)]
*  because you don't have to underwrite it, a differentiator in five years. But if you have [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4050.4s)]
*  a if you have a startup with equity value tied to a model, I think it's very it's much more of a [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4056.88s)]
*  tenuous place to be in the absence of proprietary data. And everyone in the world has a camera and [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4063.1200000000003s)]
*  a microphone in their pocket, and high speed internet now from the phone in their pocket. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4069.04s)]
*  And more and more people are uploading that content that that data that's being generated. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4074.48s)]
*  YouTube's got this free data vacuum, and they're just out in the world. And most of it's getting [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4079.12s)]
*  up. Well, it is public facing, though. So it's not just true for text. It's also true for, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4083.6s)]
*  you know, all of the image generation. So they can train more than just an LLM on it, right? They [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4090.32s)]
*  can build all sorts of Yeah, go ahead. No, no, no, I was just gonna say like the version of common [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4095.12s)]
*  crawl for training these image models also exists. And so to your point, it's like, we are all [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4100.48s)]
*  operating from the same brittle, very fixed small quantum of training information. And so that is [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4105.919999999999s)]
*  why I think like Facebook and Google are doing a really important job by deciding that these [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4113.919999999999s)]
*  models should be free, right? And then being able to the so then the question that just accentuates [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4120.799999999999s)]
*  their data advantage. It does. And I think that it allows them to decide how much to leak out. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4127.12s)]
*  So for example, whenever like, if you were using a lot of Google services like GFS, Bigtable, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4134.24s)]
*  BigQuery, you know, TensorFlow, the versions that you had access to via GCP was always one or two [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4139.84s)]
*  generations behind what the Google employees got to use, right. But it was still so much better [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4148.24s)]
*  than anything else that we could get anywhere else that you would still build to those endpoints. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4154.48s)]
*  And I think there's a similar version of this where Facebook and Google probably realize like, [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4158.799999999999s)]
*  look, we'll have version five running internally to optimize ads and all of this other stuff that [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4162.879999999999s)]
*  makes our business that much better. And we'll expose version three to the public. But version [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4169.12s)]
*  three is still trained on so much proprietary data that it's so much better than version 10 and [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4173.759999999999s)]
*  anything else that's just operating on the open internet. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4178.5599999999995s)]
*  And, you know, to your point, Freiburg, that's the outward facing stuff. YouTube is a collection [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4181.839999999999s)]
*  of things people want to share. What Google also has is Google Docs and Gmail, things that people [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4187.04s)]
*  say privately. So they have another data resource there that they can tap, you know, and there'll [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4193.679999999999s)]
*  be regulations and privacy around that. But maybe there's a difference there. But I honestly can't [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4199.36s)]
*  think of the quantum coming close to YouTube, not even close. Well, the thing to Jason's point, [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4203.44s)]
*  which is really interesting is like, you know, there's a modality in AI called rag, where you [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4208.879999999999s)]
*  can actually just augment with very specific training on a very specific subset of documents [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4213.44s)]
*  to improve. It's like a it's like a hacked version of a fine tune. But the beautiful thing about that [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4219.44s)]
*  is like, if you have a Google workspace, my entire company runs on on Google workspace. In fact, [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4224.16s)]
*  most of my companies do at this point, to click a button, where all of a sudden now, [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4229.36s)]
*  all of that stuff in all of my G drives all of a sudden is trainable, so that the n plus first [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4234.96s)]
*  employee comes in and has an agent that's tuned on every deck, every model, spreadsheet, every [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4241.28s)]
*  document. That's a huge edge. Huge, huge edge, by the way, and as a CEO, if you gave me that choice, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4247.599999999999s)]
*  I don't think anybody underneath that reports to me has any right to make that decision. But as a [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4254.64s)]
*  CEO, I would click that button instantly. And I had that right as a CEO. And so like, that's the [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4259.76s)]
*  CEO pitch. It's like, look, I can just give you these agents that are that are like, the next [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4264.08s)]
*  version of a knowledge base that we've always wanted inside of a company. Right? Notion has this, [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4269.76s)]
*  you know, they've basically you can start asking your entire notion instance questions about [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4275.280000000001s)]
*  notion, which is incredible. And, yeah, you can just add as a CEO, you can see across everything [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4280.32s)]
*  Chema, because as you know, with Google Docs, if you're in a compliance based industry, like finance, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4286.719999999999s)]
*  you can see everything every message, every email, every document, and you can start [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4292.0s)]
*  the security model and the data model becomes very complicated. And all of that stuff, like, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4296.96s)]
*  for example, like, how do you know that this spreadsheet is actually, you should learn on it, [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4302.0s)]
*  but who gets to actually then have that added to the subset of answers, right? All of a sudden, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4307.6s)]
*  like salaries, yeah, HR information, information gets put into the training model very dangerous, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4314.0s)]
*  or subset A of a company's working on a proprietary chip design, but they actually [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4320.320000000001s)]
*  like the way that Apple runs, highly, highly segregated teams where nobody else can know. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4324.240000000001s)]
*  So there's all kinds of complicated security and data model and usage questions there. But [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4329.120000000001s)]
*  yeah, for every new world. So there's been a lot of discussion real estate, you shared a video with [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4334.64s)]
*  us, why don't you kick it off for us here? Freeberg, what's going on in commercial real [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4338.96s)]
*  estate and Sachs, you've got holdings and a lot of thoughts as well. So let's kick up the commercial [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4341.84s)]
*  real estate challenges of the moment. Well, I mean, I think we're teeing off of Barry's comments [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4345.52s)]
*  at this event last week, he and I met backstage because I spoke right before him. And then he [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4352.64s)]
*  gave this talk, which is available on YouTube, where he talked about the state of the commercial [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4358.96s)]
*  real estate market, and particularly he talked about the office market. Just to take a step back [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4362.56s)]
*  to talk about the scale of commercial real estate as an asset class in the US, Nick, if you'll pull [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4368.240000000001s)]
*  up this chart, the total estimated market value of commercial real estate in the US, across different [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4373.84s)]
*  categories is about $20 trillion, with about $3 trillion being in the office market, which is [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4380.72s)]
*  specifically what he was talking about. And he was saying that in the US, we're seeing people not [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4386.400000000001s)]
*  coming back to work, and all these offices are empty. And we've talked a lot about these offices [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4391.28s)]
*  being written down. So how significant of a problem is this? So $20 trillion asset class, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4395.04s)]
*  obviously, the multifamily market is probably not as bad as office and retail, which are the most [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4399.759999999999s)]
*  heavily affected, each of which are about $3 trillion a piece. The rest of these categories seem [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4404.719999999999s)]
*  relatively unscathed. In comparison, industrial hospitality, health care, you know, those, those [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4411.04s)]
*  real estate sectors are probably pretty strong data centers, obviously growing like crazy self [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4417.84s)]
*  storage, the great market, if you pull up the next image. So it turns out that of the $20 trillion [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4421.76s)]
*  of market value, there's about $6 trillion of debt. So you can kind of think about that $20 [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4428.08s)]
*  trillion being $6 trillion owned by the debt holders and $14 trillion by the equity holders. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4433.4400000000005s)]
*  And the debt is owned roughly 50% by banks and thrifts. And this was this concern that [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4440.72s)]
*  we've been talking about with higher rates is the debt on office actually going to be able to pay [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4447.6s)]
*  the debt on retail going to be able to pay when half of that debt is held by banks and thrifts [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4451.04s)]
*  that as we've talked about, have such a close ratio to deposits, that you can actually see many [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4455.360000000001s)]
*  banks become technically insolvent. If the debt starts to default, Barry's point that he made was [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4462.240000000001s)]
*  if you look at the office market, which you know, is marked on everyone's books as $3 trillion of [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4468.8s)]
*  market value, he thinks it's probably worth closer to 1.8 trillion. So there's $1.2 trillion of loss [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4475.2s)]
*  in the office category. And if you assume 40% of that 3 trillion is held as debt, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4483.76s)]
*  you're talking about $1.2 trillion of office debt, a reduction from 3 trillion to 1.8 trillion [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4490.08s)]
*  means that the equity value has gone down from 1.8 trillion to 600 billion. So they've lost [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4497.44s)]
*  equity holders in office real estate have probably lost two thirds of their value, [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4504.88s)]
*  two thirds of their investment. And who owns all of that? Most of that 60 plus percent call it two [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4510.08s)]
*  thirds of that is likely owned by private equity funds and other institutions, where the end [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4517.36s)]
*  beneficiary is actually pension funds and retirement funds. And so if two thirds of the value has to be [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4522.72s)]
*  written off in these books, and it hasn't happened yet, what's going to happen to all these retirement [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4528.400000000001s)]
*  funds? And this is where going back to my speculation a couple months ago, kind of gets [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4532.16s)]
*  revisited. If you're actually talking about a two third write down on the value in these funds, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4536.5599999999995s)]
*  most of that being pension funds, you're not going to see governments let that happen. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4540.5599999999995s)]
*  It's gonna there's gonna be some action at some point. And it's unlikely the office market is [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4547.599999999999s)]
*  going to suddenly rebound overnight. If this stays the way it is, who's going to fill that [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4552.639999999999s)]
*  hole for retirees and pensioners? Because we're not going to let that all get written down, [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4557.76s)]
*  someone is going to step in and say, we've got to do something about this. And there's going to need [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4562.08s)]
*  to be some sort of structured solution to support retirees and pensioners, because that's ultimately, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4565.6s)]
*  who ends up holding the bag in this massive write down, he didn't go all the way there in his [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4570.96s)]
*  statements, he was talking more about his estimate of 3 trillion to 1.8 trillion. And then I tried to [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4575.04s)]
*  connect the dots and what that actually means. And ultimately, there's going to be some pain felt by [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4579.68s)]
*  retirement funds that's going to need to be dealt with somehow. So I don't know if that if that [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4584.48s)]
*  sits right with you. I mean, I think the big picture is right. I think you're applying a lot [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4589.2s)]
*  of averages. Right. I think in the office market, in particular, the typical office deal is more [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4592.799999999999s)]
*  like one third equity and two thirds debt, there's a lot more leverage. Right. So the point number [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4598.879999999999s)]
*  one, which makes the situation worse, even worse. Yeah. So I would say that there's a huge amount of [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4604.32s)]
*  equity that's been written off. But in addition to that, there's a lot of debt holders who are in [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4610.4s)]
*  trouble too. And that debt is held by regional banks. So these commercial loan portfolios are [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4617.28s)]
*  significantly impaired. That's what we saw with Community Bank of New York is that their stock [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4624.48s)]
*  cratered when they reported higher than expected losses in their commercial real estate portfolio. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4628.96s)]
*  So, Freberg, I think the point is just the pain from this is not just going to be on [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4635.44s)]
*  the equity holders, but also on these banks, which can't afford to lose or even be distributed. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4642.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Right. Yeah. Right. And we saw this in San Francisco, where some of these buildings have 70% [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4648.48s)]
*  debt to equity ratios. And, you know, the value puts them in the hole and equities wiped out [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4654.24s)]
*  completely and the debt holders have to take a hit. And normally, you know, that debt is not really [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4659.36s)]
*  written off very often. Well, this is why the debt holders, the debt holders don't want to foreclose. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4664.08s)]
*  They don't want to get these buildings back because when they do, they're going to have to [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4669.2s)]
*  write down the loan. As long as the loan is still outstanding and they haven't foreclosed, they can [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4672.48s)]
*  pretend that the value of the building is not impaired. Kick the can down the road is the best [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4677.36s)]
*  strategy for them. So it's called pretend and extend. So what they'll do is they'll work out a deal [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4682.24s)]
*  with the landlord, the equity holder that the equity holder would say, listen, I can't pay [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4688.08s)]
*  the interest. So they'll just tack on the interest basically as principle at the end of the loan. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4693.2s)]
*  And they'll extend out the term of the loan. Which would wipe out the equity at a certain point. Yeah. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4698.8s)]
*  And what it does is it allows the equity holders to stay in control, own the building. Right. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4703.92s)]
*  Because, yeah, the equity holder can't make their debt payments today, but they're going to postpone [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4709.76s)]
*  those debt payments till the end of the loan. And again, in the meantime, just kind of hope that [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4715.12s)]
*  the market recovers. Couldn't that debt at some point, since they have so little equity in these [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4720.96s)]
*  buildings typically just exceed the value of the property. And it's like, I'm just working for the [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4724.16s)]
*  bank now. And why am I even putting this work in? Because everyone kind of hopes that the market [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4729.92s)]
*  will recover the value of their equity will go up and they'll be able to make their debt payments [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4735.36s)]
*  again. Yeah. So if you're the equity holder, you'd rather hold on and have a chance of your equity [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4739.92s)]
*  being worth something in recovery, then definitely lose the building. And if you're a regional bank, [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4746.0s)]
*  you'd rather blend and extend or pretend and extend as opposed to having to realize the loss [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4750.96s)]
*  right now and showing the market that your solvency may not be as good as you thought. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4757.36s)]
*  The same thing happened with government bonds. Remember that with SVB and these other banks, [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4763.12s)]
*  they had these huge held to maturity bond portfolios. Yeah. These are main mostly just [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4768.32s)]
*  T bills that were worth, I don't know, 60 cents on the dollar when interest rates spiked from [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4775.12s)]
*  zero to 5%. But they didn't have to recognize that loss as long as they weren't planning to sell them. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4780.320000000001s)]
*  Right. And then when they had the bank run, they had to sell. Well, yeah, that's right. So when [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4787.76s)]
*  depositors left because they needed their money or because there was a run or because they could get [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4792.0s)]
*  higher rates in a money market fund, all of a sudden these banks had to sell their held to [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4797.4400000000005s)]
*  maturity portfolios, they had to recognize that loss. And that's when everyone realized, oh, wait [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4802.96s)]
*  a second, they're not actually solving. Okay, so Jamal, supply demand matters in real estate. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4806.96s)]
*  We have a tale of two cities here on one side in real estate for commercial real estate, [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4811.76s)]
*  no demand for office space, which is in way too much supply. Paradoxically, on the other side, [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4816.96s)]
*  we have this incredible market for developers, which is, gosh, there's not enough homes, [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4824.08s)]
*  I think we need 7 million more homes. And the demand is off the charts for homes. Yeah. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4828.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think you're basically right. It's not I keep trying to explain residential is not [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4833.84s)]
*  a great market either because interest rates have spiked up. So there's not a vacancy problem. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4837.4400000000005s)]
*  Multifamily developers are still able to lease the units, they're still able to rent. The problem is [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4842.16s)]
*  their financing costs have shot through the roof. So again, let's say you were a developer who built [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4848.56s)]
*  multifamily in the last few years, you took out a construction loan. That construction loan might [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4854.16s)]
*  have been at 34%. Now, you want to put long term financing on it. But if you can even find debt [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4859.28s)]
*  right now, because there's a credit crunch going on, you might have to pay eight, nine, 10%. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4866.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, but at least you can find a renter. You can find a renter that's true, but only at a certain [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4870.5599999999995s)]
*  price. And let's say you underwrote that property to I don't know, like a five cap, like a certain [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4875.679999999999s)]
*  yield. Yeah, but now your financing costs are much higher than you thought. You might be underwater. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4880.8s)]
*  Yeah, that situation isn't as bad as what's happening in [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4886.56s)]
*  why I think it's worse in some ways. If you're fully rented, and your building is underwater, [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4890.8s)]
*  because now your debt payments are much higher than you expected, then there's no business model. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4898.88s)]
*  Yeah, but are we seeing that? Are we seeing tons of multifamily go under? [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4903.12s)]
*  Can I make two points? One, I think David is is right, which is that I don't know this market [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4906.400000000001s)]
*  very well, but just as a as a bystander, here's what I observed. It seems that the residential [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4912.0s)]
*  market has a feature. And I don't know whether it's good or bad. But that feature is that you [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4917.36s)]
*  reprice to market demand every year. So to the extent that supply demand is changing, and [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4924.96s)]
*  default rates are up or whatever, that's reflected in rents. And you see that because rents change [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4931.28s)]
*  very quickly, and most human beings are signing six month to one year leases. So that reset happens [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4937.28s)]
*  very quickly, so it can more dynamically adapt. So to the extent that a market segment is impaired, [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4942.88s)]
*  you see the impairment quickly. On the on the office side, what I see is that there's been a [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4948.4s)]
*  structural behavior change in COVID that has reset in every other part of the world, except for the [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4954.0s)]
*  United States, where there are these, frankly, typically younger, typically more junior employees, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4961.04s)]
*  that have held many of these companies hostage in a bid to return back to office space. And so we [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4968.24s)]
*  know that there is this vacancy cliff that's going to hit commercial real estate. We just don't know [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4974.16s)]
*  when because there are there in long term leases, they're canceling these leases over long periods [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4979.36s)]
*  of time. So the reset cycle is longer. That's just my observation as an outsider. I don't know what [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4983.92s)]
*  that means for for prices or anything else. But it just seems that at least the residential market [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4988.4s)]
*  can find a bottoming sooner, because you can reset prices every year. But commercial just seems like [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4993.5199999999995s)]
*  a melting ice direction. Correct to you, sex. That assessment commercial has both a demand problem [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=4998.639999999999s)]
*  and a financing problem. multifamily just has a financing problem. But it's important. We're [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5006.4s)]
*  talking about office, retail, and then there's the office and then there's other industrial China. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5011.2s)]
*  China has 50 million homes ahead of schedule, 50 million additional supply that can house 150 [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5017.28s)]
*  million people. So as acute as our issues are, the China issue might be much, much seismic. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5024.8s)]
*  Can we just give you an example on the multifamily side? Okay, let's say that you buy a building, [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5030.96s)]
*  okay, let's say you bought a building in 2021, the absolute peak of the market. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5035.5199999999995s)]
*  And you could get debt at say, 4%. Okay, and you penciled out, let's call it a 6% yield, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5039.5199999999995s)]
*  that with the debt you're getting. So let's say you did two thirds debt at 4%. You could now lever [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5047.2s)]
*  up that 6% yield to 10%. Okay, that's like sort of the math, right? Now all of a sudden, and to [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5054.24s)]
*  get there, you'd have to do some value added work on the property, you have to spruce it up. Okay. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5061.04s)]
*  Now it's a few years later, and your short term financing is running out and you need to refi and [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5065.92s)]
*  you've done your value added work. But here's the problem. The overall valuations in the market have [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5072.4s)]
*  come way down. So before, the bank was willing to give you two thirds loan to value. Now the values [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5077.759999999999s)]
*  come way down. You may not even be able to get two thirds loan to value. So you're going to have to [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5084.639999999999s)]
*  do what's called an equity in refinancing. You're going to have to produce more equity. You're [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5088.24s)]
*  going to have to pony up more money. So instead of taking equity out, like when the deal goes well, [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5093.759999999999s)]
*  you're going to have to put equity in. You may not have that equity if you're the developer. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5097.839999999999s)]
*  The other thing is that your financing costs now might be 10%. So now you've got negative leverage. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5101.6s)]
*  You're generating a 6% yield, but you're borrowing at 10% to generate that 6% yield. So the debt no [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5107.2s)]
*  longer makes sense. Again, you're not positively leveraged, you're negatively leveraged. So [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5114.32s)]
*  you're not going to want to take out that debt. And if you do take out that debt, [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5118.96s)]
*  the building's going to be underwater. It's not going to be generating net operating income. It's [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5123.36s)]
*  going to be generating losses. So that's why even categories like multifamily, [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5127.12s)]
*  where you don't have a vacancy problem, there's strong demand. Those properties still don't make [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5134.96s)]
*  sense. If you had long-term debt on your multifamily, if you were able to lock in that 4% [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5140.4s)]
*  loan for 10 years, you're fine. But for all the people who are refinancing now, who are coming up [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5146.08s)]
*  this year, last year, next year, they're in deep trouble. And that's why there's a rolling crisis [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5152.08s)]
*  in real estate is because the debt rolls over time. It's not like everybody hits the wall [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5158.08s)]
*  and has to refinance at the same time. Well, thank God, right? I mean, this would be cataclysmic [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5163.28s)]
*  if it was. And can you imagine if Silicon Valley and San Francisco had to say, here's actually [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5167.68s)]
*  the reality, anybody want to actually pay for this office all in the same year? That would be [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5172.96s)]
*  insane. But the crisis is growing. As the leases roll, and those old rents that were higher than [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5179.2s)]
*  market roll off, and now you have to take on new leases if you can even get them. It's going to be [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5185.599999999999s)]
*  balanced. And as the old loans roll that were at a much lower interest rate, you have to get financing [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5191.28s)]
*  even if you get it at a much higher interest rate. That's when all of a sudden these buildings go [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5197.5199999999995s)]
*  from being basically solvent to insolvent. Yeah. I mean, Janet Yellen's just going to [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5201.599999999999s)]
*  bail these folks out. That means you won't bail out the banks themselves, but you'll bail out [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5207.44s)]
*  the creditors, obviously the people holding the bag. They'll get bailed. Yeah, that's everybody [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5210.719999999999s)]
*  agrees. Janet Yellen? Yellen. Our treasury secretary. I don't know if she's going to be [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5215.44s)]
*  the one to do it. I think there's going to be congressional action on this stuff. Yeah, I mean, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5221.36s)]
*  they tend to lead it so. All right, for the Sultan of Science, David Pryberg and David Sachs [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5226.5599999999995s)]
*  and Tramal Palliha-Hapitiya, the chairman dictator. I am the world's greatest moderator. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5233.76s)]
*  We'll see you next time on the All In Pod. Bye bye. Bye bye. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5237.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm going all in [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHO4hoXc75k&t=5293.04s)]
