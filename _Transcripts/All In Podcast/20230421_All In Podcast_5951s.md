# E125 SpaceX launch, Fox News settlement, Zombie-corn exodus to AI, late-stage implosion
**All In Podcast:** [April 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis)
*  Hey, everybody, welcome to episode 125 of the All In podcast on historic day, we're taping 420, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=0.0s)]
*  really excited that SpaceX was able to launch Starship, and it made it off the launch pad and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=8.24s)]
*  incredibly successful today, day today. We have of course with us the Rain Man David Sacks, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=15.52s)]
*  the Sultan of Science David Friedberg, and of course the dictator Chamath Palihapitiya, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=21.2s)]
*  but two special guests are here. Special guests, Gavin Baker from Atreides. How do you pronounce [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=25.44s)]
*  it? Atreides. Atreides. House Atreides. House Atreides, if you know Dune. And then SpaceX [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=32.24s)]
*  board member, Antonio Gracias, one of the first investors in SpaceX. Antonio, a big day for you. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=38.72s)]
*  Maybe you could just tell the audience what happened today, why that is so important in [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=45.6s)]
*  the history of this company. Well, first I want to thank you guys for letting me [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=51.44s)]
*  come on and have a little chat with you about this. Today was extraordinarily important for [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=56.239999999999995s)]
*  SpaceX, I think for America and for humanity. And the Starship is the realization of the vision [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  Elon had 20 years ago, 25 years ago, even as a child really, to go to Mars. And the engineers [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=70.32s)]
*  here at SpaceX and the entire team working extremely hard, really just to get this vehicle [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=77.36s)]
*  off the pad, as Elon has said, right? This is a brand new vehicle. Everything about it is new. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  So the engines, the material science, the structure, the design, all of it new. And the most important [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=88.32s)]
*  thing here was to get off the pad so we could collect data. And this technology platform is [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=94.72s)]
*  the platform that will allow us to go to Mars. So from a non-engineer standpoint, why this is [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=99.44s)]
*  important is that what we've proven with this flight, we got past a point called Max Q, which [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=104.72s)]
*  is the point at which the vehicle takes maximum stress. That's how I think about it. And sure, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=111.2s)]
*  engineers are taking a lot more description to it. Or David Freberg give you a better description [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=114.88s)]
*  to it. But it's the most amount of stress in the vehicle, which means this vehicle will get to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=118.56s)]
*  orbit. And this is the vehicle that's going to take us to Mars. So today is the day that all of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=122.48s)]
*  the hardworking people at SpaceX accomplished a goal of making the human race spacefaring. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=128.64s)]
*  When we look back in history, I believe this will be the day we mark the technological development [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=135.04s)]
*  that we broke through and built a vehicle that could actually go to Mars. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=140.39999999999998s)]
*  S1 C1 Now when we look at it, obviously, it didn't make it to orbit. Maybe you can give some context [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=144.0s)]
*  into what is the typical life cycle of a new rocket ship coming out. The Falcon, the original one, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  has done I think 224 missions, 222 of them successful, I think, 160 or so actually [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=157.2s)]
*  landed themselves. Yes. And so you had two or three mulligans, I think, in the development of that, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=164.39999999999998s)]
*  maybe two actually. So what can we expect here? When are they going to stack and rack and launch [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  the next one? Antonio, let's see, what's the timeline here to getting to orbit? What would [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=175.12s)]
*  we expect versus some of the other projects that we've seen like the Russian rockets? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=179.83999999999997s)]
*  So look, this is a brand new vehicle. And whenever we develop a brand new vehicle, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=184.08s)]
*  it takes a long time development. You know, my understanding of all this is, again, a layman [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=188.72s)]
*  and sort of as a board member, not an executive here, is that it'll take at least two or three [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=194.72s)]
*  months to really get the pad rebuilt and get another vehicle back on for testing, maybe longer. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=199.52s)]
*  But it's really important to note here that we've gotten sort of used to the idea that SpaceX [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=204.48s)]
*  launches rockets and all these rockets come back and all those vehicles are stable because [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=208.88s)]
*  the Falcon 9 and 9 Heavy are so stable and they're so well engineered and they're amazing [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=212.56s)]
*  vehicles, the most reliable vehicles on earth in human history. This is a brand new vehicle. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  This was a huge win. I mean, it was an enormous win for the company, enormous win for the country, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=222.16s)]
*  just getting you off the pad and collecting the data. And now we know it works. We just have to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=226.72s)]
*  get it stable now and get it up to orbit. So it's really, it's a hard problem, but it's a [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=230.88s)]
*  solvable problem from here. And the we learned here is that this vehicle does work. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=237.28s)]
*  Amazing. Can you guys talk about like the impact of this vehicle cost to launch payload, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=242.96s)]
*  like the big metrics that are that kind of help realize that outcome? Gavin, I think I saw you [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=249.12s)]
*  did a bunch of really good tweets on this. You shared some of the metrics that I thought were [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=255.2s)]
*  really succinct and really helpful. Yeah, sure. So when this is, I think it's a long road to full [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=259.28s)]
*  reusability. You know, the first step will be Mechazilla catching the booster. It doesn't have [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=264.96s)]
*  legs like the Falcon 9. And then the second step will be landing the Starship, which is really hard. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=273.2s)]
*  But once you do that, they should be able to send over a hundred metric tons to orbit at a [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=278.96s)]
*  variable cost of under $2 million per public data. These are public statements. I would never confirm [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=285.67999999999995s)]
*  or deny those statements. This is Gavin's math off the back of the envelope. $2 million is the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=293.76s)]
*  cost to get a hundred tons into orbit. That's the metric. Variable cost. Variable cost. So I think [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=298.96s)]
*  the point Gavin's making, if I might just please add, is that it is a step function change. It's [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  not like a small change. It's an enormous change. Right. Can you compare that to the numbers before [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=309.76s)]
*  for folks to understand? The Falcon 9 mass to useful orbit is 17 metric tons. And the variable [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=314.32s)]
*  costs that, you know, I have seen Elon tweet about is somewhere around $15 million. So you are lifting [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=324.88s)]
*  more than five times the mass to orbit. And based on other statements, that hundred metric tons is [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  a very conservative estimate. And you are doing it at call it 10 to 15% of the cost. So this is a, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=341.12s)]
*  you know, we can all do the math, but we can envelope it, you know, roughly a 50X change. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=351.6s)]
*  And this, you know, massively changes unit economics for Starlink for sending anything into orbit. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=359.76s)]
*  And as Antonio said, it's great for SpaceX. It's great for America. And it's [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=366.24s)]
*  great for everyone. It's great for humanity. It's great for humanity. Can you explain how [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=371.12s)]
*  that then translates into going to Mars? So now we can get 100 tons into orbit for $2 million. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=376.0s)]
*  What happens next in terms of like how that payload capacity and low cost enables, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=380.88s)]
*  you know, full transport to Mars? And, you know, I know that the timelines are tough, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=386.32s)]
*  but it would be super helpful to just translate the orbit concept into the let's go to Mars [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=391.2s)]
*  concept. It's important to know that like the size of this thing, it gives a sense of scale, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=395.44s)]
*  is the interior space of it is the size of the International Space Station. So it's a huge amount [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=399.12s)]
*  of tonnage. Just think about all that's going to take to get to Mars, right? You've got to, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=405.68s)]
*  you'd have to lift a payload into orbit. You have to, you know, create a base either on the moon or [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=409.52s)]
*  it's orbiting the earth to actually refill ships and send them out into space. And this same design [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=415.92s)]
*  will scale up to become the Mars colonial transporter, very similar design. That's why [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=420.4s)]
*  it's important. And look, the timeline on that, I don't know. I'm hoping that it will be, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=424.8s)]
*  while I'm still able to go, that would be great physically able to go. But that's really why it's [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=428.8s)]
*  important to get this as a small version of the same vehicle we will actually use to go to Mars. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=433.44s)]
*  And then all the stuff you have to transport to orbit becomes more economic, because as Gavin [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  just said, we've had, you know, a 50 X kind of reduction in cost. Can I ask you another question? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  Sorry, I don't mean to monopolize the questions. But these are things that I think are like super [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=449.12s)]
*  important questions, but that a lot of people often ask, or I hear them asking, but what happens [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=453.12s)]
*  with the space industry in the nearer term? So there's this great long-term goal, get to Mars. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=459.76s)]
*  That's a, that's a big project. There'll certainly be funding, I'm sure, to run that project. But what [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=464.32s)]
*  other economies now emerge as this, this cost down of 50 X happens? And what else do you think [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=470.0s)]
*  happens besides communications and Starlink? Obviously there's, that's already a pretty [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=475.44s)]
*  scaled business. What other markets can develop here in the near term? What other economies do [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=479.76s)]
*  you see happening as a result of this cost down? Yeah. I mean, look, Gavin could jump in here too, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=483.04s)]
*  but the reality is once you can take that much mass to orbit, you can move anything around the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=488.40000000000003s)]
*  planet very quickly. You can kind of go up or spin below, you can come down. So transportation [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  generally changes. You know, if you want to fly to Tokyo from New York City, it goes from being, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=495.92s)]
*  you know, a day trip to a matter of hours. It's extraordinary. Or a container ship in a couple [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=502.24s)]
*  hours. Yeah. Everything that's rapid transport around the earth, even packages around there, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=507.2s)]
*  everything gets faster. Yeah. There will be no more Trans Pacific or Trans Atlantic cargo flights. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=510.64s)]
*  I think in five, six, seven, eight, 10 years, you're going to need a big Starship fleet to [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=518.0s)]
*  accomplish that. But I think the Trans Atlantic and Trans Pacific aerospace cargo routes go away. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=522.8s)]
*  So transportation logistics, I think is a fundamental change, human transport, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=531.52s)]
*  fundamental change. And then there's all the knock on effects of buildings, kind of technology. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=535.44s)]
*  Look, the space program, the American space program that took us to the moon, created the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=539.84s)]
*  cell phones we use, right? And there's so much this chip designs, all the technology came off [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=543.9200000000001s)]
*  of that, the same kind of effects we believe will happen here. So it's hard to predict, but it will [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=548.5600000000001s)]
*  be a lot of great stuff. That's kind of the point when you can get payload up there. Now entrepreneurs [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=553.2800000000001s)]
*  can think of a million different crazy ideas and affordably put something up there, whether they [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=558.6400000000001s)]
*  want to mine an asteroid, or they have a science project. Now, 1000 flowers, a million flowers can [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=563.28s)]
*  bloom and entrepreneurs can start thinking about it. And that's already happened to a certain extent [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=570.16s)]
*  with Falcon, that people are able to come up with great ideas. Well, I have to say, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=574.16s)]
*  and inspiration provides. It does. Yeah, it's amazing to be here and feel the inspiration and [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=579.12s)]
*  the just the joy. I think that's what I was going to ask you about if you know, as we wrap here with [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=584.24s)]
*  you too. If you could, if you could take people inside mission control, which we were privileged [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=588.24s)]
*  enough to be in the sense of history, and the feeling in that room, if you could describe it [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=593.6800000000001s)]
*  for the audience, what those engineers were feeling, and what you in fact felt at that moment, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=600.96s)]
*  Antonio, and then Kevin. So I would start by juxtaposing with Monday. So we were here Monday, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=607.6s)]
*  we're here Monday, Monday, and Monday, I think there was a real sense of concern, you know, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=614.32s)]
*  the countdown stopped around 10 minutes, the vehicle, we had a valve failure and the valve [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=620.0s)]
*  got stuck open, basically. And we had to stop and kind of regroup. And by the way, from my perspective, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=624.4000000000001s)]
*  that's like a solid success, because the vehicle did not get destroyed in the pad, which is like [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=630.4000000000001s)]
*  the number one thing to have happen here. So success. The second, so that was kind of Monday, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=636.08s)]
*  and I think Monday was, yeah, caution and intensity. It was a very intense, very intense, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=640.72s)]
*  can this will this will this ever happen? Yeah, when will it happen? Yeah. Today, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=646.5600000000001s)]
*  what I felt in that room was a sense of, there was a high sense of intensity, a high sense of focus, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=652.32s)]
*  and also a sense of people were excited. There was excitement about it. It felt different today, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=659.76s)]
*  it felt more electric today. They were super focused, but you could feel the excitement in [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=668.72s)]
*  the room, they believed it was going to happen, they thought it was highly probable, and that it [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=673.2s)]
*  was going to work. And when it did work, I would say it was a sense of elation and joy. And just, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=676.8000000000001s)]
*  you know, this is this is 20 plus years of work. And, you know, Elon was here in the room with the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=682.72s)]
*  engineers, and it just seeing him light up, seeing the joy that he felt, seeing the joy the engineers [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=687.12s)]
*  felt together for me. And having been a board member here in investor for a long time and [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=693.52s)]
*  sort of been a bit along this company and seen develop, it brought a real sense of hope. Yeah, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=698.72s)]
*  for what's going to happen to this country and what's happening to humanity. And it's such a joy [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=705.12s)]
*  to my heart. Yeah. Gavin, do you have any emotional feelings there when you watch it? You want to add? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=709.52s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think it's also just what I know what always strikes me when I'm here is this is a [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=714.72s)]
*  sandy spit of land. There was no power, no electricity, no potable water, you know, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=719.92s)]
*  no sewage, no utilities, nothing. And out of this, you know, sandy spit of desert, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=726.88s)]
*  you know, on the Gulf of Mexico, a extremely talented group of engineers, the last five years [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=733.28s)]
*  have lived in, you know, these, these air streams, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=741.12s)]
*  you know, a long way from a major city. And it is, it is just an amazing place to visit. And, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=746.0s)]
*  you know, the sense of commitment. And when you talk to anyone at SpaceX, anyone here at [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=754.48s)]
*  Starbase, you know, what are you trying to accomplish, make humanity multi planetary species, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=759.12s)]
*  get to Mars. So the experience of visiting Starbase is amazing. Second, I would just say [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=763.92s)]
*  launches are very visceral. It's shocking if you have not experienced one. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=770.56s)]
*  The ground shaking. Yeah, feeling your chest, you feel it in your field, the yeah, you feel your [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=776.7199999999999s)]
*  body shaking like an earthquake. Yeah, it but it doesn't stop. And it's incredibly dramatic. You [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=781.92s)]
*  know, the rocket, it's going so slow at first, and then it accelerates. And then you hear this [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=787.1199999999999s)]
*  enormous crackling noise that's, you know, louder than any concert, louder than any, you know, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=792.8s)]
*  sports stadium, then a blast of hot air hits you, you feel it. And I would say, a lot of people at [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=798.32s)]
*  launches cry. It's a very emotional experience, often for people who are who are not. Yeah, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=807.12s)]
*  it's hard not to get emotional. I think just that human beings can accomplish something like this [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=811.6s)]
*  is amazing. And then what I would just say is, you know, there was the rocket flew for four minutes, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=817.36s)]
*  and went through Max Q, it went to 39 kilometers, the Soviet in one, which was comparable rocket [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=825.44s)]
*  only reached 12 kilometers. Like the team was ecstatic. Yeah, the joy on their faces happy. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=831.6800000000001s)]
*  Cheer. You've never seen anything like it. Yeah, it was awesome. It was very inspirational. And I [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=840.08s)]
*  felt very, very grateful to be there. Yeah, incredible. Yeah. Can I give you one thought [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=844.6400000000001s)]
*  of what I'm feeling right now? Yeah, the after effect. The after effect after glow. It's just [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=850.4000000000001s)]
*  an extraordinary sense of gratitude. I mean, there has been so much sacrifice here. And we [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=854.4s)]
*  witnessed it over 20 years from from Elon, of course, and the amount of just, you know, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=859.28s)]
*  unbelievable worth going from him and the entire team at SpaceX as engineers, everyone who works [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=864.64s)]
*  here. Yeah, it's been extraordinary. And it just really, I'm just deeply grateful. Incredible and [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=869.12s)]
*  grateful to you all for having us on. Thank you. Incredible. It's great to hear that perspective, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=873.84s)]
*  because you would not have gotten it from off the Twitter feed, you know, from the mainstream [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=878.24s)]
*  media. David, if you'd come here with us, you could have gotten. Yeah, David, you were invited. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=884.32s)]
*  You were invited. You almost we almost shamed. I'm sorry. There's a new term called starship [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=889.28s)]
*  as opposed to Shanghai. We're going to Shanghai starship you. We're going to starship you next [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=894.08s)]
*  time. I'm bummed I couldn't be there, but I'm excited to see how excited you guys are. And [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=898.5600000000001s)]
*  just the point I was making is that when I was reading the mainstream media coverage of this, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=904.48s)]
*  it was almost like ghoulish. It was like a type of glee. It was almost like that the rocket blew up, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=909.2s)]
*  but they didn't they didn't really mention any of the things you're mentioning. I mean, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=915.76s)]
*  from the point of view of the people who are there, it was a triumph. And it was exciting because of [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=919.44s)]
*  the data that was collected and the fact that this rocket even got off the earth and achieved [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=924.32s)]
*  this trial for four minutes, but the media never really conveyed that. So thank you for giving us [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=929.04s)]
*  perspective that you just would not have gotten today from the New York Times or other mainstream [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=933.44s)]
*  media. And just to add to that, just a little bit of context. You know, this is an iterative [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=938.08s)]
*  design process with rapid improvement. This starship had 31 engines that were made over the course of [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=943.0400000000001s)]
*  one year, had different tolerances, behaved unpredictable unpredictably. You know, this was [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=949.2800000000001s)]
*  far from the best starship. The one that's going to launch in three months or two months or four [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=956.0s)]
*  months or five months or whatever it is, they've already made over 1000 discrete improvements to it. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=959.84s)]
*  And that was before they got all the data for today. And then there's a starship after that. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=966.48s)]
*  And after that. So I think it really is a the what the mainstream media just failed to understand is [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=970.88s)]
*  the process under which a new rocket platform is deployed, and how revolutionary this is, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=980.0s)]
*  they are iterating at a speed here. That's not what I don't think people can comprehend. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=985.76s)]
*  I mean, on this note, that's important. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=992.0s)]
*  They don't care. And it was a way to paint somebody who they dislike, and they are threatened by a [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=994.56s)]
*  negative light. The front page of the Wall Street Journal says SpaceX's starship explodes shortly [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1000.4s)]
*  after launching uncrewed test flight. If you take Antonio Gracia's explanation, which was articulate, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1005.92s)]
*  and transparent and fair, and this headline, you could not be more further apart on the spectrum [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1012.72s)]
*  of truth. Antonio just said that this is a day just for the audience of which there are millions [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1019.6s)]
*  of people now. Antonio said this is the day that you look back on when we are multi planetary, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1024.4s)]
*  as this Cambrian moment, if you will, this incredible point of innovation and human ingenuity [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1030.4s)]
*  and teamwork and sacrifice, you know, Gavin said it as well, just giving up five years of your life [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1037.28s)]
*  to move in the middle of nowhere and live in an airstream trailer. And then the Wall Street [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1042.96s)]
*  Journal was basically perspective. I mean, it was just fireworks. It was just a firework. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1047.52s)]
*  I sent a note to my own team. I just said, I said, look, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1057.04s)]
*  ignore, please ignore the news media. Yeah, it's total BS. This is a huge success. It's a huge [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1059.92s)]
*  success. And we should just step back for a second and enjoy success. Because part of the [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1065.92s)]
*  problem with the news media is this is a moment that should galvanize our country. I mean, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1071.2s)]
*  space is about America. Space is an American company. This is about America. I think they [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1075.28s)]
*  can't see that it galvanizes potentially galvanizes support for human being that they feel deeply [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1080.88s)]
*  threatened by. And that's what it all comes down to ultimately. And that's what you see in the [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1087.04s)]
*  headlines. That's why what's so interesting about this is that the behavior of the mainstream [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1091.04s)]
*  media to now paint this as something unsuccessful or a joke or rocket goes boom or fireworks. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1095.68s)]
*  When you look back on something as meaningful as this, it'll just make them even less credible. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1101.2s)]
*  That's unfortunately what they're doing to themselves is shooting themselves in the foot. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1106.48s)]
*  Soterios Johnson It's pretty sad. Yeah. And this wasn't just Wall Street Journal. This is CNN, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1109.52s)]
*  New York Times, everybody just painted it as a failure. And it's like, oh, here's a collection [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1114.0s)]
*  of headlines. Well done, producer Nick. I mean, literally, you would think if you read the [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1118.96s)]
*  mainstream media that SpaceX failed. And it really the when I was talking to Elon, months ago about [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1123.6s)]
*  this, you know, he said, Listen, 5050, we get off the launch pad. Yeah, if we can get off the launch [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1131.12s)]
*  pad, and we don't blow up the launch pad, that's a huge success. The fact that this thing got as [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1135.9199999999998s)]
*  far as it is in four minutes, and they got all that data. And they've got when you see the scale [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1141.36s)]
*  of this factor, and I hope you all get to come down here and all Americans get to see this because, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1147.1999999999998s)]
*  for me, you know, and being friends with the long for as long as I have, and to watch him go from [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1152.48s)]
*  the idea of this, and he showed me, I went with Elon to see the the Hawthorne factory when he was [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1157.68s)]
*  considering renting. And from that moment to now, to see the suffering that he went through personally [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1163.68s)]
*  to do this, and the team, the amount of suffering to get to this point has been so tremendous. But [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1169.68s)]
*  when you go to the gigafactory in Texas, when you see what's happening here at Starbase, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1177.04s)]
*  it should let you know that this is still the greatest country in the world with the greatest [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1182.1599999999999s)]
*  entrepreneurs. And he is truly the greatest entrepreneur of our lifetime. And I'm not just [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1186.6399999999999s)]
*  saying that because he's my bestie. I'm saying it because it's objectively true. And when you see [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1191.36s)]
*  headlines in the press, look at what has been accomplished, look at the Tesla's on the road, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1196.1599999999999s)]
*  look at what happened with this rocket ship and judge the man by what has been produced to date, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1202.3200000000002s)]
*  and understand he's going to keep going. And the team he has inspired is relentless. I spoke, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1208.88s)]
*  I sat there on the deck, and hour or two after all this went down, and I just ate some chips and [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1215.2s)]
*  salsa with a half dozen of the people who were in mission control. They love the podcast, they [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1221.04s)]
*  listen to every episode of all in I kid you're not. And they said, Will you talk about this on [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1227.2s)]
*  all and I said, Well, we talked about some all in. Thank you for what you've done for humanity. This [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1232.8s)]
*  is the most inspiring thing I've experienced in my whole life. We love you guys, SpaceX, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1236.8s)]
*  charge ahead, be relentless as you've been, and know that despite these absolutely insignificant [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1243.1200000000001s)]
*  headlines, what you're doing is so meaningful to every American and every human on this planet. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1250.32s)]
*  Don't stop, go faster, go harder, be more relentless. We're all cheering and we're in [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1256.72s)]
*  all of you. This is one topic we can all agree on. This is something that can galvanize America. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1262.6399999999999s)]
*  We are leading the world again. Yes, we're leading the world in the space race again, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1269.28s)]
*  we're going to be on the moon, we're going to be on Mars. What about Uranus? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1275.4399999999998s)]
*  I love you, brother. Thanks for coming on. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1279.0400000000002s)]
*  Give me a hug over here. Thanks for coming on. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1287.8400000000001s)]
*  Bye guys. See you guys. See you Gavin. Bye Antonio. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1290.88s)]
*  That was great. I'm surprised I beat Chamath to the punch there. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1294.96s)]
*  Oh no, we were all queued up. Chamath was having a moment he was like [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1298.5600000000002s)]
*  daydreaming about the future and not thinking about the line. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1302.24s)]
*  I was taking the number of shares of SpaceX I know and multiplying it by a billion trillion. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1305.68s)]
*  Billion trillion dollars per share. Wow. Yeah, the rest of us are thinking about humanity, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1312.24s)]
*  America, inspiring people, and Chamath's got his little calculator out. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1317.2s)]
*  I'm going to have a babushka of planes. A plane that will take the next flight. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1321.28s)]
*  Wow, ready to ruin the moment. Make it about you. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1326.5600000000002s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1329.76s)]
*  I did have a business question about how the Starship impacts Starlink. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1335.68s)]
*  Very simple. There's a graphic online you can find on the SpaceX YouTube channel, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1352.72s)]
*  and they show the Starship and it literally looks like a goddamn Pez dispenser shooting out the [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1357.6000000000001s)]
*  next version of Starlink. And these are, you know, without I don't want to speak about any [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1364.08s)]
*  specifics, but you can you can watch it spit them out. You can put out more, and they're obviously [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1370.32s)]
*  going to be more powerful. And if you have seen the size of the satellite, I have Starlink at [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1375.6s)]
*  both houses, the ski house and my main house as a backup. It's getting scary how good it is. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1381.76s)]
*  And if you look at the size of them, and I again, I don't want to speak about any future products. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1387.28s)]
*  It's not my place. But if you see the size getting smaller, there's one or two things that we all [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1393.6s)]
*  know about technology. Cheaper, faster, better, smaller. Just I would just say if you're if you're [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1399.12s)]
*  a fan of Starlink, just keep those words in mind. Yeah, it's gonna be pretty amazing what Starlink [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1406.08s)]
*  is going to be able to do. Yeah, I thought that maybe I read this somewhere that Starship can [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1411.44s)]
*  carry 600 plus satellites, whereas the previous top of the line rocket, the Falcon nine could only [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1416.0s)]
*  carry was it like 50 or something or? Yeah, I think a little less. Yeah, there's like 3040. So [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1424.4s)]
*  you're talking about 20 times the number of satellites can go up and at a lower expense. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1429.36s)]
*  Yeah. And I guess SpaceX has gotten permission from the FCC to put up about 12,000 Starlink [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1434.24s)]
*  satellites. So you could do that, you know, with, I guess it's just 20, you know, 20 missions. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1442.56s)]
*  The big disruption is going to happen by the end of 2026. Because this next generation set of [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1450.48s)]
*  licenses, spectral licenses that the FCC sold came with a condition that you had to launch [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1457.84s)]
*  satellite capacity by the end of 2026. I think otherwise you lose it. Or you have to do your [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1464.32s)]
*  first launch, I think by the end of 20. Any of the point is that the only company that actually [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1469.2s)]
*  has the capability to build and to launch is SpaceX. So they have a complete monopoly. And [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1473.76s)]
*  because they're advantaging their own solution, it puts everybody else behind the eight ball. So [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1478.24s)]
*  not only will they probably offer the best global internet connectivity at every single natural [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1485.3600000000001s)]
*  point in the world that you could be, which is going to be a really big leap, they're going to [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1491.76s)]
*  do it, Jason, as you said, at a throughput that's going to surprise people. And it's also going to [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1495.84s)]
*  render every other existing provider in a really difficult situation who's like, you know, what is [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1501.4399999999998s)]
*  their alternative, you can't launch with ULA because they're inconsistent. You can't launch [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1507.28s)]
*  with Blue Origin because they're inconsistent. You can't launch with the Europeans in general, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1511.6799999999998s)]
*  because they're inconsistent, SpaceX is the only solution. But then SpaceX is just going to [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1517.1999999999998s)]
*  advantage themselves. And there's nothing illegal about that. So you're going to be left with a [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1520.8799999999999s)]
*  bunch of these existing telecommunications companies in a really difficult spot in the [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1525.04s)]
*  next couple years. So it's going to be really dynamic space, I think very much worth paying [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1529.52s)]
*  attention to. Elon sends his regards to the all in community. He's taking a nap. Man has not slept [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1533.28s)]
*  in the last couple days. He's taking a well deserved nap right now. So hopefully, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1539.44s)]
*  we'll have him on in a future episode very quickly. Where are you taping from, J Cal? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1544.8799999999999s)]
*  Just curious, where are you taping from there? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1549.84s)]
*  I'm at Starbase. And there are little tiny homes and Elon lent us one to stay in here. And yeah, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1551.44s)]
*  it's just inspiring to be here. It's been a great experience. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1559.92s)]
*  And I've been here a couple times. And the scale of the factory, the ships, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1565.12s)]
*  and just over the last, like they said, the last, I've been here a couple times, maybe three or [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1571.84s)]
*  four years ago, it really is growing exponentially. And the other really positive thing is, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1575.76s)]
*  people are driving, again, back to the enthusiasm in the public. And what you don't see mirrored in [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1582.72s)]
*  the press, which I think was a really astute point, Sachs, I met a guy who gave me a ride in his golf [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1589.12s)]
*  court. I was I was late to a meeting guy says, Hey, are you going somewhere? And I said, Yeah, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1595.12s)]
*  because I was literally running down the street trying to catch a flight. And the guy drives me [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1599.76s)]
*  in his golf court. And I say, Hey, he says, Hey, you're here for the launch? I said, Yeah, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1604.0s)]
*  I'm here for the launch. He says, So am I. I said, Can I ask you? Do you work for SpaceX? He says, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1607.52s)]
*  No, I'm just a fan of Elon's. I'm a fan of SpaceX. And I said, Can I ask you drove from his I drove [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1612.8s)]
*  19 hours to somewhere in Texas, Houston, or something. He drove 19 hours to come here to [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1616.96s)]
*  spend the week to see the launch. And the crowds here have gotten bigger and bigger. And there's [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1621.2s)]
*  hundreds of people. I think it costs San Padre Island over here, their little beach community, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1626.72s)]
*  kind of like a Las Vegas on the beach or Reno or New Orleans. And they're just lined up there [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1632.8s)]
*  with cameras. These are Americans. Just Americans in RVs, in cars, setting up cameras to see history [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1639.36s)]
*  have. And it really is truly inspiring. These are just salt of the earth, normal folk. This isn't the [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1648.96s)]
*  media. This isn't like affluent people or necessarily, they're just Americans who are [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1656.0s)]
*  inspired. And then that's, I think, what all entrepreneurs who hear these stories about what's [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1662.16s)]
*  going on down here, you'll overestimate what you can do in a year, you're going to underestimate [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1668.0s)]
*  what you can do in 10. And I think that's, you know, we all know, you know, pretty well here and [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1671.28s)]
*  have watched this journey. They're cooking with oil, they're moving fast. And the iteration process [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1675.28s)]
*  is extraordinary. And they're making everything here. And it's Americans making everything that [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1680.8s)]
*  the tiles I remember being here three years ago, and Elon and I have two in the morning, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1686.1599999999999s)]
*  we're walking through the factory while where they were working 24 hours a day trying to figure out [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1691.36s)]
*  the tiles on Starship to get it back in. And they were making the tiles themselves. And just trying [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1694.8799999999999s)]
*  to figure that format that that's the level of detail that's occurring here. And as Gavin said, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1701.68s)]
*  there's 1000 different things changing on each iteration of this. So more great stuff to come, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1705.84s)]
*  I believe. Yeah. That's been another episode of Phil Helmuth mentions his relationship with Elon. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1712.24s)]
*  Thanks everybody for tuning in. No, I mean, what am I supposed to do? You know, like, I'm sorry [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1718.48s)]
*  that my friend, you know, started a rocket ship company, I don't want to apologize for it. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1725.12s)]
*  You guys doing great stuff in the world as well. So do we want to talk about AI? Do we want to go [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1730.72s)]
*  to this tiger marking down their book? Where would you like to go gentlemen, we can talk about [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1735.04s)]
*  the Fox settlement with dominion. That was something you and I talked about last week, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1738.8799999999999s)]
*  sex, I'd love to get your opinion on that. They paid $787 million in this settlement [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1744.1599999999999s)]
*  for defamation. It didn't go to trial. You were hoping it would go to trial. How do you feel? I [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1749.92s)]
*  mean, and this is an extraordinarily large settlement. So yeah, but what are your what [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1755.36s)]
*  are your thoughts on this? You wanted to see this go to the man go to the Supreme Court and maybe [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1760.6399999999999s)]
*  see the laws in the United States change eventually. Catch us up on your reaction to this [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1763.52s)]
*  ginormous fine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's funny you call it a speeding ticket because when I saw [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1768.48s)]
*  this reminded me of a scene at the beginning of apocalypse now, where Martin Sheen says that [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1775.84s)]
*  charging a man with murder in this place is like handing out speeding tickets at the Indianapolis [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1781.52s)]
*  500. I mean, the analogy here is that the media is so dishonest, whether it's CNN or MSNBC, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1785.52s)]
*  or the New York Times, I mean, or are constantly inaccurate or whatever. And, you know, so [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1793.36s)]
*  still defending Fox. So for this one network to get a fine of like 800 million, it's like pretty, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1799.52s)]
*  pretty incredible. I mean, they should be handing out a lot more of these in my in my view, not just [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1804.6399999999999s)]
*  to Fox. But yeah, look, I would like to see to that end, I would like to see the standard in [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1809.04s)]
*  New York Times versus Sullivan revised by the Supreme Court, the standard is actual malice. So [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1814.8799999999999s)]
*  you have to prove not just that the press told a lie, but that there was malice behind it. And [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1820.0s)]
*  that's what this trial would have been about. And Fox, so what should it change to? Yeah. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1826.48s)]
*  I think that change to what would be a better standard in your mind. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1832.8s)]
*  I think that if the media makes a mistake, they should have to correct it. And I would say the [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1837.2s)]
*  correction needs to be at the same level that they publicize the original story. So if they [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1843.04s)]
*  make a mistake, if it's untruthful, and it damages someone's reputation, and they refuse to post a [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1848.96s)]
*  correction, then I think they should be liable. That seems fair to me. If you were to put something [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1855.04s)]
*  on page a one, if you were to give it five minutes at the start of a show on whether it's Rachel [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1860.56s)]
*  Matto or Tucker, whoever makes the mistake can be anybody. If they made the mistake in the first [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1865.92s)]
*  five minutes top of the show, they don't get to bury down the website, they don't get to bury it [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1870.96s)]
*  on page seven. They got to say it up front. Hey, listen, we made a mistake. Correct. Here's the [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1874.4s)]
*  mistake. Yeah, I think it's reasonable. correction should get same publicity as the original story. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1878.5600000000002s)]
*  And by the way, if they correct it, that would be like a safe harbor. But if they refuse, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1884.24s)]
*  and they publish a lie, and it damages somebody, then they should be liable for that. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1888.48s)]
*  I think there should also be some that's what I think. But yeah, I'm in agreement with that, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1893.1200000000001s)]
*  because there is the trick in journalism to bury the correction. And there's another trick that [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1896.5600000000002s)]
*  I think needs to be looked at. It's a little more nuanced, which is somebody makes a mistake, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1902.32s)]
*  or an accusation in a publication. And then the next publication says, Oh, the New York Times, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1909.2s)]
*  Fox News, CNN said this, but they don't check it themselves. So they're using another publication [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1915.36s)]
*  as like a proxy to kind of give them some level of protection. I think they should have to on a [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1922.56s)]
*  firsthand basis. Right? No, that's the game they play. You're right. So they start with a super [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1926.6399999999999s)]
*  shady source. Yeah, that, you know, it just attributes it to some sort of anonymous source, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1931.8400000000001s)]
*  then the second most shady publication quotes that one. And then the third most shady quotes that and [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1937.1200000000001s)]
*  then it goes through the whole food chain. Yeah. So you're right, reposting something in the echo [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1943.76s)]
*  chamber, because other publications are doing it. You're right, that shouldn't not be protected. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1948.56s)]
*  They should have to do their own sourcing, basically. Yeah, or just some base level of [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1952.64s)]
*  fact checking if you and now if if you called it Fox opinion, that's slightly different than [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1956.24s)]
*  calling it Fox News. So maybe the part of this is branding a Chamath or Freiburg Germany thoughts [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1961.28s)]
*  on this. Just in general, Fox, I think has only 4 billion in cash. So they just spent 20 some [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1965.68s)]
*  odd percent of it paying this off. And if I were a shareholder, the question I would ask is, did we [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1972.0s)]
*  actually make enough money to justify having to pay almost $800 million of our cash balance? The [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1976.96s)]
*  answer is probably no. And this is the first of a bunch of lawsuits that they have. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1981.52s)]
*  The next one, which is I think is like Smartomatic, which is another voting machine company, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1988.16s)]
*  that's an even bigger lawsuit, actually, that's a two and a half billion dollar lawsuit. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1993.28s)]
*  And so it's going to be the same outcome and another settlement. And so now all of a sudden, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=1997.6s)]
*  you would deplete half their cash, all for a lie to do what at some point, some smart business [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2004.08s)]
*  governance needs to kick in over at Fox and they need to realize that this stuff just doesn't make [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2010.24s)]
*  economic sense. Maybe they thought it made political and ratings sense, but you can't justify [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2016.32s)]
*  that when it costs $2 billion. There's a concept here, I think, Sachs, that is particularly [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2021.92s)]
*  interesting in Finland. When you get a speeding ticket, speaking of speeding tickets, your [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2026.96s)]
*  speeding ticket is proportional to your net worth. And so these NHL players who like to speed and a [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2032.0s)]
*  Nokia executive was given the equivalent and this is a bit excessive of $103,000 fine for going 45 [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2038.32s)]
*  into 30 zone on his motorcycle. And an NHL player got a $39,000 fine two years earlier. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2044.6399999999999s)]
*  I think that this is part of the problem is sometimes fines don't match the crime and or [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2051.2s)]
*  the they're not proportional enough for the person to feel them. And so then we kind of can joke [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2056.08s)]
*  that they're speeding tickets, one very rich person said to me, you know, when they would [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2062.0s)]
*  watch them parking, you know, incredibly illegally in a small town. And I said, you're going to get [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2066.8s)]
*  a pretty serious ticket. That's in some pretty gnarly spot to be parking. And they said, Oh, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2072.72s)]
*  you mean the VIP parking charge? And I was like, Yeah, that kind of sucks. But okay. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2077.52s)]
*  There might be some concept here of proportional fine. And I think the EU is starting to work on [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2083.44s)]
*  that as well. Because, you know, big tech was ignoring this is going to embolden a lot of [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2090.72s)]
*  people to take matters into their own hands and sue some of these media companies if the lie is [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2096.4s)]
*  egregious enough. And it negatively impacts them enough, I think it would embolden a lot of folks. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2101.6s)]
*  So, Sachs is right that up until now, most folks haven't done anything about this. But [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2106.48s)]
*  if you feel like the media has really wronged you in a meaningful way, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2112.32s)]
*  there's probably also now a lot of private equity organizations that would do the lawsuit finance [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2118.0s)]
*  or hedge funds that would do the lawsuit finance. And so now you're like you're free rolling it, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2124.72s)]
*  right? So you get one of these folks to pay it, they get 50% of the gains, you get 25%, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2129.8399999999997s)]
*  the lawyers get 25% and you go and you litigate. I'm sure that you'll see more not less because [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2134.7999999999997s)]
*  this fine is really big. And again, we don't know the end of all of these 2020 election hoax [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2140.9599999999996s)]
*  shenanigans because this is the first not the last of these. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2147.2s)]
*  I do think it's a really big number. I mean, I did want the case to go to all these courts so [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2150.0s)]
*  they could revise New York Times versus Sullivan. But I do wonder about the size of the settlement [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2156.88s)]
*  here. It seems extraordinary. They paid it. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2161.76s)]
*  There was an interesting- It's a settlement. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2164.32s)]
*  Yeah, they voluntarily agreed to do it. Yeah, absolutely. So in any event, look, I hope [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2166.16s)]
*  Chamath is right that this actually incentivizes more actions against media companies because I [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2172.16s)]
*  think their feet need to be held to the fire and they need to do a better job publishing the truth. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2176.88s)]
*  There was an interesting thread by a Twitter poster called Kanakoa. I don't know if you guys [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2181.6800000000003s)]
*  saw this. Where he posted an hour of footage by Democrats and Democratic groups and more [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2189.6s)]
*  Democrat leading political science experts questioning whether voting machines could be [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2199.52s)]
*  hacked. Basically, this idea that voting machines could be hacked is not an allegation that is [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2205.04s)]
*  unique to Fox. So apparently, there's evidence that Fox knew it was bogus, so they definitely [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2213.2799999999997s)]
*  should not have run with it. But I do wonder, hey, why shouldn't other people be liable for this too? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2219.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, I mean, the question is, I think those internal text messages between the hosts who [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2225.92s)]
*  knowingly knew it was false and then were doing it, I think that's why they took that settlement [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2230.8s)]
*  because 800 million or whatever or so is a lot less than 1.4 or 1.5. And so there is speculation [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2236.1600000000003s)]
*  that maybe- Clearly, they got some bad discovery. They got some discovery problems. But I'm just [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2241.44s)]
*  saying that these allegations about electronic voting machines being hackable or rigged, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2245.04s)]
*  this seems like an allegation that's been made. Well, that's actually interesting. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2252.0800000000004s)]
*  Not just in 2020, but it's been made multiple times by whichever side loses. And so I would [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2255.36s)]
*  wonder why more parties aren't liable for this. By the way, I never bought into those allegations. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2261.6800000000003s)]
*  I said so at the time. I thought they were bogus. I thought the whole Sidney Powell thing, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2268.32s)]
*  the release of the Kraken or whatever was ridiculous. So I don't feel too bad for Fox [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2272.88s)]
*  or anything like that. But it seems to me, like I'm saying, they're not the only one [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2278.32s)]
*  speeding here. There's a lot of people who need to get speeding tickets. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2282.4s)]
*  Yeah. There is a roadmap for the press to learn from this and to get better, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2285.6s)]
*  right? Like to maybe take to heart that maybe the public now is looking at them and assuming [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2289.84s)]
*  the trust in media is at an all-time low. Alex Jones got fined a billion dollars, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2296.64s)]
*  right? It's a judgment. Judgment, yeah. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2301.28s)]
*  Judgment. The Fox thing's a settlement, right? He got a judgment of over a billion from multiple [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2303.28s)]
*  courts. Yeah. So he said a bunch of stuff that was in court provable to be false. And then he [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2308.32s)]
*  restated it and he got this massive fine. I think there's an interesting question here [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2315.52s)]
*  on how far this goes with respected... Maybe it invites the lawsuits, like you guys say, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2321.6800000000003s)]
*  where there's things that are more on the line. And then we really start to have a tough set of [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2329.2000000000003s)]
*  conversations that maybe there are things that are factually debatable, arguable, opinionated, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2334.4s)]
*  or they were true at a certain point and then you didn't really have evidence to disprove it. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2340.4s)]
*  What are you allowed to say? Are you only allowed to say things that you've proven or things that [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2344.8s)]
*  haven't been disproven? And that becomes a pretty tough set of conversations. And what I think might [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2348.08s)]
*  be interesting from here, if so much of media over time gets replaced by chat and AI aggregating lots [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2351.92s)]
*  of different information, synthesizing that and making representations back to us, and that becomes [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2359.04s)]
*  our primary source of call it news or media in the future. What happens when those models or [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2363.84s)]
*  the synthesis of data or the source of the data leads to a statement that has a similar descent [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2371.28s)]
*  around whether or not it's true or not? And that you really end up ending up in a pretty cloudy [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2377.2000000000003s)]
*  environment by starting this process. Yeah. I think as a very insightful... We'll get to AI [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2382.08s)]
*  in a minute. I just... Coming from a journalism background myself and then becoming a commentator [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2388.4s)]
*  there really needs to be three or four very simple things that the media needs to do. Number one, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2394.2400000000002s)]
*  more fact checking. And number two, less anonymous sources. They were like too much on anonymous [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2400.0800000000004s)]
*  sources. And then there needs to be very clear delineation between what is a fact and what is [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2404.7200000000003s)]
*  an opinion. And the public is trying to sort this out. Is it Fox News is an opinion? And what you're [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2410.0s)]
*  saying, is this an opinion or is this a fact? Did you do journalism or did you just have an opinion? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2415.6800000000003s)]
*  Is Rachel Maddow an opinion or did she actually have a journalist check these facts? [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2420.48s)]
*  And I think this is where self-policing and maybe rebuilding their rebuilding trust is on the media. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2424.56s)]
*  It is now the news and the media's job to rebuild trust. And if not, they're going to get more [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2430.96s)]
*  fines. But let's get into, I think some of the stuff we're seeing with AI. We had talked on this [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2436.16s)]
*  show before many times about the corpus of data under which these models are being built. Reddit [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2440.96s)]
*  announced plans to start charging companies that use this data training and models. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2448.4s)]
*  The co-founder Steve Huffman, who came back after Conde Nast had bought Reddit and then sold it back [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2453.04s)]
*  to the founders. And paradoxically, I believe Sam Altman has a major investment in Reddit. He said [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2459.28s)]
*  more than any other place on the internet, Reddit is a home for authentic conversations. There's a [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2464.56s)]
*  lot of stuff on the site that you'd only ever say in therapy AA or never at all. A lot of people use [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2468.56s)]
*  pseudonyms obviously, and the Reddit corpus of data is incredibly valuable, but we don't [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2473.36s)]
*  need to give all that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free, crawling Reddit, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2478.6400000000003s)]
*  generating revenue and not returning any of the value to our users is something we have a problem [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2485.52s)]
*  with. It's a good time for us to tighten things up. Your thoughts, Shamath, on what we talked about, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2489.92s)]
*  two different episodes. Maybe we'll play drop a clip in here, Nick, if you want to in post. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2496.08s)]
*  It's going to be the large data sets Quora, Yelp, the App Store reviews, Amazon's reviews. So there [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2500.16s)]
*  are large corpuses of data that you would need. Like Craigslist has famously never allowed anybody [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2505.6s)]
*  to scrape Craigslist. The amount of data inside Craigslist as but one example of a data set [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2510.72s)]
*  would be extraordinary to build chat GPT on. Chat GPT is not allowed to because as you brought up [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2515.92s)]
*  robots.txt last week, there's going to need to be an AI.txt. Are you allowed to use my data set in [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2521.2s)]
*  AI and under and how will I be compensated for it? Will the rights to the data will will Google [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2526.72s)]
*  just say to Quora, Hey, we'll give you a billion dollars a year for this data set. If you don't [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2534.64s)]
*  show anybody else, they should. Those were our previous discussions that we just played. What [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2538.7999999999997s)]
*  do you think? It's so incredible. We are witnessing such an important moment for [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2543.8399999999997s)]
*  Silicon Valley, but frankly, how the world works. And it's just everything is changing. That's what [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2550.32s)]
*  I'm just in awe about that. You know, we talked about this and we were basically spitballing [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2557.84s)]
*  something two or three months ago. And not but 60 or 90 days later, these things come to pass. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2562.7200000000003s)]
*  Right? We talked about something in one week. And then, you know, 14 days later, it's completely [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2570.32s)]
*  upended, like how impressed sax was about plugins. And then plugins were rendered useless, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2575.6s)]
*  and somewhat impotent two weeks later by auto GPTs. It's just so profound, I think what's going on. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2582.72s)]
*  So Google today announced that they're going to merge two organizations that I thought were so [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2589.92s)]
*  orthogonal to each other, disparate brain and deep mind. The cultures just seem so totally [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2596.7999999999997s)]
*  different. But now they're merging those two things together, something that I thought would [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2603.28s)]
*  never happen. They did it. So all these competitive pressures are so real. I was in LA for the [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2607.44s)]
*  breakthrough prize. I was flying home with somebody on Saturday, I won't say who it is, but they are [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2614.0800000000004s)]
*  right at the bleeding edge of a lot of this AI stuff. And they let go a third of their company [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2620.0s)]
*  replaced it with an agent within six weeks of training. So how is this not going to affect [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2625.76s)]
*  everybody else, I guess is maybe the bigger question. And then I go back to what I said last [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2635.84s)]
*  week, which is that we've talked about a lot of the positive things. And I think it's important [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2641.36s)]
*  to make sure that people understand that there are a bunch of non trivial negative things. And [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2645.6800000000003s)]
*  I think I shared one on Twitter, which was around this company that use an AI model to build a [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2650.2400000000002s)]
*  library of 40,000 toxic compounds that could kill all kinds of numbers of humans. So there's [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2654.56s)]
*  all kinds of really, really tough things going on right now that I think, to me means it's the [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2660.4s)]
*  moment where I have the least sense of how to do my job. And so I've tried to kind of like put a [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2665.12s)]
*  pin in everything and just go back to learning mode. It's a bit humbling is what you're saying, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2672.56s)]
*  like it's incredibly humbling the entire rulebook, even for us as capital allocators, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2676.24s)]
*  company formation. It has you, it has you Chamath, wondering how to do this. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2680.32s)]
*  As a CEO, I'm like, should I be using models to do parts of the workflow inside of my business? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2686.0s)]
*  Inside the portfolio companies that we're invested in? Am I supposed to go into the [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2693.76s)]
*  board meeting now on Monday and say, hey, XYZ person just did one, two and three, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2698.0s)]
*  and cut OPEX by a third. Do I demand the CEO do that? Do I force change if they don't do it? [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2703.84s)]
*  Do I say, so I don't, I don't, I don't exactly know what to do. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2711.68s)]
*  The carousel is spinning increasingly faster and we're all on it. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2716.8s)]
*  I'll just say a general point, which I kind of made at this event today. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2720.24s)]
*  It feels like the pace of change is so high that you're kind of in a dust storm. You don't really [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2727.12s)]
*  know where you're going to end up. So it's very hard to sit as an investor right now and say, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2731.6s)]
*  I'm going to pick these things because two weeks later, you just don't know whether that path even [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2735.84s)]
*  exists anymore because the dust storm washes it away, blows it away. And I think that [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2741.52s)]
*  as a result, there will be a lot of money lost by investors, by companies building in this space. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2750.0s)]
*  Net, the index for investing in like dot-com companies, the majority, a large amount of money [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2756.24s)]
*  was lost during that era. But from that era also emerged a handful of winners. And those winners [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2763.7599999999998s)]
*  ended up creating extraordinary value. I think we're at a point in time right now where we could [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2772.0s)]
*  see 10 times the value generated in this phase of technology advancement than we saw during the [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2775.9199999999996s)]
*  internet and the advancement of the internet. And if that is true, I think you'll end up seeing [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2781.2s)]
*  certainly the same thing happen, which is the index will lose money, but the few winners will [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2786.64s)]
*  accrue such extraordinary gains. The problem is you can't deterministically pick those winners [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2791.9199999999996s)]
*  today because of the dust storm problem. You just don't know the path. So if you were to meet Jeff [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2797.2s)]
*  Bezos versus some CEO of some dot-com selling pet stores, you're going to lose money. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2802.64s)]
*  Dot-com selling pet stuff back in 1995 to 97, 94 to 97, would you have recognized Jeff Bezos was [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2810.0s)]
*  going to stand out? Would you have recognized Larry and Sergey were going to stand out? Would [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2817.2000000000003s)]
*  you have recognized Bill Gates was going to stand out or Zuck? At the end of the day, this is harder [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2820.4s)]
*  than it has ever been in terms of predicting a technology cycle. But what we still know to be true [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2825.6000000000004s)]
*  is that the capital will be allocated within a company, the operations will be run, managed, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2832.08s)]
*  and driven and led by an individual or a set of individuals. And that's effectively what I think [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2837.2s)]
*  a lot of investing in the cycle is going to come down to. We're all going to sit here and pontificate [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2841.8399999999997s)]
*  and intellectually masturbate ourselves to some genius path that we think is going to evolve. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2846.16s)]
*  And at the end of the day, most of it won't turn out to be true and that path won't be real, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2851.4399999999996s)]
*  because this is such a dynamical system right now. There are so many feedback loops. One thing makes [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2855.2799999999997s)]
*  one step change and it changes every other step. But what we still know is that great leaders [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2859.9199999999996s)]
*  can lead. And especially coming out of this Elon discussion and seeing the extraordinary achievements [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2865.04s)]
*  he's delivered particularly today, I think that's maybe what a lot of early stage venture is going [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2872.1600000000003s)]
*  to shift to in AI. It's really finding great people. And I'll tell you one thing for sure, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2877.44s)]
*  and I was commenting on this earlier today, was I really think a lot of series C and later companies, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2883.28s)]
*  and I know we're going to talk about this implosion discussion later, so many of those companies have [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2889.28s)]
*  a valuation that's less than their preference stack. And as a result, those founders that work [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2893.84s)]
*  there and those employees that are there are getting their equity wiped out. They'll have to [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2899.76s)]
*  get restructured. Can you just explain what that means technically to the audience? [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2904.4s)]
*  When you raise money into a startup, the investors that give you that money, that invest that money, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2909.36s)]
*  it's effectively a loan. You owe them that money back first before your shares get paid out in the [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2915.44s)]
*  future. So if the company ends up being worth less than the money that they've invested, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2921.68s)]
*  they get the money first. And ultimately, if the company goes public or gets sold, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2926.24s)]
*  they can convert their what are called preferred shares into common shares and participate. So [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2931.8399999999997s)]
*  even though you only quote sold 20% of your company for let's say $200 million, that $200 million [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2936.64s)]
*  actually has to get paid first. So now you've raised this $200 million, the investors, the [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2943.7599999999998s)]
*  company is now repriced because the market has come down by 80%. And investors are saying, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2949.2s)]
*  Hey, your company is now worth 175 million. Your company is now worth less than what you owe [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2954.08s)]
*  the prior the product, the preferred investors. And if it's worth less than what you owe, which [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2959.52s)]
*  I think is the case for over 70 or 80% of series C and layer companies, you know, we can kind of, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2964.48s)]
*  yeah, and this, but this number comes from what I shared a few months ago, which is that 70% of [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2970.48s)]
*  publicly traded companies that went public in the last three years are trading below the cash that [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2976.72s)]
*  they've raised. So if you translate that on a one to one basis to the private market, you know, and [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2981.12s)]
*  these, by the way, were the best companies actually got public. So in the private market, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2985.8399999999997s)]
*  you've got to assume that something in that late stage market is on the order of 70 80% [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2989.68s)]
*  is worth less than their preference stack. So a lot of those employees are going to run. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2993.9199999999996s)]
*  Those founders don't want to go work for the VCs when they get recapped and get offered a 4% [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=2998.3199999999997s)]
*  equity grant. Because it looks like they're going to start AI companies. And I think that's fantastic. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3001.8399999999997s)]
*  And I think that's what's really shifting it right now. And that's kind of a big dynamic [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3007.12s)]
*  is a lot of these I'm calling them zombie corns are going to see this kind of mass exodus of talent. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3011.3599999999997s)]
*  And a lot of the investors that don't know how to price stuff and don't want to deal with recaps in [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3017.2799999999997s)]
*  the late stage are diverting their attention to seed and a and early stuff. And so there's both a [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3021.3599999999997s)]
*  rush of talent and a rush of capital to this kind of very early stage. And so we'll create this [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3026.56s)]
*  massively bubble iffic, you know, index of AI stuff. But some number of these things with some [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3031.84s)]
*  great leaders will emerge and will accrue extraordinary value across many industries. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3038.32s)]
*  Greg Foss I really agree with a lot of what you're saying. The thing to keep in mind is that the [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3042.56s)]
*  problem with the use of auto GPTs as an example is that the order of magnitude of capital that you [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3047.36s)]
*  need has now just gone down. Yeah, yeah, instead of a $10 million Series A. So we used to, you know, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3053.36s)]
*  people in the height, we're doing 30 and $40 million Series A's into crazy, very [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3059.12s)]
*  bubble ish ideas and NFTs and all this other stuff. That's idiotic today. Because a two or [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3065.7599999999998s)]
*  three person company can now do the work of 20 to 30 people. And the amount of capital that they need [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3073.92s)]
*  is really their salaries, plus the cost of renting some GPUs on your favorite picture cloud. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3080.16s)]
*  And so all of a sudden, you can get huge amounts of progress in weeks and months, with hundreds of [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3088.88s)]
*  1000s or low millions of dollars. So if you've raised all of a sudden, a $5 billion fund, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3094.88s)]
*  because you were trying to do late stage deals. And now all of a sudden said, Well, wait, we'll [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3101.6000000000004s)]
*  just pivot to early stage. But what are you going to do find the next 30 person company, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3106.1600000000003s)]
*  that's not going to work, because you have to know how to write 500,000 to million dollar checks with [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3110.8s)]
*  two or three people, and, and really, and really help them and really understand their technical [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3115.68s)]
*  ability to execute, right. But then it also quickly becomes a thing where maybe you're better off [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3121.9199999999996s)]
*  just doing 500, these two and three person teams. We tried this experiment. Seven years ago, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3128.3199999999997s)]
*  this thing called capital as a service where we were doing this automated investing, I don't know [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3136.0s)]
*  if you guys remember this, but it was like some machine learning that we did on all of our [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3140.24s)]
*  portfolio companies. And all somebody had to do was fill out a form and send us some metrics, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3143.6s)]
*  and we would have a machined decision, right. So humans would not be allowed to make the [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3148.96s)]
*  investment decision. The problem that we ran into was there was a lot of great companies [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3153.2s)]
*  all around the world. But the administrative burden of supporting 500 companies was unbelievably [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3157.36s)]
*  large and complicated. Oh, you have a company in Indonesia, well, there's another company in South [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3164.96s)]
*  Korea, and here's a company in, you know, they're raising a new round, they have to get [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3170.0s)]
*  board approval, they got to do this signatures. I mean, it's hard to scale. Yeah, so it's sort of [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3174.0s)]
*  the VC, which is a software light people heavy artisanal business, all of a sudden becomes [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3178.48s)]
*  misfactored, right. So you actually need to be highly automated and use software yourself in [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3184.72s)]
*  order to put 503 person teams on the field. So this is what I mean by it's really, I think free birds [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3190.16s)]
*  use of the term dust storm is a really good one. It's extremely, extremely confusing what to do. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3198.3199999999997s)]
*  And if you have large amounts of money, that may actually now what used to be a real differentiator [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3204.16s)]
*  and a key to success may actually become an impediment because you get to burst, you are [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3211.6s)]
*  forced to do business in a classical way that has changed, frankly, in the last 90 days. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3218.3199999999997s)]
*  What do you think, Sax? [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3225.36s)]
*  What's the question because we're touching a lot of different things here. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3226.88s)]
*  Do you feel like this is a dust storm and it's murky and it's just hard to place bets as a capital [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3229.12s)]
*  allocator? Because something comes out the next day, or 48 hours later, or the next week that takes [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3235.12s)]
*  the previous idea and wipes it out and then how do you scale and be capital efficient? [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3242.56s)]
*  Well, we're at the early stages of a huge new wave. And I think that creates a lot of opportunity. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3248.0s)]
*  So yeah, you've got to basically separate what's really interesting from the fool's gold. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3253.44s)]
*  There's definitely going to be a lot of that. But at least there's a reason now to believe that, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3258.7200000000003s)]
*  say, dozens of unicorns could be created in the next couple of years. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3265.68s)]
*  So before we were getting kind of long in the tooth on some of these tech cycles. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3269.28s)]
*  I mean, cloud, social, mobile. I mean, there was a reason to believe that those earlier [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3273.28s)]
*  waves had sort of played out that the big winner has already been determined. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3278.08s)]
*  And maybe there wouldn't be too many more big winners in those spaces. But now we have a whole [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3281.44s)]
*  new catalyst for founders to do all sorts of new things. And so I kind of think that's super [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3286.56s)]
*  exciting. We're in the early stages. And I do think there will be [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3293.12s)]
*  dozens of new unicorns minted in various aspects of AI. It could be in AI infrastructure. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3297.36s)]
*  Whether you're seeing now there's a lot of funding that's gone into [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3305.76s)]
*  vector databases or platforms for creating agents. Or it could be in AI copilots, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3308.8s)]
*  basically that tackle various professional categories and create a copilot for coders [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3315.76s)]
*  or copilot for doctors or lawyers or architects. I think there's going to be [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3321.36s)]
*  potentially multiple unicorns created in those categories. I think there's going to be [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3326.16s)]
*  SaaS software products that were just good before, but now will actually be great [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3333.2000000000003s)]
*  because the incorporation of API's from AI foundation models will just turbocharge the [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3337.6000000000004s)]
*  capabilities. And so there's a whole bunch of SaaS products that I think become newly interesting [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3345.36s)]
*  and better. They go from being vitamins to painkillers. So we're looking at all those [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3352.0s)]
*  categories and I think we'll end up making some bets. But there's also going to be a lot of [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3357.76s)]
*  companies that are flashes in the pan or get undermined. There'll be SaaS companies that [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3362.08s)]
*  actually become less attractive because of disruption from AI. But look, I think all of [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3368.4s)]
*  this, this maelstrom is great for an investor. I mean, if you're going to spray and pray, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3373.52s)]
*  it's not good. You've got to be selective about where you take your shots. But I think this is [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3378.08s)]
*  the most exciting environment we've been in in a number of years. I mean, it makes me want to go [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3383.52s)]
*  to work every day and see. It's so funny you say that, Sachs, because I literally am looking for [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3389.68s)]
*  an office space in San Mateo to start doing the incubator in person again. And on Monday, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3395.2s)]
*  I'm having 60 companies come to San Francisco and we'll be at my attorney's office and we're [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3401.04s)]
*  having a founder university with just all these new startups that we invested in to just hang out [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3406.3199999999997s)]
*  for a day. The enthusiasm right now is amazing. And what's really unique is the developers who had [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3411.12s)]
*  three out of seven companies they interviewed with offer them 150 or 250k packages, RSUs, whatever. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3419.8399999999997s)]
*  Now there's no offer from Facebook. There's no Apple. There's no Twitter. There's no Google [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3426.3999999999996s)]
*  or Microsoft offer coming in to be the backstop against starting a company. So what are they doing? [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3432.08s)]
*  They're saying, you know what? I got two friends who got laid off. I got one friend who's halfway [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3438.08s)]
*  out the door. Let's just start something. Let's just start something. Who can give me 100k? Who [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3441.8399999999997s)]
*  can give me 500k? And it's so invigorating to see the talented people, not people who've learned how [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3445.6s)]
*  to hack a pitch deck together and tell a story, but people who are actually coding and making MVPs. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3454.72s)]
*  It's truly exhilarating right now, the amount of two and three person startups I'm seeing. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3461.92s)]
*  And so while you'll have this, and it's an incredible, I've never seen this amount of [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3467.8399999999997s)]
*  destruction and creation occurring simultaneously. I love this zombie concept. You have one half of [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3472.48s)]
*  your portfolio coming apart at the seams, layoffs, reducing their targets, while people are coming in [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3479.12s)]
*  the door with products that are absolutely awe inspiring. I just give one example. I had a [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3485.84s)]
*  company come out of our founder university, I gave them $25,000 to incorporate a developer and his [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3491.28s)]
*  brother who's a screenplay writer. They're taking screenplay writing software sacks that you'll [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3495.76s)]
*  appreciate this having produced two amazing movies. Thank you for smoking and the Dolly film [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3499.6s)]
*  is called Dolly land. Dolly land. Yeah, coming out in two months. Coming out two months. Congratulations [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3503.04s)]
*  to Emmy award winning Oscar winning producer. I was gonna win an Oscar this time. He's [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3510.48s)]
*  you know, the screenplay writing tools that have existed. They're like what word processors with [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3517.12s)]
*  formatting. What they're doing is they're saying, hey, write some dialogue. And then you can have [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3521.04s)]
*  dialogue and say, hey, make it a little snappier, make it a little Tarantino ish, make it a little [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3526.8s)]
*  more, you know, Sorkin ish, and then make a storyboard with, you know, stable diffusion. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3531.2000000000003s)]
*  And I was like, well, this is the genius idea. I mean, it's unbelievable. Of course, I'll give [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3538.4s)]
*  you $25,000 for your incorporation. And then they're coming to the accelerator, give another 100k. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3542.0s)]
*  And in every single piece of software, well, that company in success ever raised 25 or $30 million, [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3546.88s)]
*  do you think? No, I think there'll be 12 people. I think it'll be 12 people. I'll give them [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3553.28s)]
*  100k and then our industry raises $100 billion a year on the premise that each company before [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3558.8s)]
*  they become a unicorn will absorb between 500 and a billion dollars. Yeah, no, I'm going to own [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3565.28s)]
*  20% 10 to 20% of the company for low millions. And, and we'll see mid journey is 12 people and [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3571.36s)]
*  no, it's totally bootstrapped. Like, I guess what I'm saying is, because in the world of AI, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3577.92s)]
*  so much work is done for you for free. This is why I'm asking, maybe we will have to change how [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3583.52s)]
*  we do business on the Hollywood example, there's about to be a writer's guild strike. And they may [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3589.36s)]
*  want to think twice about that, because this is not the time where you want to be encouraging the [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3594.48s)]
*  industry to find alternatives to writers. You want to get back in the office and you want to say, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3599.6800000000003s)]
*  Hey, can I could, is there any other work I can do this weekend boss? Did you see the news about [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3604.56s)]
*  BuzzFeed today? They had one a Pulitzer, they just shut down BuzzFeed News, the entire news [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3608.7999999999997s)]
*  division gone, another 15% gone, the layoffs. And then there was a report this week that Zuckerberg [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3614.0s)]
*  is doing his third round of layoffs, another 4000 people that puts him at 24,000. Yeah, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3620.08s)]
*  with a hiring freeze. So the way I describe the current funding environment is it's a tale of two [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3626.7999999999997s)]
*  cities. It's the best of times, it's the worst of times. If you're a hot AI startup that's able to [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3631.68s)]
*  tap into the zeitgeist, that's doing something that's perceived as cutting edge or relevant, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3638.3999999999996s)]
*  there's a strong why now and you're early, you know, you're early stage, you're able to raise [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3643.44s)]
*  money for that. The spigot has turned back on, there's a lot of funding for those types of early [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3648.3199999999997s)]
*  stage startups. But if you're a series C stage startup, you're a late stage startup, with a, [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3653.44s)]
*  it's called a pre AI model. The spigot is just turned off completely. I mean, let's look at that [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3658.8s)]
*  chart from French base where the amount of series C funding has gone from something like 10 billion [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3664.32s)]
*  a quarter last year to like zero. I mean, this is hardly, I thought this was an error in the chart. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3672.1600000000003s)]
*  Look at this chart, everybody is serious, see funding to us companies by quarter, there is [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3680.7200000000003s)]
*  just no growth stage funding is just completely dried up. I mean, look at that. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3684.64s)]
*  I mean, it got cut in a half, and then it got cut in half again. And then it just flatlined. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3690.08s)]
*  So when you see this, is your thesis, let me ask you this, is your thesis here that people aren't [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3696.8799999999997s)]
*  trying to raise money, and they're just busy cutting their companies down to a smaller team [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3701.12s)]
*  size, and they'll come back out in the second half of the year, or that anybody with that amount of [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3705.6s)]
*  dry powder is out of the game now? Yeah, I think that we're in this awkward stage where [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3710.56s)]
*  the, the companies who raise money and call it 2020 and 2021, all those valuations are obsolete. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3716.48s)]
*  And you've had a lot of late stage players leave the game, or they're in the penalty box, [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3723.92s)]
*  they're in timeout. I mean, look at Tiger, for example, the single most active funder at late [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3728.72s)]
*  stage is trying to figure out how much to mark down his portfolio. So I just think that a lot [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3733.36s)]
*  of the funding has dried up. This idea that there's tons of dry powder sitting out there, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3738.56s)]
*  I think is a myth. Or maybe it's there, but there's no willingness to deploy it. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3741.84s)]
*  The valuations are all out of whack. And VCs generally would rather lead around in a [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3746.08s)]
*  new startup with a fresh cap table than in a cap table they got to restructure because no one [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3753.84s)]
*  really wants to do restructuring work. Which is what we talked about a year ago. This is what [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3758.56s)]
*  we talked about a year ago, Chamath. I asked you point blank, would you, if they cut the valuation [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3760.96s)]
*  and, you know, they redid everything and said, Hey, listen, we understand this is reality, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3766.4s)]
*  would you get involved in cut a check? And you're like, I don't want to deal with that kind of, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3770.32s)]
*  you know, that kind of too hard bucket for you. And so now once again, a year, six months or a [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3774.32s)]
*  year after we talk about this, it has now manifested this is metastasized into no, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3781.2000000000003s)]
*  it hasn't even started. I think we are still started. Okay, I think I think we're still being [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3785.92s)]
*  really precious. Like, the tiger thing was very important, because they are in many ways, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3790.2400000000002s)]
*  at the front of the line, in terms of the number of companies, they've touched the amount of capital [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3795.7599999999998s)]
*  they've written. And because they're in the middle of a very large fundraise, their need to mark to [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3800.08s)]
*  market quite accurately, so that their existing LPs know what they're signing up for in this next [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3806.0s)]
*  fund. So they're the ones that have the most incentive to move the marks. But it still leaves [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3810.72s)]
*  an entire industry of folks that don't necessarily need to do that, because they have, whether it's [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3817.8399999999997s)]
*  dry powder, that dry powder is real or not. The point is that there's a lot of money that hasn't [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3823.68s)]
*  been deployed. And so again, I've asked this question before, what is their incentive to [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3827.68s)]
*  really mark their book down 50%? They don't have an incentive. Why would they do that? They would [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3832.3199999999997s)]
*  rather let it decay down naturally. I'll give you an example of this or do converts that keep it [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3837.12s)]
*  alive that basically allow them to delay? Yeah, but even the convert market free birth, that was [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3843.04s)]
*  hot for about six months. And then it just, nobody's doing that stuff either. But I'll give [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3847.8399999999997s)]
*  you one example. There's a very good company that we are investors in, along with every kind of big [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3851.92s)]
*  blue chip tier one, muckety muck organization, we did the A and they stacked on afterwards. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3859.6800000000003s)]
*  And when we thought about what our valuation should be, we did something, we got to a number, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3864.7200000000003s)]
*  which was a third of what the mark was. And we're like, well, if we think the price is two thirds [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3870.96s)]
*  off, we should probably just sell it now. And we actually went and got some term sheets from some [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3878.0s)]
*  private equity firms to validate it. And what they were was incredible. They both independently got to [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3884.16s)]
*  that same number. And so while the deal was closing, we went through the end of quarter, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3888.88s)]
*  we moved the mark down and we pointed to that valuation. And we said, look, this is what these [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3894.32s)]
*  two other very well known firms have said, this is what we've said. So this is what our new valuation [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3899.84s)]
*  is. And you know, we're trying to sell it and we ended up selling it. But every other organization [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3904.0s)]
*  didn't touch their valuation, that valuation. The private equity folks, maybe you could explain [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3908.16s)]
*  to the audience why the private equity folks are such a good backstop in terms of valuation [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3912.56s)]
*  versus say venture capitalists. Well, I think that venture capitalists, we tend to be glass half full. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3917.84s)]
*  And we are conditioned, especially if you do your job well, to be smart buyers of deep out of the [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3924.96s)]
*  money options. What does that mean? It's like when you meet an entrepreneur and you give them [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3933.52s)]
*  three or four million bucks or $500,000 or whatever, at some nominal valuation, you're not [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3937.04s)]
*  trying to get your money back. You're trying to figure out whether he is a Zuck or an Elon or [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3943.04s)]
*  Larry Page and all of a sudden you get 1000 X on your money back, right? So we are buying these deep [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3947.52s)]
*  out of the money options. Most of them don't hit. But when they do, they can just have these crazy [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3952.56s)]
*  statistical outlier outcomes. So we're trying to buy the future and we tend to be believers of [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3958.16s)]
*  what can go right. Private equity has refined a very powerful toolkit of putting two or three [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3965.7599999999998s)]
*  orders of magnitude of the money we put into companies to work on the premise that the glass [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3974.72s)]
*  is actually half empty and what can go wrong and how do we mitigate that risk. And so they tend to [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3979.2799999999997s)]
*  be much more sober, I think, in my experience dealing with them in what is the true valuation [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3985.28s)]
*  of a business? What are the upsides of a business? What are the warts on a business? They really kind [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3990.6400000000003s)]
*  of see the truth, the ground truth much better than VCs do in general. Because they're closer [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=3996.4s)]
*  to public markets and they flip these things every two or three years. Their margins are much [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4000.96s)]
*  thinner. They're trying to make 125, 1.6 X their money. 2X is a huge outcome for them. Yes. So they [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4005.36s)]
*  have a much more sober version of reality. A bunch of this tiger stuff got released and, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4012.96s)]
*  I mean, their funds underwater, just like Masi Yoshi San's fund is underwater. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4020.88s)]
*  And it's going to be years of pain and suffering to get out from under this. And so again, I think [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4025.52s)]
*  Sachs nailed it with tell of two cities. Anybody else want to chime on this before we talk a little [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4030.96s)]
*  bit about our friend of the pod, Brian Armstrong? I've been investing off balance sheet since 2018. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4035.52s)]
*  And six months ago, we started to explore whether we should raise a fund. And I think it was like [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4043.04s)]
*  two weeks ago, we brought the senior partners in me and the five other guys that run our business. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4048.48s)]
*  And we said, we're not going to raise a fund. And the biggest reason is this dynamic, which is that, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4053.52s)]
*  you know, we have dollars of private assets, I don't actually know what they're really worth. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4060.32s)]
*  But I have a responsibility to try to get as much of that capital out. And so I thought the best [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4067.36s)]
*  thing to do is just to take our time and try to figure it out. Because I have way more questions [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4071.84s)]
*  and answers right now. And that's really the first time since I've moved to Silicon Valley, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4078.56s)]
*  where I've had that sensation is a sensation humility. I think it's like, [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4082.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, I'm joking, but it is it is for somebody like you who has done so well placing bets, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4088.56s)]
*  deeply deeply, I mean, I say this joke, but I mean it as like a point of self awareness for you, [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4094.1600000000003s)]
*  because, listen, you play some amazing bets, whether it's the Warriors or Facebook, [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4099.84s)]
*  or Bitcoin or whatever, or Slack or whatever, I don't know whether I should be writing [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4104.72s)]
*  $200 million checks or $200,000 checks. And I don't know whether I should be doing that, [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4108.56s)]
*  sort of as an incubator, actually, as an accelerator, what I'm doing, or actually just [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4114.08s)]
*  as a series A detached investor. So I don't know, I'm trying to take the time to figure it out. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4119.76s)]
*  And my thought was, if I raise a fund right now, I could barely [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4125.12s)]
*  stand the idea of me putting money to work right now of my own capital without any answers. But [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4128.4800000000005s)]
*  then the idea of like having a bunch of sovereign wealth funds and folks that were ready to work [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4133.4400000000005s)]
*  with us. I don't know, I just, I just, not the right time. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4137.6s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Just to tell you my fundraising story, [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4141.92s)]
*  I am publicly raising launch fund for I get over $50 million in just, you know, high net [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4144.0s)]
*  worth individuals, you know, and family offices who are interested immediately close down to 26, [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4150.4800000000005s)]
*  27, 28 of it, and then I'm going to go out on the road to meet with LPs, and Silicon Valley [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4156.24s)]
*  bank blows up. Nobody can take a meeting that month, right? And so now, thank the Lord, I said, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4160.32s)]
*  I'm going to have a one year window to raise the fund. And I talked to some old school VCs, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4166.16s)]
*  Fred Wilson, Bill Gurley, these people would take a year to raise a fund. It used to be, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4171.599999999999s)]
*  or I'm sorry, in the height of this bubble, you tell me, a sax, the quick issue closed one of the [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4177.36s)]
*  Kraft's funds. But I was hearing people saying they're closing funds within two or three months. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4182.16s)]
*  I think we're back to it's a year on the road to close a fund. What's your experience, [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4186.72s)]
*  Saxon? And you're an all star. So I'm curious, the shortest to the reality. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4190.08s)]
*  Dave Korsunsky I think it's just depends on your situation, [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4194.08s)]
*  to be honest. But, but I think the important thing for founders to know is just that the way that [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4198.0s)]
*  late stage financing is dried up is very real. I'll give you like two data points just this week. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4205.12s)]
*  So I got my first notification from a portfolio company. This is a company I invested in before [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4209.6s)]
*  Kraft. It's not a Kraft investment, my personal investments. And they're doing a pay to play [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4215.52s)]
*  round. You know what that is? That means pain. Yeah. Yeah. So basically, the way it works is [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4220.320000000001s)]
*  they say they're going to raise $20 million. Well, by the way, they said they went out to raise [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4226.96s)]
*  growth funding. Weren't able to get a term sheet from anybody. And so no takers. And this is a [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4230.88s)]
*  good product. I mean, a lot of startups use this product. I think they're ARRs in the 20 something [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4238.32s)]
*  million, maybe 30 something million. It's not like doubling year over year, it's growing like, let's [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4244.719999999999s)]
*  call it 50% year over year. This is a company that should have been able to raise money. I don't [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4249.36s)]
*  understand why they weren't. Maybe because they're burning too much money. So instead of cutting costs [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4252.96s)]
*  the way they should, they're doing like a $20 million pay to play round. And what that means is [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4258.08s)]
*  that everybody who's an investor in the company, you either have to do your prorated share of the [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4262.48s)]
*  20 million or you get diluted 10 to one. If you had 10% of the company, you have to put in $2 million [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4267.68s)]
*  or your 10% of the company is now 1%. No, it'd be more because you would look at, let's say 50% [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4274.08s)]
*  of the companies owned by the investors and the other 50% is common. Just to take round numbers. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4281.04s)]
*  If you own 10% of the company, that would actually be 20% of the preferred. Yes. Yeah, [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4287.200000000001s)]
*  the employees are not buying shares in this. 20% of the 20 million. So it's 4 million. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4290.96s)]
*  So it's 4 million. Yeah, exactly. So basically you have to own 1%. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4295.76s)]
*  Right, right. So basically it's almost like a capital call where you just have to pony up [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4301.360000000001s)]
*  more money in order to preserve your ownership in the company. If it makes you feel better. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4306.8s)]
*  I had one of those just happen to me as well. And I was just like, we'll put in the bare minimum [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4313.84s)]
*  because like the thing that it puts you in, it paints you in a corner where you're like, well, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4318.320000000001s)]
*  I've been with this thing for eight or nine years. Is this the moment to basically lose all of that [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4321.52s)]
*  compounding or value or work that you put in or seen their team do? And it's just a really [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4329.6s)]
*  tough position. Right? Yeah. So look, I'm not on the board. So I don't know what reasoning went into [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4335.200000000001s)]
*  this, but what they should be sending out to all the shareholders is look, here are all of our [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4340.64s)]
*  metrics. Here's our burn. You know, here's the steps we took to reduce our burn. I don't really [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4345.360000000001s)]
*  like the idea of having to do essentially a capital call from your existing investors [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4350.88s)]
*  when you haven't reduced your own burn. I mean, why can't the company operate at break even if [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4354.8s)]
*  you're at 30 something million of ARR, you should be able to operate that you may not want to operate [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4359.84s)]
*  at break even, but you should be able to. But this is what I mean. I'll tell you after we [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4364.72s)]
*  stopped taping who it was that that told me this about their company, but they were basically able [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4368.72s)]
*  to let go a third of their workforce by moving a bunch of work to models. And let me guess the [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4374.24s)]
*  founders get to keep their shares or they get re-upped in this whole Michigan? No, no, no, [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4380.08s)]
*  but wait, hold on. Can we can I just finish the point? So the point is like, if you can cut [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4384.8s)]
*  off x by a third, by using all of these new AI, you know, models and GPTs and auto GPTs, what are [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4389.68s)]
*  you as a board member or shareholder supposed to do? And also, as a founder, don't you have to go [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4396.4s)]
*  there first before you start to ask people for more money? And why aren't people doing that first [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4403.5199999999995s)]
*  much more aggressively? And so this is what doesn't make any sense to me. That's exactly [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4409.6s)]
*  my point is what steps were taken to cut costs before you just went to the investors to pony up [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4413.52s)]
*  more money. That's what I want to know if they actually did that work. And this is like the last [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4418.160000000001s)]
*  money they need. Okay, then, you know, I'll pony up my share. By the way, we need investors. No, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4422.88s)]
*  we don't. And we need investors to be much more aggressive in holding folks accountable, because [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4429.120000000001s)]
*  these examples need to be better discussed. While effects y z company was able to do it, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4434.8s)]
*  why aren't you able to do it? And if it's because we're not technically capable, [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4439.76s)]
*  Matt, that's maybe a plausible answer. But even that reason will go away in a few months, I suspect. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4444.8s)]
*  But if it's that we just have such institutional rot, we're incapable of doing it. Well, then you [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4449.76s)]
*  might as well just not write the check because that company is going to get undercut by some new [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4454.88s)]
*  white sheet version of that business that doesn't have any of these impediments that [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4459.28s)]
*  management has told you about in a way, Chema and Sachs management has told you they're incapable [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4462.4s)]
*  of running this business, this concern in a in a thoughtful way. I had this happen to us as well. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4467.92s)]
*  And the question I have you Sachs is, in these situations where this pay to play happens, [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4473.679999999999s)]
*  you basically everybody gets wiped out except those who play. But the founders and the management [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4478.96s)]
*  team always seem to get re up and their whole because the new investor doesn't want the [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4484.639999999999s)]
*  management team not incentivize. So in these kind of situations, it's kind of like the management [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4488.4s)]
*  team gets to reboot the cap table, and they don't get penalized. I don't know. I actually I don't [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4494.24s)]
*  have those details yet. Yeah. Remember, I didn't lead around. I was just an angel investor in the [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4498.799999999999s)]
*  company. So I checked with one of the VC firms that led around and I'm like, are you going to [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4504.08s)]
*  do this? And they said probably not, you know. And so like the round might fail. I mean, they can make [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4509.2s)]
*  it as punitive as they want. But if the shareholders don't believe that the company has fixes problems, [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4514.96s)]
*  they're not going to pony up the money. Let's get free. Yeah, I think one of the problems that [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4522.08s)]
*  a lot of folks are facing is it becomes less about the fundamental value of a business in a lot of [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4527.04s)]
*  these conversations, as you guys know, and it's becoming a lot more about who will fund the next [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4535.92s)]
*  round if the company is still burning money. And so you're making a social market bet, not a bet on [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4541.28s)]
*  the team or the business or the value. It's that there's someone else that's going to lead the next [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4547.28s)]
*  round. And this is fundamentally why he's called the greater fool. That's called the greater fool. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4553.759999999999s)]
*  Look, I mean, it's historically we wouldn't call him a fool if it's just about progress [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4558.16s)]
*  towards profitability. But right now, there's so much trepidation, it's almost like a self-fulfilling [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4562.08s)]
*  prophecy that there's so much trepidation in doing late stage rounds that no one wants to be [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4567.28s)]
*  the last guy in because you're not sure if the next guy is going to be there to fund the last [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4571.92s)]
*  round to get to profitability. And that's why half of biotechs that are public are trading below cash [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4575.44s)]
*  because historically the way biotech companies, which is a really good pointed example of this, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4581.679999999999s)]
*  they make progress to hit milestones. And then the next round of capital comes in, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4586.8s)]
*  they make progress, hit milestones, next round of capital comes in. And then eventually you get [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4590.16s)]
*  phase three approvals and you go sell the company or whatever, you get profitable and they almost [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4594.24s)]
*  always get acquired. And in the case of other technology companies, if the business has to do [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4598.88s)]
*  three or four things, it's got three or four milestones it has to hit. In your case, [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4604.8s)]
*  Sachs, it might be that they got to get to 50 million ARR and they got to get the certain [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4608.639999999999s)]
*  cost function down in the business. And if they can do those two things and the business is profitable, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4612.8s)]
*  but it's going to take us around a 20, we'll get the first chunk down and then another round of 30 [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4616.719999999999s)]
*  to get the last chunk done. And no one knows if the next 30 is going to be there. And that's really [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4620.96s)]
*  where a lot of these market dynamics are falling apart, that there's historically been a model in [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4625.52s)]
*  the market of hit milestones, next round shows up, hit milestones, next round shows up. And now [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4630.4800000000005s)]
*  no one knows if the next round will show up. So no one wants to fund this round, particularly [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4635.52s)]
*  where there's high burn and it requires a lot of capital to make that bet. So the social, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4640.72s)]
*  the self-fulfilling problem, the social market bet right now is, it self-fulfills and we're [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4644.88s)]
*  sitting here kind of spinning our thumbs wondering if the next guy is going to fund it. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4651.76s)]
*  Do you think that only 10 or 15% of companies have now properly reset value? Like you said, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4656.88s)]
*  70% of these unicorns are actually zombie corns? [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4664.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I think the number from, I don't know Tiger's book at all, but when I hear numbers [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4667.12s)]
*  like 20% for a fully invested mature book that invested during the peak of the cycle, it doesn't [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4671.76s)]
*  sound right that it's 20%. It sounds like it should be a lot lower. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4678.96s)]
*  I think that 20%, by the way, comes after like two other smaller write down. So they might be [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4684.08s)]
*  cumulative. I don't want to talk about Tiger. I think like the statistic of 70% of these public [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4689.92s)]
*  companies trading below their cash, the cash that they've burnt, that they've raised in their [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4695.84s)]
*  lifetime. And again, just for anyone that's an analyst at home, trying to figure out how we get [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4701.12s)]
*  to that number, you look at the retained earnings on the balance sheet. And so the cumulative [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4706.0s)]
*  retained earnings tells you, if it's negative, tells you how much money they've burnt over their [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4711.68s)]
*  lifetime. And that tells you effectively how much money has been invested. So when you look at the [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4714.72s)]
*  enterprise value, which is the market cap minus the cash they have today, you get their enterprise [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4718.72s)]
*  value. If their enterprise value is less than their cumulative retained earnings, it means that [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4722.8s)]
*  they're currently worth less than the money they've spent. And that's a statistic that is a fact right [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4727.2s)]
*  now in public markets, in technology gone public in the last three years. And then you compare that [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4732.72s)]
*  to private markets. And I don't think we've seen a 70% write down yet. Or, you know, 70% of these [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4737.2s)]
*  things being worth less than the cash. So it's, you know, it's still Yeah, I think you're right, [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4742.4800000000005s)]
*  Jamach. There's probably another hammer to drop multiple hammers, multiple hammers, [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4747.280000000001s)]
*  before we move on to a different topic. So I think one of the interesting differences in opinion and [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4753.4400000000005s)]
*  Silicon Valley is the way that founders and VCC the nature of the relationship, and I've been on [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4758.96s)]
*  both sides of this, I've been on the side of being a founder, and I've been on the side of being a VC. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4764.56s)]
*  And what you'll see is that VCs always talk about it as a partnership. But a lot of founders will [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4769.84s)]
*  talk about it as if the money is just a commodity. And frankly, when everything's up and to the right, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4775.44s)]
*  and everything's going great, and you're in a bull market, and you can just keep raising money, [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4780.08s)]
*  and definitely because there's always someone willing to lead the next round, then the money [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4783.44s)]
*  is a commodity. But when you're in a down market, and all of a sudden, there is no market, like you [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4787.76s)]
*  can't raise your next round, all of a sudden, it is a partnership, because you've got to go to your [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4794.320000000001s)]
*  investors and ask them to do something that they may not otherwise want to do. This was purely [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4798.4800000000005s)]
*  a transactional decision, as opposed to a relationship, they might not want to fund [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4804.56s)]
*  your next round. And you're asking them to say, No, actually, believe in our long term relationship. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4810.0s)]
*  And I think that, you know, this is a type of environment, which you find out it is more of a [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4815.04s)]
*  partnership. And it should have always been it should have always been it should have been but [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4819.5199999999995s)]
*  it wasn't. And look, I don't know what happened with that other company. And all of a sudden, [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4824.08s)]
*  I get a notification out of the blue, well, I want to understand the thinking that went into that. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4828.4s)]
*  Before, you know, I'm just gonna basically do this. This is where trust comes in, right? And like, [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4832.48s)]
*  I think in a zero interest rate environment, you know, there's no need for trust, you just this [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4838.5599999999995s)]
*  cash splashing around, just grab whoever the latest person in town is who wants to drop a couple [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4843.28s)]
*  of bags. You just take one of their bags. The most important thing to me, like what would make it a [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4847.44s)]
*  partnership is for me to know that the founders have done everything in their power to reduce costs [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4851.84s)]
*  and put the company on the right trajectory before going out and basically issuing capital calls to [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4857.12s)]
*  the investors. I want to know they've done that work. All right, listen, Freberg, I know you got [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4862.0s)]
*  to go. Take care, Sultan of Science. I'll just wrap up with the other boys here with one piece [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4864.88s)]
*  of breaking news. Stack Overflow says they will join the parade of data providers like Reddit and [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4870.0s)]
*  Twitter that will require permission and payment to use their data sets. And Stack Overflow has [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4876.24s)]
*  a lot of answers to a lot of developers questions in there. I was just curious to get your thoughts. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4881.6s)]
*  SEC obviously sent to Wells, notice we talked about this before to Brian Armstrong of Coinbase. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4886.96s)]
*  He said he's thinking about or considering relocating out of the US if the regulatory [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4891.92s)]
*  clarity does not improve. Crypto's dead in America. It is dead in America. Crypto's dead in America. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4897.2s)]
*  I mean, now you had Gensler, you had Gensler even blaming the banking crisis on crypto. So they've [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4903.84s)]
*  the the United States authorities have firmly pointed their guns at crypto. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4911.599999999999s)]
*  Is it a scapegoat or was it a fuck around find out moment for crypto in your mind? Or a little bit [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4917.12s)]
*  of both? I don't know. I just think that they were probably the ones that were the most threatening [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4923.36s)]
*  to the establishment. Okay. And they were the ones that in fairness to the regulators did push [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4929.599999999999s)]
*  the boundaries more than any other sector of the startup economy. And yeah, so now they're paying [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4935.679999999999s)]
*  the price for that. The bill has come due for them. Sax, is it a fuck around find out moment? Is it [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4941.679999999999s)]
*  protecting the American dollar somewhere in between? Or incompetence on regulators part? [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4947.759999999999s)]
*  The more I think about it, the more I think it's probably not a coincidence that you're seeing all [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4953.759999999999s)]
*  these concerns about de-dollarization at the same time they're cracking down on crypto. So look, [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4957.759999999999s)]
*  there were a bunch of crypto companies that might have done shady things. But I think we all agree [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4962.719999999999s)]
*  that Coinbase was not one of them. Coinbase was the gold standard in terms of doing everything [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4966.96s)]
*  right. And they've just agreed asked over and over again for a regulatory framework. They're just like, [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4971.28s)]
*  tell us how to operate and we'll do it. So I think Jamatha is right that they're effectively [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4976.16s)]
*  banning crypto in the United States. They're going to drive all these companies overseas, [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4981.04s)]
*  which is terrible for American innovation. I don't know exactly where blockchain and [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4984.96s)]
*  crypto are going to go from here. But I think that we should find that out in America. We don't want [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4989.84s)]
*  that innovation going offshore. You bring up a really good point too. It's just like Coinbase [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=4995.68s)]
*  played by the rules stood in line, tried to do the right things. It seems that every step along the [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5001.92s)]
*  way, right? Everything from board composition to executive composition to how they tried to [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5008.24s)]
*  interact with the regulators, yet they were probably the furthest away from getting a license. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5014.5599999999995s)]
*  The one that came the closest was the one that was the most fraudulent, which is FTS. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5018.5599999999995s)]
*  Fascinating. How is that even possible? [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5023.84s)]
*  Because he had skills in gaming the system. Yeah, he's splashy, cashy, splashy, cashy. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5027.599999999999s)]
*  Well, he he ponied up large amounts of money because it wasn't his money. So it was easy for [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5032.639999999999s)]
*  him to make huge donations, but he knew how to play the game. To quote SPF, he said, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5037.76s)]
*  this is the dumb game we woke Westerners play. We say the right shibble, so everyone likes us. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5043.04s)]
*  That's the game he was playing, which is my whole concern about if we jump the gun on regulating [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5048.0s)]
*  AI too quickly, it'll turn into another, you know, woke game that everyone's going to play. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5053.12s)]
*  So here's how the world works. Regulate yourself, behave yourself, act in the interest of consumers, [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5059.04s)]
*  or get regulated or smashed. And I think we've we've gone over this. We talked about it, in fact, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5066.4800000000005s)]
*  last week, whether the movie industry crypto AI, regulate yourself, behave properly, don't push the [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5071.52s)]
*  boundaries too far, you can bend the rules, but you don't want to break them. I think the regulate [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5078.240000000001s)]
*  yourself that you use the MPAA, I don't think that's the right example. I think if you're going to [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5082.88s)]
*  regulate yourself, look at the tobacco industry. They tried to regulate themselves. But what they [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5086.8s)]
*  did was just lie to maximize profit in an area that was much less benign than movies and content. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5093.04s)]
*  Maybe you could have some lascivious content in a movie or a video game or an album. But that was a [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5100.0s)]
*  lot less harmful than smoking, which not just impacted the smoker, but it turned out the [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5106.32s)]
*  secondhand smoker as well, or the secondhand smoke. So it touched everybody, right? You could be in a [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5111.44s)]
*  restaurant, not smoke and yet have years of your life taken. So I think that the self regulation [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5116.4s)]
*  for areas that impact everybody, independent of whether you participate in the system or not, [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5122.8s)]
*  is where you have to look for good examples, Jason, and I'm not sure there are many good [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5128.400000000001s)]
*  examples of separate allegations, those kinds of systems. I mean, I like your workshopping it here. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5131.76s)]
*  I mean, some restaurants would have a smoking section and a non smoking section before there [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5135.92s)]
*  was regulation, right? And I think if crypto had just thought had been more thoughtful about, hey, [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5140.16s)]
*  which tokens NFT projects we're going to support, which ones we're not going to, [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5145.04s)]
*  that maybe they would have avoided a little bit of this. I'm not sure. You know, it's it's [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5150.08s)]
*  hindsight 2020 here, but a little more regulation. I don't think those smoking non smoking sections [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5154.0s)]
*  work too well. The smoke went all over the place. Remember, you remember coming out of a bar and you [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5159.5199999999995s)]
*  woke up the next day and your clothes smell like smoke. You'd have to take a shower when you went [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5165.12s)]
*  to a bar or a restaurant or a club, you would have to come home take a shower because your hair, [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5169.599999999999s)]
*  the oil, the smell of smoke goes, you couldn't sleep in a bed, then your bed had to get to change [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5175.200000000001s)]
*  your sheets. Disgusting. Remember when you went on a commercial flight, then a smoking section, [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5180.160000000001s)]
*  a non smoking section, it's a tube, the smoke gets all over the place. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5185.200000000001s)]
*  You know, you're on the wrong airline when they have the welded shut ashtray. They used to have [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5191.12s)]
*  an ashtray in every seat in the armrest was a friend of mine. This is like such a throwback, [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5196.96s)]
*  but a friend of mine. Well known guy that you know, I'll say the name you can bleep it out. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5204.32s)]
*  Nick, please bleep that out. Please very important. We don't want to [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5209.759999999999s)]
*  is a notorious smoker. And so I flown with him. That's the worst. And we get in there on his plane [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5213.5199999999995s)]
*  and then we he shuts the door and I'm like, smells a little odd in here smells a little [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5220.48s)]
*  clovey. Seven hours I'm gonna have to be in this. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5224.88s)]
*  What are the pilots? Do the pilots get hazard pay? I mean, how do you compensate them? I mean, [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5230.719999999999s)]
*  this is not a turbo prop he's on. He can't crack the window. No. It was a global, [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5237.12s)]
*  a huge global it was it was three cabins, you could go to the cabin felt so sick. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5242.959999999999s)]
*  It's the worst. It's the absolute worst. Smoking is the worst. All right. Well, we didn't so long [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5249.36s)]
*  to the Sultan of silence as a science rather there. Polling update here, sex, I don't mean [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5255.6s)]
*  to poke the bear. I know it's a rough week with the Fox News news. Bring it up. Bring it up. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5261.6s)]
*  No, go for it. Quick polling update between putting Ron I'm sorry, DeSantis and try [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5268.160000000001s)]
*  not gonna happen. DeSantis is not happening. In late March news of Trump's indictment [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5274.08s)]
*  boosted him over DeSantis by 26 percentage points among Republicans and republic leaning [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5279.92s)]
*  independence. But earlier this week, the same poll showed that Trump's lead shrunk by 10 points in [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5286.0s)]
*  the last two weeks to just a 16 point advantage, which is still significant. But there's more [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5291.2s)]
*  University of New Hampshire survey center poll. I don't know if any of these polls are reasonable [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5297.76s)]
*  or not. That seems like call people on the phone. I don't know who's got a landline. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5301.5199999999995s)]
*  Release Wednesday showed a 20 point to Santa's deficit. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5305.4400000000005s)]
*  What's going on here, sex? Did your boy peak too early? [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5310.8s)]
*  No, I don't think so. If you if you look at the Republican primary field, [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5315.2s)]
*  DeSantis is the only person who's got a shot other than Trump. You look at Nikki Haley, [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5319.360000000001s)]
*  she's pulling in the three, four, 5% range. All the others are at one or 2%. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5324.96s)]
*  There's not a candidate other than DeSantis that has over 5%. So in my view, this is a Trump to [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5329.360000000001s)]
*  Santa's race. Now what you saw is that when Alvin Bragg pressed charges and indicted Trump, [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5335.92s)]
*  it created a lot of sympathy for Trump among Republicans. Effectively, what happened is [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5342.400000000001s)]
*  Republicans registered their displeasure with Alvin Bragg by indicating support for Trump. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5347.6s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5353.280000000001s)]
*  And that's that's what you'd expect to happen. And a lot of people [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5353.84s)]
*  speculated that might be the purpose of Bragg's prosecution is to make Trump the candidate. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5356.56s)]
*  So we knew that was happening. But I think this this new poll that you just mentioned is really [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5362.400000000001s)]
*  interesting because it shows that that sugar high of Trump's poll ratings was a temporary bounce and [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5366.8s)]
*  it's coming down somewhat. And so you know, what you saw actually is that this huge poll bounce [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5374.64s)]
*  that Trump got is somewhat normalizing. Now, there's no question that DeSantis is running [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5381.04s)]
*  behind Trump and he's got his work cut out for him if he's going to upset Trump as the nominee. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5387.6s)]
*  But this thing is just getting started. I mean, DeSantis isn't even formally announced yet. And [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5392.32s)]
*  remember, we're still very, very early in this race. The primary battle that this most reminds [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5397.2s)]
*  me of would be Obama versus Hillary in 2007. And at this time in 2007, [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5401.68s)]
*  Hillary had a huge advantage over Obama. She was considered the favorite, she was considered the [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5410.56s)]
*  the one who couldn't lose. And it was Obama that pulled off a huge upset. And he did it by [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5416.56s)]
*  fundraising her out hustling her, especially in building organization and some of those early [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5422.16s)]
*  primary states. And then he eventually created a narrative that it was time to turn the page. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5427.12s)]
*  But he didn't do that until much later in the year, much closer to the primary. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5433.44s)]
*  The first Republican primary here is not till February. So there's plenty of time here. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5438.08s)]
*  And I, you know, we'll see what happens. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5441.84s)]
*  So Anthony, that's... [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5443.76s)]
*  I think Nikki Haley is going to win the Republican nomination. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5445.84s)]
*  All right. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5448.16s)]
*  The more people, here's the thing, the number of people that have told me [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5448.4s)]
*  the most impressive moment with DeSantis was before they met him. The second most impressive [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5455.68s)]
*  moment was their first meeting. And then it just falls off a cliff where he becomes more and more [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5461.68s)]
*  unimpressive the more and more time you spend with this guy. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5467.2s)]
*  Okay. Hey, Nikki Haley, come on the pod. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5469.76s)]
*  Nikki Haley is the opposite. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5471.68s)]
*  Nikki Haley announced that in all of Q1, in all of Q1, she raised $5 million, extremely unimpressive. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5473.84s)]
*  You're probably 20% of that, Chamath. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5479.6s)]
*  Hey, Nikki Haley, come on the pod. We'll double it. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5481.92s)]
*  How much of Nikki Haley's $5 million was you? [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5484.320000000001s)]
*  Listen. Zero. I can say definitively you said Q1? [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5488.320000000001s)]
*  Zero. Yeah, Q1. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5492.72s)]
*  Here we go. Zero. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5494.16s)]
*  But let me ask a question here because I'm not informed on it, but you're a master strategist [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5495.68s)]
*  here. 1600 rated chess player, Sax. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5501.92s)]
*  That's not that good. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5506.96s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's double 800 where I'm at. You're killing me in 27 moves on average. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5508.400000000001s)]
*  The Santas is fighting with Disney over and over again. He's getting a little involved in the LGBTQ, [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5513.92s)]
*  everything and he just seems to be getting involved in the culture wars. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5520.4800000000005s)]
*  Is that like a primary strategy and then he moves to the center when he comes to the general or and [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5524.400000000001s)]
*  do you agree with this general fighting with Disney and the culture war stuff? [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5531.12s)]
*  Well, strategically, not your personal opinion on these issues. I know that you're a very [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5537.280000000001s)]
*  tolerant person. Yeah. So I think this is an issue that works for him, certainly in the Republican [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5541.28s)]
*  primary, but I also think it's going to work for him in the general. And you have to remember that [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5545.92s)]
*  this bill that they're fighting over was a parental rights bill that basically it gave [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5550.08s)]
*  parents the right to know what their kids were being taught in schools and it basically prohibited [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5555.599999999999s)]
*  the teaching of this sort of gender ideology in schools. And I think most parents are on board [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5561.04s)]
*  with that. Now, yeah, he didn't go look at a pick a fight with Disney. Disney then got involved [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5567.76s)]
*  and took the side that calling this a don't say gay bill, which I think is factually is not true. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5574.64s)]
*  The bill doesn't mention, you know, gay or homosexuality or anything like that. It was [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5579.76s)]
*  really about this trans issue and Disney got involved and this was Bob Chapek and Bob Chapek [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5585.12s)]
*  lost his job and Eiger came in and Eiger has said that he had basically lectured the Disney employees [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5591.84s)]
*  saying that we need to stay out of politics and we need to respect our audience's views. So I think [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5598.32s)]
*  that it was Disney who kind of interfered. I think this is overall played to D'Santis' benefit. And [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5602.88s)]
*  look, the problem for Disney, they may win the battle over this or that tax benefit that they're [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5608.4800000000005s)]
*  fighting over, but they've lost the war over this issue because parents used to be able to trust [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5612.96s)]
*  that they could just plop their kid down in front of a Disney movie or a Disney show like Disney was [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5620.8s)]
*  like the babysitter and they just 100% absolutely trusted all Disney content. And if you look at [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5625.6s)]
*  polling now, Disney's brand, it used to have like a NPS of like in the 50s is now in the single digits [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5632.320000000001s)]
*  because let's call it half the country's parents, the more Republican ones don't fully trust [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5638.400000000001s)]
*  Disney's content and programming anymore. Really? That is a huge, yeah, that is- [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5643.84s)]
*  implicitly. What could they ever do that's objection-wide? I've never seen anything [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5648.16s)]
*  objectionable. A lot of parents are questioning what content Disney might be putting in their [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5652.639999999999s)]
*  recent programming. Obviously, we're not talking about the stuff that we grew up on. So look, [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5658.639999999999s)]
*  whether you believe that is a problem or not, what I'm saying is this has been a brand disaster [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5663.2s)]
*  for Disney getting involved with D'Santis this way. They should really, I think, just try to [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5668.799999999999s)]
*  patch this thing up. I don't understand the benefit for Disney. It's a bad look for both. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5673.36s)]
*  It's a bad look for both people. Yeah. Well, I think I understand the benefit for D'Santis. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5677.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't understand the benefit for Disney. If I were them, I'd be trying to patch this up. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5682.08s)]
*  I think there is a really valid discussion to be had about representation in movies and all that [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5686.5599999999995s)]
*  stuff. And I'm very pro that the thing I think all parents agree is we should just at least know [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5692.0s)]
*  what's being taught to our kids. And we can have a thoughtful discussion about it. There seems to be [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5698.639999999999s)]
*  some small group of people that thinks we should hide from parents what they're actually getting. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5702.4s)]
*  What's being taught and I find that's very strange. I think just a little bit of like [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5709.5199999999995s)]
*  transparency and what's being taught in schools is an obvious thing that nobody should be [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5713.92s)]
*  disagreeing on it. To Saks's point, I think it was Pew that put out a study recently. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5719.5199999999995s)]
*  It is the most polarizing issue amongst Americans where Democrats and Republicans are literally on [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5724.96s)]
*  opposite sides of the spectrum. That's going to be a big issue. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5730.56s)]
*  On the whole trans issue. Now, despite the polarization, in terms of the quantity of the [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5733.280000000001s)]
*  number of people, it's actually an important issue for a small percentage of both sides. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5738.56s)]
*  So it's a highly complicated political dynamic in America. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5743.68s)]
*  Yeah. Very. So this is where D'Santis clearly has [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5747.120000000001s)]
*  taken the approach that not only is this important to the base to win the nomination, but it's going [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5751.52s)]
*  to scale into the general and it could very well be, but it's a very divisive issue. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5755.84s)]
*  I wish people were given a little bit more consideration and maybe they could have, [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5760.4s)]
*  I feel like maybe we're covering this issue too much. I've heard some other folks in the [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5769.52s)]
*  community say like maybe people could be given a little bit of their privacy and to handle these [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5773.76s)]
*  things. I think you're right, Jay Kal in this sense. I think this issue has become a lightning [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5777.84s)]
*  rod and whenever you have a lightning rod issue, the amount of attention paid to it, it seems [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5781.44s)]
*  disproportionate to the attention on that issue. However, I would say that this is a lightning [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5786.88s)]
*  rod for a larger issue, which is the quality of education in this country, which I think is [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5793.36s)]
*  shockingly bad and it's bad because of the decline of standards. They're getting rid of advanced math, [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5799.28s)]
*  they're getting rid of grades, testing. Exactly. And the schools are run by these unions who are [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5806.56s)]
*  managing it for their own benefit, not for the benefit of the students. And look, there is a [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5813.12s)]
*  significant ideological component that's crept into these schools as well. So look, I think that [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5816.64s)]
*  overall, I think that when you get into the general, you have to up-level the issue and talk [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5821.52s)]
*  about it in broader terms that every kid in our country deserves a high quality non-ideological [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5827.04s)]
*  education. I think if you can do that, you will get 70, 80% of the public on your side on this issue. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5832.96s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like, yeah. I think that's right. I think we can all agree on that, Democrats, [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5839.12s)]
*  Republicans, everybody in between. If you're a parent, you're not looking for an ideological [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5844.16s)]
*  battle at school. You're looking for math, science, technology, history, creativity. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5848.4s)]
*  There's a whole bunch of other things that we should be really focused on. All right, listen, [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5854.0s)]
*  this has been another amazing episode of the All In Podcast. To people going to the episode 125 [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5857.599999999999s)]

*  We'll see you next time. Bye bye. Bye bye. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvTTDxMuAis&t=5889.76s)]
