# E110 2023 Bestie Predictions!
**All In Podcast:** [January 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY)
*  All right, everybody. Welcome to 2023. Everybody's well rested and ready to take on 2023. Yes, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=0.0s)]
*  Jamal. How was your break? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=6.04s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Okay, sexy poo. I know you don't go to temperatures that are under 57 degrees anymore. Do you [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=8.6s)]
*  have a nice break? Did you go somewhere warm? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=14.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=16.44s)]
*  Okay, that's a confirmation. Wow, man, have so many words. And Freeburg. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=17.44s)]
*  I'm over cold weather vacations. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=21.68s)]
*  Yeah, that does happen at a certain point. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=23.48s)]
*  Actually, we went to Florida. We went to the free state of Florida. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=25.88s)]
*  Oh, really? What's going on in Florida at the turn of the new year, I wonder, that drew [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  you down to the great state of Florida? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=34.36s)]
*  We're just freeing it up in the free state of Florida. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  We have our 2023 predictions now. Play some music and all that kind of stuff. Producer [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=40.88s)]
*  Nick at this point, let's get to it. Last year, we did our biggest... [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=62.08s)]
*  Do you guys notice that every time we talk about something, somewhere between sort of [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=66.44s)]
*  two months to a year later, the Wall Street Journal ends up writing a big piece about [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=71.24s)]
*  it? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=75.8s)]
*  Think piece about it. Yes. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=76.8s)]
*  So I tweeted into the group chat, like last year, we all talked about Sequoia and distributing [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=77.8s)]
*  public equities and how it's very fraught and difficult. And then today they write this [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=82.08s)]
*  big article about how people have just burned enormous amounts of billions of dollars that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=87.4s)]
*  they could have returned to LPs, like these venture investors, by not distributing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=93.04s)]
*  It makes sense. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=98.96s)]
*  Three weeks ago, when we did our end of the year wrap up, my big winner for 2022 were [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=99.96s)]
*  the pot shops, right? Citadel. And today in Wall Street Journal, an article lands that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=105.64s)]
*  these guys with 56 billion of AUM over the last two years have made almost 45 billion [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  dollars of revenues. Isn't that incredible? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  This is what happens, Chamath. Usually... [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=121.84s)]
*  These guys are just crushing it. Citadel securities did like almost seven and a half [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=124.48s)]
*  billion of revenue. I mean, it's unbelievable these businesses, how good they are. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=130.12s)]
*  Yes. So let's get into... And this is typical. Chamath, if you think about journalists, they're [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  trying to get into the conversations that are occurring at the bar after the event, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=139.8s)]
*  the late night conversation, the group chats. Well, and that's what this podcast is. It's [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=144.0s)]
*  the exposed back channel, right? And so if you listen to this pod, you got the back channel [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  of Silicon Valley, politics, tech, science, etc. So let's do our predictions. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=152.28s)]
*  In 2020, we said our biggest political winner would be... Sax and I both said DeSantis, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=157.56s)]
*  Chamath said Xi Jinping, and Freiburg said Putin. Who do we think is our biggest political [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  winner going forward? Who do you pick, Sax, biggest political winner for 2023? Who will [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=166.56s)]
*  be your biggest political winner for 2023? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=172.04s)]
*  Well, I went a little bit outside the box here because I think we're going to have gridlock [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  in Washington, so I'm not expecting a ton to be coming out of Washington over the next [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=177.08s)]
*  year. My pick for biggest political winner is Asian American college applicants. There [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=181.32000000000002s)]
*  are two Supreme Court decisions that the court heard on Halloween last year. There was a [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=188.8s)]
*  lawsuit against Harvard and another lawsuit against UNC by a group called Students for [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  Fair Admissions, and they maintained that Harvard and UNC violate Title VI of the Civil [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=202.68s)]
*  Rights Act because Asian American applicants are far less likely to be admitted than similarly [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=208.08s)]
*  qualified applicants from other groups. And the federal courts in Boston and North Carolina [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=213.96s)]
*  rejected this argument, but the Supreme Court took up the cases, so they kind of went out [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=220.16s)]
*  of their way to hear this. And I think that they are going to... [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=225.44s)]
*  They're going to repeal affirmative action. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=229.8s)]
*  I think the majority will rule to strike down these policies that really discriminate against [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  Asian Americans. And I think they're the last group in America where it seems to be okay [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=237.68s)]
*  to discriminate against. And I think the Supreme Court is going to find that unconstitutional. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  Tramath, any thoughts there? You have brought this up multiple times on the podcast over [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  the last two years. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  I have said that this was unfortunately... Affirmative action, when it started, I think [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=254.52s)]
*  had very, very good intentions. And I still think that there's a place for it. The problem [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=260.92s)]
*  is that these very liberal institutions decided to play judge, jury, and executioner on which [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=266.04s)]
*  minorities counted in affirmative action. And that's not what the intention was. The [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=273.2s)]
*  intention was to look at the establishment and their ability to get their progeny into [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=280.12s)]
*  these incredible schools, even when they didn't deserve to be there. And so I think this was [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=285.47999999999996s)]
*  always an issue of classism that was disguised as racism. And people who were in the upper [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=292.03999999999996s)]
*  classes of society have always had an edge. You had the legacy admissions into Harvard. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=300.44s)]
*  You had people, the Kushners, very famously, right, like the $5 million check from the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=306.04s)]
*  father that got the son into the school, all of this stuff. It's been well written about. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=310.76000000000005s)]
*  And whether or not those things are right isn't the point. I think the point is that [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=315.88s)]
*  there are folks in emerging lower middle classes who have the potential to crush. And those [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=319.20000000000005s)]
*  kids should have a chance. And you can't just decide who those kids are based on the color [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=326.0s)]
*  of their skin. And in this case, what happened was some blacks were still allowed in some [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=331.6s)]
*  Hispanics were allowed in but Asian Americans broadly were discriminated. And that was a [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  really stupid outcome. You cannot punish kids for willing to work their ass off. And I think [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=340.72s)]
*  that that was the unfortunate outcome of what affirmative action has become by 2022. So it is [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=349.68s)]
*  going to get repealed. The reason it's going to get repealed is that, you know, we have case law [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=355.84s)]
*  that very clearly states that any institution that accepts federal funds cannot have any form of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  discrimination. And this is how these folks who have tried to repeal affirmative action have [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=368.47999999999996s)]
*  taken up this lawsuit. And hopefully, the outcome is a more meritocratic system that also [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=374.79999999999995s)]
*  tries to create a plurality of different people from different backgrounds. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=381.68s)]
*  Freeberg, any thoughts? And if not, your biggest political winner for 2023. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=385.68s)]
*  My biggest political winner for 2023 is MBS Mohammed bin Salman. I think that Saudi Arabia [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  will have the most important year in kind of the modern era in terms of their role. I don't know [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  if you guys saw this Reuters report from a few weeks ago, but there's kind of a deepening [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=407.28s)]
*  discussion about the oil Yuan trade in that Saudi would sell oil to China and they would get paid [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=413.44s)]
*  in Yuan. Saudi Arabia sits at the intersection of the United States, Russia and China. They have [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=422.88s)]
*  relationships with all three nations. And in the kind of conflict and power struggle that is [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=427.91999999999996s)]
*  underway, I think that ultimately the direction of where global currency kind of reserves will [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=434.16s)]
*  be taken and the importance of these great nations and who sits atop whom can actually be dictated [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=441.52000000000004s)]
*  and significantly influenced by MBS this year by some of the deals and trades he might put in place [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=449.04s)]
*  and the kind of partnerships he might forge. I think as a result, you will see him kind of rise [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=454.8s)]
*  in terms of influence, not in terms of, you know, hey, the world has accolades for this guy. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=462.96s)]
*  But I think in terms of global influence, he will rocket ship to kind of the top because of this [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=467.84s)]
*  jockeying he can now do between these three great nation states and defining what's going to happen [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=474.56s)]
*  with the US and what's going to happen with China and what's going to happen with currency reserves. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=480.47999999999996s)]
*  Great selection. The shitty thing, by the way, about your selection is that Biden, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=484.0s)]
*  our explicit stance is unfortunately [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=489.44s)]
*  quite confrontational with MBS. And you saw that play out in Q4. We asked them to ease up on OPEC [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=494.96s)]
*  plus to introduce [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=503.44s)]
*  supply cuts and they did some nominal 100,000 barrel per day cut. Didn't do much of anything. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=508.56s)]
*  There was an article to your point, Freebird, just recently about Saudi really doubling down [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=516.24s)]
*  on getting the oil out of the ground and monetizing their petrochemicals. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=523.76s)]
*  So there's just going to be a glut of supply in the market. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=527.84s)]
*  And we have the least amount of influence with Saudi Arabia than we've ever had. And it seems [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=531.92s)]
*  like we could change that if we decided to. But I think Biden has taken this very confrontational [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=538.88s)]
*  approach, which doesn't seem to make a lot of sense. Their stated intent is to diversify away [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=543.44s)]
*  from oil and into technology and other kind of emerging growth economies. That's why they funded [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=549.0400000000001s)]
*  the Vision Fund. That's why MBS made that big kind of visit to Silicon Valley a few years ago. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=554.08s)]
*  And there is technology that they want to import into Saudi Arabia and they want to have ownership [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=559.36s)]
*  in around the world. And if the US is creating a barrier for them to import US tech into Saudi or [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=563.7600000000001s)]
*  for Saudi to kind of invest in the US, but China and Russia have open arms and all they want [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=568.72s)]
*  is for Saudi to start doing trades in Yuan, it's going to happen. And I think that's where this [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=573.84s)]
*  guy has kind of a real opportunity to shift the global economic dynamic. Say what you will about [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=578.48s)]
*  Trump. He had open dialogue with North Korea, China, Russia, MBS. Keep your enemies close. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=583.76s)]
*  Sure. You want to be able to talk to anybody. And he was able to talk to anybody. Now you also want [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=592.08s)]
*  to be able to say, Hey, listen, you can't dismember a journalist like Khashoggi and you need to be [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=597.28s)]
*  able to have both of those ideas in your head. You can't be rigid in foreign policy. You have [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=601.28s)]
*  to be fluid and keep people at the table talking. Chamath, who is your big political, who do you [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=604.8s)]
*  predict will be the big political winner of 2023? Chamath's prediction, everybody. Go ahead. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=610.24s)]
*  I really like spread trades, right? Where you go long something and short another. So I'd like to [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=614.48s)]
*  pair my biggest political winner with my biggest political loser for 2023. Okay. And I am going to [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=619.76s)]
*  focus on the Republican nomination and I am going to go long Nikki Haley and I'm going to go short [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=625.68s)]
*  Ron DeSantis. Now let me [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=633.5999999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=635.1999999999999s)]
*  Sax, if you're watching, if you're not watching Sax right now, he is ready to interject. Go Chamath. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=637.28s)]
*  So I think that all of this nonsense, for example, in the house speaker race, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=644.0s)]
*  all of the midterm results, what it really speaks to are as people are getting exhausted with the [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=649.76s)]
*  lunatic fringes of both parties. That's point number one. And point so that favors moderates [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=656.4000000000001s)]
*  as an emergent class. And point number two is that if you look back through many, many cycles [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=664.1600000000001s)]
*  of Republican and Democratic nominations, it is a very negative thing to be in the lead so early [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=669.6800000000001s)]
*  going into the Iowa caucuses in January. And so if you put those two things together, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=676.96s)]
*  the risk is that DeSantis decays, things emerge, people attack him because he's the clear front [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=682.8000000000001s)]
*  runner. And the opportunity just like it was for Trump in 16 or for Clinton, or for George Bush, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=689.2800000000001s)]
*  not Herbert Walker, but you know, W is to emerge from the back. And so if I think about a moderate [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=697.9200000000001s)]
*  person who can emerge from the back, who can consolidate the ranks, they should probably be [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=704.32s)]
*  from the south, they will have a lot of these purple compromises that sacks mentioned in their [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=709.6s)]
*  policy program. And they will have a history of winning and a history of normalcy. And so I think [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=715.6s)]
*  that of all of the places where you could ever elect a woman as President of the United States, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=725.2800000000001s)]
*  I think it will come from the Republicans before it comes from the Democrats. I mean, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=729.84s)]
*  the Democrats are unfortunately increasingly judgmental. And I think it's very difficult [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=734.1600000000001s)]
*  for a woman to emerge there. But I do think that Nikki Haley has a shot. So I'm going to go long [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=739.9200000000001s)]
*  Nikki Haley, and I'm going to short Ron DeSantis. Okay, I like it a spread trade for his prediction. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=744.48s)]
*  Well done before sacks you interject, let me just do mine and because then you'll have to interject [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=750.32s)]
*  to I was looking at Biden and Trump and thinking, hmm, which one of these is going to have the big [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=754.64s)]
*  win in 2020? So the two biggest, I think players, I have a prediction for Trump, I think he's going [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=761.6s)]
*  to lose 50 pounds on the ozempic. Everybody loves a weight loss story. I think he is going to be [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=767.68s)]
*  indicted by Garland. Is he on? Wait a minute. Sorry. He's on ozempic? No, I'm predicting an [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=773.84s)]
*  ozempic run. And he's going to drop 4050 pounds. Then we're going to have a Schveldt Trump get [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=779.44s)]
*  indicted by Garland. And the debates and the and the and the rigmarole with DeSantis, I think he's [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=785.6800000000001s)]
*  gonna go after DeSantis based on weight and height. And then he's going to win the nomination in 24. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=792.6400000000001s)]
*  And we're going to have Trump versus Biden. But this is a crazy prediction here. I think we're [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=799.7600000000001s)]
*  going to have a settlement. I think he's going to agree to not run and get the pardon. This is a [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=805.12s)]
*  crazy prediction. I know. But I think he loses the weight. He wins the nom. He gets indicted. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=811.84s)]
*  And then he gets the Richard Nixon pardon global pardon for all of the shit he's done. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=818.72s)]
*  Sax, you can reply to these two crazy predictions. Is that right? I mean, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=825.52s)]
*  this is like proof positive that everything you have to say about Trump is an act of projection. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=830.48s)]
*  I mean, like a zempic. I mean, are you talking about yourself or Trump? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=835.76s)]
*  Strike. Boom. Tell us your ozempic story, Jacob. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=842.9599999999999s)]
*  Both of my weight loss journey has been ozempic and super good. Yes. Both of those things and [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=846.16s)]
*  fasting. Have you, Sax, done any ozempic? Yeah, I've tried it. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=849.84s)]
*  Yeah. I think everybody should be looking into this if you have weight issues. It's a great new [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=853.6s)]
*  I would say it even more broadly. I've been reading a lot about these GLP ones. And I [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=859.12s)]
*  got to tell you statins are a clear wonder drug. Yes. Okay. I think that the 50 year longitudinal [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=862.72s)]
*  data on its value is pretty unimpeachable. Metformin even taken prophylactically has shown [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=868.64s)]
*  incredible benefits for cell regeneration, longevity, and glucose management. And the [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=877.68s)]
*  reality is, let's just take a step back. The American diet, we're all pre-diabetic. Okay, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=884.32s)]
*  so let's just let's just not beat around the bush. The way that Americans eat and our food [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=888.48s)]
*  supply and also probably in Western Europe is pre-diabetic by definition. It's shit. It's trash. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=893.04s)]
*  So metformin makes a lot of sense. And again, its longitudinal data is incredible. But I got to tell [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=900.64s)]
*  you, the early data on these GLP ones are unbelievable. It's extraordinary. And I can [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=904.8s)]
*  tell you from first hand experience, I would lose half a pound a week when I would diet. No, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=911.68s)]
*  but what I'm saying is just it's beyond that. And what I'm talking about is insulin response. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=916.2399999999999s)]
*  It's cardiac health. And so if this data tracks like this, man, you just want to put everybody [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=921.12s)]
*  on these GLP. Well, I just want to also put a disclaimer here. Do your own research, work [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=926.0799999999999s)]
*  with your doctors, whether it's for metformin or azempic, but I had great results on it. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=929.12s)]
*  I recommend if you're struggling with weight loss, like I did for many years, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=933.52s)]
*  you talk to your doctor about it. That's it. It's not a commercial for Wigovia or azempic, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=936.9599999999999s)]
*  but I do think these things are going to change the world. Well, and they're getting better. And [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=940.32s)]
*  it seems like people with diabetes are on them for life. So if your question is like, if I could [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=944.0s)]
*  do this for a year to lose weight, you know, I think diabetics are on it for life. So when I made [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=948.88s)]
*  my decision again, work with your doctors, not random podcast or venture capitalists for your [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=952.6400000000001s)]
*  health advice. I was like, well, if all of these people have diabetes are going to on it for years, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=957.5200000000001s)]
*  unless it's non toxic, go get a prenuvo scan, just make sure absolutely you got the right. So there [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=962.8000000000001s)]
*  you have it. Those are our predictions. Did you want to respond to any of those? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=967.6s)]
*  I want the sacks to react to my spread trading. Yeah. So look, I think, you know, if you're going [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=971.52s)]
*  on a betting site, I think that you could place that bet that Chamath made pretty cheaply and [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=976.4s)]
*  probably it's like has some good upside to it. So I don't criticize it as a bet. Do I think it's [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=981.76s)]
*  actually going to happen? No. And I think the reason is this, that if you look at what's happening [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=986.0s)]
*  right now with the speaker's race, there's two very clear wings in the Republican Party. There's [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=991.6s)]
*  the establishment wing and then there's kind of this populist MAGA wing. And the candidate, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=996.16s)]
*  whoever it is in 24 needs to unite those two wings. And I think this is really the best argument for [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1001.52s)]
*  DeSantis is he's widely accepted by both. I think Nikki Haley's problem is that she's very well [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1007.28s)]
*  regarded within the establishment wing of the Republican Party, but she has no meaningful [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1012.0799999999999s)]
*  support within the populist wing. And so I don't think she's capable of bringing the party together, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1016.64s)]
*  at least at this point in time, she would have to prove let's call it populist bonafide that [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1022.24s)]
*  she just doesn't have right now. So this is why I think, you know, DeSantis, he does have front [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1027.36s)]
*  runner risks. You're right that people are going to keep taking shots of them as long as he's the [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1032.96s)]
*  front runner. But all right, let's, he's capable of uniting the party in a way that it desperately [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1036.88s)]
*  needs right now, as we're seeing with the Kevin McCarthy thing playing out. Yeah. Okay. Let's go [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1042.56s)]
*  for our biggest losers. We'll rip through this last year, I said Biden and Trump in the extremes. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1046.72s)]
*  Chamath said the progressive left again, the extreme. Sachs said Pelosi, who just wrapped up [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1053.2s)]
*  her tenure and Freiburg said US influence globally was the biggest political loser. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1057.76s)]
*  Let's get our predictions for the biggest political loser of 2023. Freiburg, who do you [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1064.56s)]
*  think will be the biggest political loser of 2023? The world wants to know, Freiburg. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1070.56s)]
*  I would continue my US influence, but I am going to shift. Here's what I think is going to happen [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1074.96s)]
*  this year. My big prediction is based on, I think the world has too much debt. I think that the [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1080.56s)]
*  economic slowdown coupled with rising interest rates globally and a dearth of kind of asset [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1088.72s)]
*  capital inflows means that there's going to be a lot of issues with a number of debt markets [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1094.64s)]
*  around the world, particularly kind of emerging sovereign debt. Just to give you guys a sense, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1099.1200000000001s)]
*  global debt is about $235 trillion in public and private. That's somewhere between $5 and [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1103.44s)]
*  $15 trillion of interest payments a year, depending on what the net rate is on $96 trillion global GDP. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1109.68s)]
*  There's another trillion and a half of unfunded liabilities in the US and pensions and social [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1116.56s)]
*  security and all this other stuff. I think this is the year where a lot of the debt markets start [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1120.4s)]
*  to unravel. The primary entity that steps in- Is this a business loser or a political loser? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1124.16s)]
*  I'm going to tell it in one second. This is the political ramifications. The political ramifications [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1129.52s)]
*  for me, I think that the entity that steps in to try and support these unwinding moments is the IMF. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1134.24s)]
*  I think that no matter what the IMF does, they're going to look bad. I think that it's sort of like [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1141.68s)]
*  Jerome Powell this past year. You raised rates too late, you raised rates too quickly. No matter [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1146.56s)]
*  what you do, it has some adverse effect and impact. It's either inflationary or it impacts growth. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1152.16s)]
*  I think the IMF is going to get a lot of heat for either acting not too fast enough or acting too [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1157.36s)]
*  aggressively and causing inflation as a bunch of these markets face credit risk this year. My big [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1167.4399999999998s)]
*  bet is the IMF is going to play a major role and we're going to be talking a lot about the IMF later [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1173.04s)]
*  this year. I think as a result, the IMF will get a lot of heat and you'll end up seeing a lot of [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1176.9599999999998s)]
*  pressure and political- Just like we blame NATO, just like we blame Jerome Powell and the Fed, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1182.4799999999998s)]
*  we'll end up blaming the IMF for a bunch of problems that'll arise. But the natural physics [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1186.88s)]
*  of what's going on is the world has too much debt and not enough growth to cover the cost of debt. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1192.0800000000002s)]
*  That's it. The IMF will be the political hit that'll result. It'll complicate it [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1196.64s)]
*  of a point of view, but I think- Yeah. Who do you have as your biggest political loser [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1202.16s)]
*  prediction for 2023, Mr. David Sacks? Well, I mean, Kevin McCarthy may not [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1208.3200000000002s)]
*  survive the week, so let me go in a different direction. I think California is my big political [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1213.28s)]
*  loser and I would say in particular, the city of San Francisco, both are going to have gigantic [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1220.0s)]
*  budget shortfalls. You may remember that this is back in 2021 when we had that asset bubble. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1225.04s)]
*  California had a surplus of 76 billion- Insane. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1231.76s)]
*  Insane. And then 2022 happened and now the state is looking at a $24 billion deficit. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1236.64s)]
*  Well, if we had taken, say, a third of that surplus from 21 and put it in a rainy day fund, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1243.6000000000001s)]
*  we wouldn't have to worry about this deficit, but that was never done. Newsom started handing that [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1249.44s)]
*  money out like candy to the electorate, to Goose's re-elect numbers and to get him past that recall, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1254.48s)]
*  remember. So the state never got a fiscal outlook in order and now I think it's going to be even [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1262.4s)]
*  worse in 2023. San Francisco, the city, very similar kind of problem where its tax base is [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1267.92s)]
*  heavily dependent on commercial real estate, which is really suffering. So the city of San [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1276.16s)]
*  Francisco and the state of California, they've moved their tax base to highly volatile capital [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1280.3200000000002s)]
*  gains and with a really lousy stock market, I don't know how these guys are going to meet their [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1286.4s)]
*  budgets. So a lot of pain coming. There's going to be a lot of austerity and pain coming, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1291.04s)]
*  that's for sure. And these people do not know how to manage a budget. They're incompetent. So you [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1294.24s)]
*  say California, Freiburg says IMF, Chamath, who do you think the biggest political loser for 2023 [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1300.08s)]
*  will be? Already gave you your prediction. DeSantis, right? Remember, as part of this picture. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1305.12s)]
*  I'm in alignment with you. I think DeSantis peaked a little too early and the forever Trumpers in [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1308.1599999999999s)]
*  the chaos is going to be a little too much for him to handle. Okay, now we get into what everybody [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1313.04s)]
*  wants business, business, business, biggest business winner for 2023. Who do you have Chamath [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1319.12s)]
*  for your biggest business winner of 2023? I'm going to pick something out of my portfolio. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1325.12s)]
*  I think I'm the only non trivially large investor in both SpaceX and relativity space. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1330.7199999999998s)]
*  Relativity space has a huge SpaceX is clearly just crushing on all cylinders. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1339.76s)]
*  And they're really the only game in town with respect to launch capability. And if you just [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1344.48s)]
*  Google it, you'll see that the Europeans, you know, have a hit or miss capability on launch. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1349.6s)]
*  The Russians are completely unable to do launch now because of all of these sanctions. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1356.4s)]
*  The private companies in New Zealand or the United States have also had fits and starts [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1362.08s)]
*  really incapable. Relativity, which is really, which is now the second biggest company in the [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1366.48s)]
*  most highly valued space business is about to do a launch in the third week of January. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1374.4s)]
*  And the big difference between it and SpaceX, which is sort of why we did it, this is a [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1383.68s)]
*  early YC company, I did the series A and kind of went along the whole way. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1388.8s)]
*  They have 3d printed everything. And the reason why 3d printing is interesting is you take a so [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1392.56s)]
*  if you if you think a rocket costs $5 billion, it built by NASA, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1399.44s)]
*  Elon was able to take that to 100 to 500 million. And if you 3d print everything, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1404.56s)]
*  you can take that cost to like five to 50 million. And so it allows you to just have [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1410.4s)]
*  this repeatability and manufacturability. Now SpaceX also has a lot of 3d printed parts, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1414.64s)]
*  but relativity is entirely 3d printed. It has a launch in three weeks [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1419.04s)]
*  at Cape Canaveral, I think. And we have a like a $10 billion order book that gets unlocked. So I [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1425.36s)]
*  don't know how to see beyond a lot of these market forecasts right now. So I'd rather pick a company [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1434.1599999999999s)]
*  I'll pick something in my portfolio. If the rocket does not blow up, there's a $10 billion order book. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1439.28s)]
*  And this company is now on a trajectory to be as valued as basic. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1445.28s)]
*  All right, it's [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1450.1599999999999s)]
*  his book times two. And if it doesn't, it goes to zero. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1451.3600000000001s)]
*  Freeberg, go ahead and talk your book times two or three. Let's see if you can one up your mouth. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1455.0400000000002s)]
*  Which one of your investments will be the biggest business winner of 2023? Freeberg? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1460.48s)]
*  I'm not an investor. My big bet is open AI. It's just way too obvious to be anything else this year. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1465.1200000000001s)]
*  As you guys know, there are dozens of startups that are being started right now based on an [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1469.92s)]
*  open AI demonstration of Dolly and chat GPT. I think we're seeing this in the enterprise and [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1474.16s)]
*  consumer markets. I think open AI will become to some degree maybe they could be as many paths [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1479.28s)]
*  they could take the AWS providing tooling and infrastructure to all these startups that are [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1484.72s)]
*  building applications for consumers and business users. Or they will end up doing a massive deal [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1488.32s)]
*  with Microsoft. I think it's inevitable they're going to get a billion dollar plus investment [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1493.84s)]
*  this year. They could power AI driven Bing search and voice driven search. They could build their [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1496.8s)]
*  own products and their own tools and they're becoming great investors. They invested in [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1503.52s)]
*  Descript, which is a product company we use here for our podcast, which is an incredible product. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1506.96s)]
*  I think that Sam Altman is a very smart and intrude investor as well. For a lot of reasons, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1512.48s)]
*  I think open AI could end up having an amazing year this year and a lot of different paths they [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1516.88s)]
*  could walk. We're going to come out of this year and say they're one of the top tech companies in [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1521.52s)]
*  the Valley. Okay. Saks, open AI has of course increased your ability to talk to other humans. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1524.4s)]
*  So you're seeing a lot of big wins there. I know. How do I talk to a child about their college hopes [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1532.8s)]
*  and aspirations? No, no, no. How do I talk to a child about their day? Hello. Hello. Hello progeny [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1542.8799999999999s)]
*  of mine. How are you faring today in this complicated? Chat TTT. Write me a script of talking to a 12 year [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1552.6399999999999s)]
*  old about their hopes and dreams. That's interesting. Using GPT for talking points on different [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1559.68s)]
*  topics. We should try that for the pod. Oh, okay. We should have done the GPT predictions. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1565.2s)]
*  That would be great. Have GPT make its answer. Saks as a person on the spectrum, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1571.52s)]
*  yeah, how delightful is this chat GPT and your treatment of your condition? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1577.44s)]
*  That's great. Let me get to my answer here. So my answer for the big business winner of the year [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1583.44s)]
*  is America's natural gas industry. And I have to admit this is an aspect of the Ukraine war [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1589.8400000000001s)]
*  that I didn't fully appreciate until I read this New York Times article the other day about how [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1596.0s)]
*  natural gas prices in Europe have now fallen to the level they're at before the war. And everyone [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1602.0s)]
*  thought that there'd be this huge shortage and they wouldn't be able to heat their homes. Well, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1607.8400000000001s)]
*  what happened? The answer is that Europe completely cut off their dependence on Russian [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1612.16s)]
*  gas. And in fact, the Nord Stream pipelines were blown up. So physically they separated. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1618.88s)]
*  But then on top of it, they basically started importing liquefied natural gas from the US. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1624.64s)]
*  And here's the key paragraph in this article from the New York Times is that [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1631.92s)]
*  Europe rapidly built terminals to receive liquefied gas, sweeping away many of the [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1636.4s)]
*  usual bureaucratic obstacles and environmental objections. So in other words, what normally [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1640.96s)]
*  would have taken decades to get approvals now was all put on a fast track. And Europe is now [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1647.04s)]
*  completely dependent on American natural gas. And I think this is, again, the thing maybe I [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1653.28s)]
*  underestimated the cold hard American interest in this war is to basically turn Europe into a vassal [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1660.48s)]
*  of America's natural gas industry. Previously, they were about to be dependent on Russia and [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1668.6399999999999s)]
*  Nord Stream was going to make that situation permanent. Somebody blew up Nord Stream. Now [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1673.84s)]
*  they're dependent on American LNG. They're going to pay higher prices for that. But it's been [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1679.1999999999998s)]
*  a pretty impressive win for the American natural gas industry. And I think Biden [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1685.76s)]
*  has really pulled a 180 here because you remember when he first came into office, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1690.32s)]
*  he canceled Keystone, he canceled drilling. He was very tough on the oil and gas industry. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1694.72s)]
*  I think after he then delivered the hundreds of billions for the climate special interest [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1699.84s)]
*  and the Inflation Reduction Act, now he is taking care of the oil and gas industry. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1705.44s)]
*  I love it. Here we go. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1709.68s)]
*  So 180 flip by Biden. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1710.72s)]
*  Yeah. And so what you're saying is Biden dynamically changed course based on inputs [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1712.08s)]
*  like a great leader would. Okay. Well done, Zach. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1717.44s)]
*  Well, I don't, I don't listen. I don't know if this- [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1720.0s)]
*  How choking would you be? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1721.52s)]
*  Well, no, listen, I think Biden has done something politically smart here. There's no [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1722.56s)]
*  question about it. I am giving him credit. Does it mean that this war was worth it? No, I don't, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1726.48s)]
*  I don't think we should be engaging in oil wars like we did in the Middle East. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1731.12s)]
*  So I'm not justifying this war, but I am saying that there is a cold hard American interest [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1736.1599999999999s)]
*  undergirding our position, which is it's about LNG. It's not, it's not just about moral platitudes. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1741.6s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, listen- [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1748.3999999999999s)]
*  Strong start to 2023, vassal and undergirding. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1749.04s)]
*  My biggest predictions, I'm working backwards from two here. I think the DoorDash is Airbnb's, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1753.52s)]
*  Uber's, Etsy's of the world who need entrepreneurs. They need workers. They need supply. They've [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1759.12s)]
*  always been supply constrained. As unemployment becomes, let's call it what it is, sticky. You're [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1764.32s)]
*  going to see a lot more people participating in gig platforms or entrepreneurial platforms that [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1770.56s)]
*  enable them to make money. So I think they will be huge beneficiaries, especially if they continue [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1774.3999999999999s)]
*  to lay off employees like DoorDash and Airbnb did to right size their businesses. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1778.48s)]
*  But my first one, my number one is laid off tech workers. I think laid off tech workers who [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1782.56s)]
*  get together in groups of two, three or four developers, product managers, people who actually [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1791.52s)]
*  build stuff and start companies together are going to become extremely successful. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1796.1599999999999s)]
*  And they're going to make incredible lemonade from these lemons of these big tech layoffs. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1801.76s)]
*  So I think the startup space is again, and these laid off tech workers who choose to take control [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1806.96s)]
*  of the destiny and starts companies are going to be the true big winners. If you do it, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1810.88s)]
*  do it with two or three friends because you're going to need developers. You're going to need [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1815.0400000000002s)]
*  those talented people in the startups that have three founders get funded faster than the ones [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1819.0400000000002s)]
*  with one. So those are my two winners. All right. Oh yeah. And last year, our biggest business [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1823.92s)]
*  winners were Chamath said SMB, Sachs said Rise of the Rest, Friedberg said Stripe, and I said Disney [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1828.8000000000002s)]
*  Millennials and Gen Z. Let's go on to biggest business loser for 2023, Friedberg. Who do you [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1833.6000000000001s)]
*  think will be the biggest business loser in 23 this year? In fact, okay. So my biggest loser [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1840.16s)]
*  is the general category of capital intensive series B through D growth businesses in the startup [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1845.44s)]
*  landscape, private companies. As you guys know, there's been a big shift in capital allocation. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1851.76s)]
*  A lot of the folks who were writing big checks into growth rounds are retreating back to writing [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1858.4s)]
*  smaller checks and seed and a rounds. They don't want to write the $20 million series B. They want [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1864.16s)]
*  to write the $5 million seed and a round. No one wants to kind of follow the valuation. No one [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1868.56s)]
*  wants to set the valuation for these growth businesses, particularly if after this round, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1873.28s)]
*  you know you need another big round of capital and no one's sure if someone's going to be waiting [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1878.0s)]
*  on the other end. As a result, we're seeing tons of these businesses run into capital confusion walls. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1881.84s)]
*  They can't pivot. I think we'll see what we saw in the dot com bubble where 99 and a half percent [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1887.6799999999998s)]
*  of these companies actually die. The half percent that we are going to emerge as the next hundred [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1893.12s)]
*  billion enterprises, the Googles and the Amazons of the world. There will be light at the end of [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1897.04s)]
*  the tunnel for the winners, but generally there are hundreds of companies in hardware, in CINBio, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1901.04s)]
*  in biotech, in high growth enterprise software that require significant sales investment expense. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1906.32s)]
*  A lot of these businesses where the capital intensive nature of the business [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1912.24s)]
*  just doesn't have the market for it right now and investors are all retreating and they're [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1916.32s)]
*  going to be selective. That's where I think there's going to be more capital intensive. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1921.28s)]
*  By the way, seed and A investing, hot as a button. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1925.5200000000002s)]
*  B plus. Chef's kiss. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1928.96s)]
*  That's it. Okay, Sachs, biggest business loser for 2023. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1929.92s)]
*  Well, I just, by the way, 100% agree with what Freeberg said, but my biggest [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1935.6000000000001s)]
*  loser for business in 23 is the consumer. I just don't understand how the consumer isn't going to [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1939.2800000000002s)]
*  finally tap out in this economy. I mean, they have a mountain of personal debt, credit card [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1946.0s)]
*  debts at all time highs. I think the average credit card rate hit 19.6% last week and is expected [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1951.28s)]
*  to rise even further. The mortgage rates are about 7% now, so forget about trying to buy a new home [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1957.84s)]
*  or sell your home and your stock portfolio is down too and now layoffs are starting to pile up. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1964.96s)]
*  I just don't understand how we're going to avoid a recession. You saw Kashkari saying that the Fed's [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1970.56s)]
*  going to keep raising 5.4% is his prediction. I don't understand how if rates are at 5.5%, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1976.08s)]
*  that doesn't finally break the back of this economy and we go into recession. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1983.4399999999998s)]
*  Do you think Sachs that the economy is actually broken right now? We just don't have the data [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1987.6s)]
*  because the data lags 60 days in most people's minds because it does feel like the consumer [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1991.9199999999998s)]
*  is just, and real estate has just broken at this very moment. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1996.1599999999999s)]
*  It seems like it. I mean, the pain is very unequal, right? But in the tech industry, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=1999.28s)]
*  we've been in a recession for a year. I mean, the growth stocks are down 80%. What Friedberg said [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2002.88s)]
*  is true. No one's going to fund these high-burning companies. There's an enormous amount of retooling [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2008.0s)]
*  that has to happen. Look, I think the recession is here. It's just very unequally- [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2013.0400000000002s)]
*  Distributed. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2017.5200000000002s)]
*  Distributed, exactly. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2018.4s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, if you look at it, buy now, pay later, that's the category starting to break. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2019.5200000000002s)]
*  Credit card debt, as you're saying, hitting big bad records in terms of how much we love spending [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2024.64s)]
*  also people's savings are going down. So the consumer's back has been broken. I think we're [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2032.88s)]
*  just going to feel it in the first and second quarter. Chamath, who's your biggest business [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2038.16s)]
*  loser prediction for 2023? The world wants to know. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2042.8000000000002s)]
*  Let me just build on what Friedberg and Sack said for a second before I give you my pick. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2045.2s)]
*  Sure. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2049.76s)]
*  This is the conversation you and I had when we just got on. Guys, what I was telling JCal is at [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2050.56s)]
*  the end of Q4, I did five deals and four were pro-ratas, one was a new deal. And they were all [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2054.56s)]
*  clean markups. So the four deals that other people put money into. And I was looking at them and I [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2064.72s)]
*  was trying to figure out, okay, what differentiates these things? And Friedberg, to your point, these [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2071.52s)]
*  were super clean startups with very clean cap tables that had clear progress. And then conversely, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2075.04s)]
*  I had seven converts showed to me for companies whose valuations were anywhere between three and [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2081.44s)]
*  I would say 12 billion. And I did none of them. And not only did I do none of them, nobody else [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2088.48s)]
*  did any of them. And the problem was the real market clearing price was 80 to 90% down. And so [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2094.7200000000003s)]
*  I was like, what is going on here? So, Friedberg, to your point, I don't even think it's just cash [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2103.2000000000003s)]
*  intensive startups. I think it's like all growth companies are in a really bad place. I thought [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2107.44s)]
*  that this growth stuff would get sorted out in two to three months. And now I'm worried it's two to [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2112.08s)]
*  three years. I think it's toxic. Here's the definition, Chamath. What I think has happened [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2116.48s)]
*  and where I think the cutoff is, is when the implied market valuation of the company based [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2123.28s)]
*  on where public comps are trading is less than the total capital preference in the company, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2128.4s)]
*  the total preferred stock. Wow. So many companies now that raised 400 million or two billion [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2132.8s)]
*  valuation, but the company is actually worth 300 million now based on public market comps. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2137.2s)]
*  So they're worth less than their preference stack. So how do you sort through that? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2142.3999999999996s)]
*  No, that this is why I think all these converts are getting done. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2147.6s)]
*  That's where the rubber meets the road on all these deals. Yeah, that's right. Who does the [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2151.04s)]
*  convert benefit? The convert benefits, the VCs who want to maintain the illusory valuation that they [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2154.48s)]
*  had before. They do that. They do that to assuage the limited partner who gave them money [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2163.2s)]
*  that the marks aren't as bad as they thought. But the people that really get screwed, as Jason said, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2170.24s)]
*  are the common shareholders because eventually those converts deals that do get done, those people [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2175.8399999999997s)]
*  will end up owning the company. The cap table gets completely flushed and reset and the employees [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2181.68s)]
*  get wiped out. Yeah. And then you got to basically take all the employees who were there previously, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2187.12s)]
*  who now hate the founder and you got to start over and give everybody all the, yeah, they're [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2191.68s)]
*  wiped. The people to do all the work get fucked and the people who do none of the work and who [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2196.0s)]
*  just want to maintain this shell game gets to basically live another day. Basically people [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2199.9199999999996s)]
*  are investing as you gave in the example earlier, like, Hey, if it's a $3 billion company, but it's [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2205.04s)]
*  actually worth 750 people instead of taking the valuation from 3 billion to 750, we'll say, okay, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2209.12s)]
*  buy one share at the $3 billion price and we'll give you three or four shares for free or for a [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2214.24s)]
*  penny warrants they're called typically, or, you know, just different ways to structure this. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2218.64s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, nobody knows the actual denominator. They may own them 10,000 shares, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2223.68s)]
*  but they don't know how many shares are actually issued because the warrants are not on the cap [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2228.24s)]
*  table. They're in some side document in a folder in a lawyer or CFO's office. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2231.6s)]
*  So let me, let me tell you my biggest business loser. Yes, please. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2235.52s)]
*  I think that the biggest potential business loser this year is Google search as measured by [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2239.7599999999998s)]
*  your profitability and engagement. I think it's easier for me to see where the, the usage comes [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2247.76s)]
*  from, as opposed to picking open AI or chat GPT in terms of where the usage goes to. And the reason [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2258.88s)]
*  is because I think a lot of people don't still fully understand how machine learning and AI work, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2264.88s)]
*  but just 30 second primer, there's two big buckets of work. There's what's called learning, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2270.96s)]
*  which is how you learn how to make predictions. And then there's what's called inference, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2276.8s)]
*  which is when you actually type something into the search box, you get the answer. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2281.1200000000003s)]
*  The thing with learning and what chat GPT is showing is that they have learned by crawling [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2285.2000000000003s)]
*  the entirety of the web. There are five or six other organizations that are capable of crawling [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2291.36s)]
*  the entire web in terms of cost, in terms of compute, in terms of the quality of the [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2296.8s)]
*  transformers and the quality of the AI. And so I find it easier to predict [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2301.84s)]
*  the decay in the quality of Google search as that much better than everybody else. Then I find it [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2309.76s)]
*  is to predict who will win because I think that with enough time and money, Oracle, Microsoft, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2315.44s)]
*  Google, the Chinese internet companies can all compete Facebook. And so I think that you'll [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2321.2000000000003s)]
*  converge on the same training, which will lead to the same inference. And so I think consumers [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2330.32s)]
*  end up getting confused and we'll end up being able to get high quality search results from many [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2334.8s)]
*  places versus today. You know, you wouldn't only think that Google is the only game in town, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2339.28s)]
*  quite honestly, for most people. Well, I think that's statistics show that Google could lose 10 [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2344.2400000000002s)]
*  or 15% of usage to all these other sites. And that may not make any of those sites that relevant, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2349.04s)]
*  but it'll have a material measurable impact to Google and Google. Fantastic prediction. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2354.88s)]
*  And I think, you know, chat, CPT, or these other ones are going to have a very interesting marketing [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2359.84s)]
*  attack that they can do on Google is why search when you can get an answer, right? Hey, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2365.44s)]
*  we'll just give you the answer. You don't have to search. I had so many losers that I went through [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2369.6000000000004s)]
*  here. I'm just going to run backwards through them. Number five, I thought founders who refused to [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2373.84s)]
*  downsize in 2022 could be big losers in 2023. How do you get to have five in the rest of us? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2377.76s)]
*  Or just tell you my thought process. I just had a long hair. Your thought process. I thought VC [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2382.0s)]
*  funds founded in 2020. Then I thought crypto because Gary Gensler says it's all stock. Then [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2387.76s)]
*  I went with you, Chamath. Number four, Google. My god, they got so many headwinds against them [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2391.92s)]
*  with the chat GPT. But I wound up on white collar workers with no hard skills. Twitter going down [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2396.2400000000002s)]
*  to I think, you know, Elon said a couple of hundred people is all you need to run Twitter. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2404.0s)]
*  And I think he said he has 2000 employees or something like that. He has shown everybody, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2407.6000000000004s)]
*  you know, hey, listen, these more can be done with less, or these things are overstaffed in a massive [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2411.76s)]
*  way. I think white collar workers now, the idea that you're going to have four offers, and you're [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2416.88s)]
*  going to be able to play them off each other is over. When we take the show, it's surplus elites, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2421.36s)]
*  sure. White collar workers, aka surplus elites, people who actually, you know, are mid managers [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2427.12s)]
*  who don't, who don't actually code or don't actually build a product or sell a product, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2431.36s)]
*  don't actually do real work. As I think many people would frame it in the manager class or [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2435.76s)]
*  the CEO class, man, they're gonna have a hard time. And this week, Andy, Amazon Andy cut 18,000 [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2441.52s)]
*  white collar workers, not the blue collar, the white collar workers in Amazon, that was a big [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2449.28s)]
*  turning point. And Benny off, you know, he's Ohana, he is Mahalo, he is Aloha, he does not like to lay [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2453.52s)]
*  people off he considers Salesforce or family, he laid off 8000. I predicted that. Yeah. And I mean, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2460.24s)]
*  that is to me about that. Well, I mean, the reason is pretty simple, right? Their growth slowed down [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2466.48s)]
*  by two thirds of the most recent quarter, but they're still spending the same amount of sales [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2470.8s)]
*  and marketing. So when that happens, your CAC payback explodes, right? You go from three years [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2474.32s)]
*  payback to like 10 years. So they have to cut costs in order to rationalize your unique economics. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2480.1600000000003s)]
*  So and now it cascades, right? Because all of Salesforce's vendors are going to be getting [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2485.6800000000003s)]
*  less money from Salesforce, because they're tightening their belts. So then those companies [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2491.6800000000003s)]
*  are gonna have to cut and the cycle just keeps going and going. Right. And everybody tightens [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2496.08s)]
*  their belts at the same time, freezes the economy aka recession, and possibly were so that mine was [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2501.36s)]
*  a surplus elite. So that's a nice little quartet. In 2022, just so you know, I picked crypto, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2507.52s)]
*  Freeberg also picked crypto, Chimot said Visa MasterCard and SAC said, assets classes that [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2513.44s)]
*  benefit from government dumps and liquidity. Yeah. All right, let's go to biggest business deal of [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2517.84s)]
*  2023. It's a prediction. What do we think could be the biggest business? Easy, easy. This one. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2525.12s)]
*  Okay, Chamath, go. Let's go. I'm right here. Good. Chamath quickly. Starlink will go public. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2529.2s)]
*  SpaceX will cut and paste the cap table. And we will take yum yum, it'll be yummy and delicious. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2533.92s)]
*  And my prediction is that the Starlink valuation will be at least half of SpaceX's current private [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2541.12s)]
*  marks 75 Billy, just 75 billion, it will be phenomenal. And I think the reason why is that [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2547.04s)]
*  I think in order for Elon to have complete financial flexibility and do what he needs to do, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2553.84s)]
*  and you know, he talked about this on our pod about the difficulties and the dangers of margin [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2559.6800000000003s)]
*  loans and all of that stuff. Yes, he's gonna create breathing room for himself. Ah, this is the [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2563.92s)]
*  simplest and most obvious way for him to do it. It'll give him a ton of more dry powder. Sure. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2569.6800000000003s)]
*  So I think that this is an obvious outcome in 2020. They already have a million subscribers in [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2575.36s)]
*  there better than nothing beta as they call it. I have two of them. I think this is a great, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2581.28s)]
*  great I was the first one to get it for for the global 7500. So okay, I got it for [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2586.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, so more. So there's a plane in your house in the same size. Yeah, exactly. So there [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2594.7200000000003s)]
*  you go. There is a point here. People are underestimating the TAM I think of this product. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2601.0400000000004s)]
*  The TAM is not existing broadband connections. It's second connections. It's connections [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2606.88s)]
*  where connections didn't exist. Just so you know, the best in class, the best in class broadband [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2611.04s)]
*  connection for a plane is called Ka band. And it costs 500 grand a year. That's ridiculous. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2617.2799999999997s)]
*  And you can replace it for, you know, a 10th of the cost and Starlink on a plane is dramatically [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2624.16s)]
*  better by directionally. So I think Starlink is going to go public. And I think it's going to be [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2631.12s)]
*  the best chance that we have of opening up the capital markets in 2023. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2637.6000000000004s)]
*  There's another way of saying people who own private jets, if they are flying 250 hours a year, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2641.2000000000003s)]
*  which would probably be a reasonable number to 300 hours a year, they're paying $2,000 an hour for [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2646.7200000000003s)]
*  their internet service. That is bonkers. Okay, sacks. Who is your big deal? Biggest business [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2652.0s)]
*  deal prediction? Biggest deal 23 prediction is there will be a deal between Putin and G. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2657.84s)]
*  And they met by satellite late last week to discuss ways to further help each other in 2023. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2666.96s)]
*  Putin characterizes as a no limits partnership. You may remember that the two of them inked a [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2674.0800000000004s)]
*  $175 billion gas deal in early February last year. That was three weeks before Putin invaded Ukraine. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2680.6400000000003s)]
*  I think now Russia is even more dependent on China. We've really driven Russia into China's arms. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2687.28s)]
*  And I think there will be a big deal not just on energy, but on agricultural products, mineral [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2694.24s)]
*  products, and rare earth minerals that, you know, Chamath likes to talk about. I think there could [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2700.64s)]
*  be a trillion dollar deal between Russia and China this year. First, we go out in the limb, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2707.3599999999997s)]
*  make prediction. Okay, so there is your 2023 prediction of the biggest deal, the Legion of [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2712.3199999999997s)]
*  Dictators is forming. I do think it's, it is like, you know, that the axis of evil, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2717.36s)]
*  this is more Legion of Dictators, like, hey, let's do business together. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2722.88s)]
*  Freeberg, you got a prediction for the biggest business deal of 2023. This is really going out [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2726.48s)]
*  on limb here. I'll do two real quick. The first was the similar to what Sack said, but it's [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2730.4s)]
*  kind of echoing what I said earlier, which is the Petro Yuan trade. I think that's the Saudi [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2738.6400000000003s)]
*  China trade. If this happens and oil is sold in Yuan, it marks the beginning of, I think, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2743.6s)]
*  the end of the assumption that the US dollar is the global reserve and the risk-free currency [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2753.36s)]
*  in reserve for the world. So I think the Petro Yuan trade, if you guys, here's the Reuters article [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2761.44s)]
*  covering Xi's visit to Saudi Arabia last month, first, second week of December. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2767.68s)]
*  Once this gets inked and signed, it's a real shift globally. I think the other one that I'm [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2773.2s)]
*  going to point out that I think is a bit of a out of left field one, maybe, and maybe I'm just [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2778.8799999999997s)]
*  going to look like a total idiot at the end of the year. But do a wild card. This is my wild card. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2785.2799999999997s)]
*  So my wild card is I think Apple ends up buying something completely out of the ordinary. And [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2788.7999999999997s)]
*  here's why. I think Apple's core business, they're facing significant pressure with respect to their [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2793.84s)]
*  relationship and ties to China. As you guys may have seen last week, Foxconn announced that [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2798.48s)]
*  they're actually going further downstream in terms of their production model, and they're [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2803.52s)]
*  trying to diversify away from being kind of the sole service provider to Apple. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2807.76s)]
*  Apple, as you know, is under such pressure to get out of China [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2811.84s)]
*  politically that they've started to try and invigorate activity in Vietnam and elsewhere. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2815.84s)]
*  So a lot of pressure on their relationship with their low cost producer and low cost production [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2820.32s)]
*  partner. They're also under a lot of political pressure because of the App Store revenues. You [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2826.1600000000003s)]
*  guys know this 30% App Store thing that they take. A lot of people are calling it monopolistic and [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2831.6000000000004s)]
*  antitrust is getting involved. So they're feeling that pressure. There's also the pressure with [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2836.2400000000002s)]
*  respect to the waning consumer demand for high end electronics. Samsung last yesterday or last week, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2839.92s)]
*  announced significant declines in consumer demand for electronics or their forecast as such. That [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2847.92s)]
*  has to impact Apple as well. So when you put all of this together, they're being pressured to get [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2853.92s)]
*  out of their low cost manufacturing center. They're being pressured to stop making money on the App [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2859.44s)]
*  Store. They're being pressured because the demand may be waning. They have to do something big to [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2863.2s)]
*  kind of diversify the business. So I think they might end up doing something like buying a real [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2868.48s)]
*  content company. Maybe they do something like buy a Disney. Maybe they do something like [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2871.84s)]
*  buy an automotive company like Fiat Chrysler. I think there are a number of these kind of like, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2876.88s)]
*  what may seem today outrageous deals that Apple might end up kind of being pressured into doing [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2881.52s)]
*  so that they can get ahead of their forecast of the impact that all these pressures are going to [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2886.88s)]
*  have on their core business. And so I think this is something interesting to kind of think may [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2890.88s)]
*  happen this year. I certainly have no insight or intel on anything or I could be completely wrong [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2894.88s)]
*  on this one, but it feels like they've got to do something this year. I mean, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2899.92s)]
*  I already keep that business. I think this is I think I love your wild card because the MBS [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2902.88s)]
*  China trade and that relationship sure legion of dictators, but this one is really good. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2907.44s)]
*  It's hard to buy Disney monopolistic issues, but buying a car company pretty easy because [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2913.6s)]
*  that's a fragmented market. I love this prediction. I mean, now with Tesla with this depressed stock [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2919.12s)]
*  price, Apple can make a run at Tesla to have they could almost buy it with cash. Let alone BMW, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2924.56s)]
*  Volvo, one of those brands they could buy easily. What a great prediction for me. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2929.44s)]
*  The prediction is Amazon's three legged stool grows into a sturdy chair with a fourth pillar. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2934.64s)]
*  For those folks who are not familiar with how Amazon has built their businesses, there are three [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2941.12s)]
*  pillars in their stool, e-commerce, obviously when you buy stuff, prime memberships, which is kind [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2947.2000000000003s)]
*  of considered a separate revenue stream. And of course, AWS cloud computing. I think the fourth [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2952.08s)]
*  is going to be this continuation of following the health stream, not advertising because that's not [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2957.76s)]
*  a consumer based product. That's just the way they make money. Health is going to be a big one for [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2962.1600000000003s)]
*  them. They obviously acquired one medical, which was a small purchase. I think they're going to [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2966.1600000000003s)]
*  buy Roman hymns. They're going to buy Peloton. They could buy a whoop and they're going to go [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2970.6400000000003s)]
*  all in on health. And you know, that three legged stool becomes a very sturdy chair. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2976.0800000000004s)]
*  And my runner up is TikTok is going to divest under duress. I think that it's going to have [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2981.5200000000004s)]
*  to go public and the Chinese are going to divest their interest in it and just take their chips [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2987.28s)]
*  because they're going to be faced with the existential threat during the political debates [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2992.6400000000003s)]
*  of the next two years. There will be anonymous support from Democrats and Republicans to get [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=2996.0800000000004s)]
*  TikTok out of the U S therefore they divest. Can I just test that with you guys? Cause we've talked [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3001.36s)]
*  about this a lot that, Hey, we're going to ban TikTok. How many of your friends, kids or your [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3006.7200000000003s)]
*  kids do you guys know spend hours a week on TikTok? It's a lot. 90%. How do you get over [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3013.52s)]
*  the political mountain of trying to ban TikTok? If you try and ban TikTok, whoever raises their [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3020.32s)]
*  hand and says we should ban TikTok and actually gets it done, they're out of office. There is [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3026.4s)]
*  going to be so much pressure and backlash because people are hooked and love that app and use it [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3030.56s)]
*  all the time to take that away from people will feel like this kind of young kids that don't have [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3034.16s)]
*  phones actually get everything that TikTok has on YouTube shorts. So I don't think TikTok is [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3039.84s)]
*  that important because it is not actually, there is no sticky network effect inside that app. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3045.52s)]
*  So there isn't usage that's dependent on people, you know, or a graph that you build. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3050.88s)]
*  It's a lot of passively consumed content. And so, you know, you're, you're getting pushed a lot of [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3055.44s)]
*  algorithmically defined content. You can do that on YouTube. And so I actually don't think it's that [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3060.96s)]
*  meaningfully important if TikTok goes away. I think the content creators stay. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3065.12s)]
*  It's harder for them to build a business on YouTube shorts. But if you look at the [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3070.72s)]
*  measure, the density of content inside TikTok, it exists almost one to one on YouTube. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3076.4s)]
*  That's interesting. It's an interesting point. You think it'll be okay if we cancel TikTok in [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3082.88s)]
*  the US and we say that's it, you can't have TikTok anymore. It'll be disruptive, but people will just [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3087.44s)]
*  go to YouTube and Instagram. It's not that big of a deal. In fact, a lot of the my favorites, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3092.0s)]
*  if there was a network effect inside there, then I think people would have a reason to complain to [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3097.36s)]
*  somebody, whether it's your representative or whether it's somebody else to say, hey, don't do [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3102.24s)]
*  this, this would have a deleterious impact on my quality of life or my quality of experience. And [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3106.88s)]
*  you could make that clear claim on Instagram, Facebook, you know, Google, YouTube. But TikTok [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3112.24s)]
*  is much more brittle that way. And that's why they need to get public sooner and monetize this [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3119.68s)]
*  bloody thing. Because I think that it's very easy, actually, to deconstruct TikTok's value [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3124.7200000000003s)]
*  into these other places. I can tell you my favorite TikTok is Chef's Reactions. And I consume him now [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3132.56s)]
*  on Instagram because he posts, he just copies one to the other. And so Chef's Reactions is a great [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3137.92s)]
*  example where he actually got banned by TikTok and then diversified on his own. And now what he does [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3142.96s)]
*  is he publishes across multiple streams. And if you look at all the big creators, they all do that [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3148.32s)]
*  because it makes no sense to actually give the power to any one of these things. Why have a [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3153.76s)]
*  dependency? Why have a dependency? All right, let's keep the trains moving. Most contrarian belief, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3157.6800000000003s)]
*  this is the Peter Thiel Award, your chess partner, Sax. Who's winning in 2022 in chess? How many [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3163.52s)]
*  chess games do you have going with Peter Thiel right now? And who's higher rated? You demolished [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3170.0s)]
*  me with your Queen's Gambit. I played one game, I got killed in seven moves. I'm ranked at 800, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3173.7599999999998s)]
*  900 right now. Sax is at 1800. He just walloped me. Who's higher rated right now? You or Peter Thiel? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3179.52s)]
*  You accepted the Queen's Gambit. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3184.56s)]
*  Well, you know, I just, I didn't even know what it was. I was like, what opening is this? You're like, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3185.9199999999996s)]
*  Queen's Gambit, you're dead. Boom. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3190.16s)]
*  Queen's Gambit accepted. You don't want to accept the Queen's Gambit. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3192.3999999999996s)]
*  It's a very pleasant game for white. I'm going to go on the limb here, you know, and risk being [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3196.16s)]
*  wrong. My prediction, or most contrarian belief is that the bromance between Biden and Zelensky [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3201.28s)]
*  comes to an end at some point in 2023. And let me state the part that I think is conventional [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3208.7200000000003s)]
*  wisdom and everyone agrees with, which is there's going to be a massive Ukrainian counteroffensive [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3216.32s)]
*  in the spring. And I think that could go one of two ways. Either it could make limited gains, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3221.1200000000003s)]
*  basically the Russians fight them to a stalemate, or it could be successful. And they could basically [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3226.24s)]
*  push the Russians back to the February 23rd lines and make a play for Crimea. I predict that in [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3232.16s)]
*  either one of those circumstances, Zelensky's interests and Biden's interests will start to [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3237.2799999999997s)]
*  diverge. So in the case of a stalemate, which I think is probably 50-50 here, Biden's got to [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3242.16s)]
*  start going into election mode for 2024. And I think we're saying there were going to be [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3249.8399999999997s)]
*  a recession. So I think that if there's a stalemate, I think Biden's going to tell Zelensky, [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3253.52s)]
*  wrap this thing up, it's time to negotiate, we need to get this over with. By the same token, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3258.64s)]
*  if the counteroffensive is successful, I think that the administration, hopefully cooler heads [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3263.84s)]
*  will prevail and not let them take Crimea. That's basically what they're gunning for, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3268.32s)]
*  is they not only want to get back to the February 23rd lines, they want to go all the way back to [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3272.8s)]
*  the 2014 lines of retaking Crimea. I think that's extremely dangerous. I think that could precipitate [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3276.88s)]
*  a nuclear war. And I think that the cooler heads in the administration will tell Zelensky to stand [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3283.36s)]
*  down and that's the right time to make a deal. So I think in either one of these scenarios, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3288.56s)]
*  I think you will start to see a divergence between the Ukrainian and the American interests, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3292.96s)]
*  and that could create a rift. And I think no one's really predicting that. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3297.04s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell I think this is great. This is kind of what I thought the plan all along was, [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3301.6s)]
*  which was to deplete Putin of resources, distract him, and then get the West off of his oil and try [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3305.52s)]
*  to do regime change, but do it by bleeding him. This would be a proof positive of that strategy, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3312.64s)]
*  which is bleed him to the end and then sell Zelensky out. I think that's actually, I know [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3318.08s)]
*  it's cynical, but I think that's what we're doing. I think Ukraine is a tool to deplete Putin and then [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3323.68s)]
*  maybe get to regime change. I'm cynical as it gets with this. Chamath, what's your most [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3328.64s)]
*  contrarian belief of 2023? Chamath Pichai [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3332.88s)]
*  I will go and pick that inflation, which people expect to fall off a cliff, doesn't fall off a [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3335.6800000000003s)]
*  cliff as fast or as meaningfully as people want. And so I will explain inflation as [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3345.2000000000003s)]
*  three different chapters. And we've seen the first two chapters play out. So 2021, [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3353.44s)]
*  chapter one was all about energy inflation. And you know, we all talked about having almost $10 gas [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3358.8s)]
*  at the pump. And what does it mean for everybody? And it caused that initial spike in inflation. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3364.96s)]
*  And then we had it come off and Sachs called us, he said, you know, we're going to have this sort of [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3373.84s)]
*  double hump. And 2022 was really the story of goods inflation, right? All these prices and all of [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3378.0800000000004s)]
*  these things went up because the input costs went up and we all had to bear the implications of that. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3384.64s)]
*  But then that started to ebb. Now, if you looked at the tail end of 2022, what I found super [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3391.3599999999997s)]
*  interesting was the number of articles I saw about wage inflation, whether that was Biden using an [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3398.3199999999997s)]
*  1800s era law to prevent a railroad strike, the number of states that increased minimum wage, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3407.3599999999997s)]
*  the trend around unionization. So in general, my thought is that the pendulum is swinging [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3414.72s)]
*  very markedly away from capital and towards labor. And as the labor participation rate stays low and [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3422.0s)]
*  continues to go down, and also it's compounded by an unemployment rate that may go up, right, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3429.2s)]
*  people are, it's going to be harder and harder to get people to do the work you need at the company [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3435.2799999999997s)]
*  you have unless you pay them more. And if that gets exaggerated, then inflation will stay where [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3440.72s)]
*  it is, it won't be as muted and it won't fall off a cliff as people want. That's my big contrarian [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3448.64s)]
*  wager for this year is that we see wage inflation that keeps inflation not going down as much as [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3456.7999999999997s)]
*  people want. This is contrarian because everybody's saying, hey, it's over, the consumer's back has [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3463.9199999999996s)]
*  been broken, the credit card debt is high, and everybody's being laid off, yada, yada, yada. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3468.72s)]
*  Therefore, goods and services, there'll be more supply than demand and the prices will lower. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3474.24s)]
*  Very contrarian, free break, do you have a contrarian belief for 2023? [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3479.68s)]
*  I think it follows my earlier points about the Saudi, China, Russia trade. This year exiting 2023, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3483.04s)]
*  it may be the case that there's historically been this belief and this continuing belief that the [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3495.28s)]
*  US dollar will always be the de facto global reserve currency. And the current mantra is that [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3502.7200000000003s)]
*  it's better than the rest. Everyone else is worse off than the US. Western Europe is in trouble, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3507.84s)]
*  Japan is in trouble, China's in trouble, everyone's in trouble. But if there is a coalition, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3511.44s)]
*  an economic coalition, a scaled economic coalition that starts to shift the balance of power a little [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3517.92s)]
*  bit, and the US meanwhile is taking on extraordinary debt load, spending $1.7 trillion in an omnibus bill, [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3524.72s)]
*  has this massive unfunded social security problem coming down the pipe, and are trying to manage [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3533.52s)]
*  multiple funded conflicts around the world, it could be that the US dollar coming out of 2023 [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3538.64s)]
*  starts to trade more like a risk asset and less like a risk-free asset. And so I think that that's [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3544.9599999999996s)]
*  my big contrarian bet is that maybe this year marks the beginning of the end of the US dollar [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3550.0s)]
*  as the kind of global de facto reserve currency based on some of these big trades that I talked [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3555.44s)]
*  about happening. So that would be my big kind of contrarian. Perfectly said, that's your contrarian [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3562.4s)]
*  bet. The Legion of Dictators, the MBSs, et cetera, they form a new global currency. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3569.12s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I wouldn't say Legion of Dictators and I wouldn't say forming a new global currency, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3575.84s)]
*  but I do think that the fact that large economic trading models start to be done in non-dollar [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3581.6000000000004s)]
*  denominated form weakens the kind of reserve status of the dollar to some degree, not fully, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3590.4s)]
*  right? It doesn't happen in a binary way. And then the dollar starts to trade more like a risk asset [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3596.6400000000003s)]
*  like other currencies do to some degree, not fully. So maybe this year we start to see that shift. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3600.64s)]
*  Once again, I take the exact opposite of your contrarian belief. I believe American exceptionalism [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3606.72s)]
*  continues to soar as Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, to a lesser extent, continue to self-sabotage [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3611.92s)]
*  themselves with insane wars like Putin has done or cutting off the heads of entrepreneurs in China, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3618.4s)]
*  figuratively I'm saying here. I think you cannot have exceptionalism without entrepreneurs, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3625.36s)]
*  without people having freedom. And I think that means American exceptionalism based on freedom [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3631.6s)]
*  is going to continue. And the Legion of Dictators, I believe, are going to stab each other in the back [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3637.84s)]
*  before they change the world or move the currency. Can't trust them. They'll snip at each other. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3643.6s)]
*  And all their self-sabotage. Where do you fall on our opposite? [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3649.2000000000003s)]
*  I think that America is really feeling its Wheaties right now. I think that American [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3653.6s)]
*  power is immense. I think that the superiority of our weapons in Ukraine has been one of the [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3657.92s)]
*  big surprises of the war. Let's go, Pomo Lucky. I don't see the world in the simplistic good guys [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3663.2s)]
*  versus bad guys frame that Jacob does. However, America is on turbo right now. And yes, it is true [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3669.2799999999997s)]
*  that the BRICS would love to get off of the dollar because we are now using the dollar and the [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3675.92s)]
*  financial system and Swift as a geopolitical tool and a weapon. And they would very much like to be [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3682.16s)]
*  off of our dependence on our currency. But I don't think they're anywhere close to be able to do that [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3688.24s)]
*  yet. And like I said, America is on turbo right now. Now, one thing I want to mention, this just [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3692.96s)]
*  came out, White House correspondent named Jennifer Jacobs just reported that the US has agreed to [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3700.0s)]
*  send Bradley armored vehicles, basically our best tanks to Ukraine. Previously, US officials had [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3705.6s)]
*  balked at sending armored vehicles saying heavier weapons would be too difficult for Ukraine to [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3712.72s)]
*  operate and maintain bad allies are moving to provide such weapons. So we keep providing [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3716.64s)]
*  the Ukrainians with more and more sophisticated weapons, more and more support. Like I said, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3721.92s)]
*  this is leading up to a huge Ukrainian counter offensive in the spring. And I really don't know [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3727.2799999999997s)]
*  what's going to happen at that point. I do think that the Russians will escalate. I don't think [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3731.84s)]
*  they can afford to lose this war. They view it as existential. And like I said, I hope cooler heads [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3735.92s)]
*  will prevail. And if the Ukrainians are successful at breaking through, I hope that the Biden [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3741.92s)]
*  administration will shut this down before they try to retake Crimea. Because we've discussed this [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3747.1200000000003s)]
*  before. I think the Russians confronted with a choice between a total defeat that includes losing [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3752.1600000000003s)]
*  Crimea and their naval base Sevastopol and seize the Ukrainian flag flying over their base at [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3759.52s)]
*  Sevastopol. If that's a choice between that, or potentially using a tactical nuke, maybe at the [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3765.28s)]
*  mouth of the Crimean Peninsula as a firewall, I think they could choose the nuke option. So it's a [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3771.44s)]
*  very dangerous situation and very dynamic. There's a lot of possibilities. All right, let's go on to [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3777.44s)]
*  best performing asset of 2023. I'm going with seed stage investing again. I don't think people [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3784.72s)]
*  want to get into these toxic cap tables at the late stage as Chamath pointed out. So I go with [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3790.3199999999997s)]
*  seed stage and you know, enough to series A the people brave enough to place bets, the founders [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3794.24s)]
*  brave enough to start companies. I believe it's the best performing asset class of 2023. Chamath, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3798.16s)]
*  who do you got? I think that there's still a lot of uncertainty in the world and in the markets. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3801.8399999999997s)]
*  And so I'm generally concerned that there's a lot of chop. And so I pick something that's pretty [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3807.52s)]
*  conservative. But I would have a combination of cash and the front end of the yield curve. So [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3815.2s)]
*  t bills all the way up to two year bonds. So you can generate four and a half probably by the end [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3823.8399999999997s)]
*  of this year, 5% pretty safely owning this stuff while you wait for things to become more certain. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3828.64s)]
*  And the way that I think about it is that I would rather miss the first 10 or 15% of a rally [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3837.68s)]
*  once we're really done this stuff, then try to overcorrect and try to pick a bottom, [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3845.68s)]
*  just because I think that you could lose a lot of money. So I think the goal for this year is to [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3851.2s)]
*  stay resilient and in the game. And so owning having a bunch of cash on the sidelines ready to [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3858.64s)]
*  pound it in. Meanwhile, a portion of it collecting 5% is not such a bad thing while you wait for the [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3864.3999999999996s)]
*  bottom. Fantastic. My answer was actually very, very similar, which is if cash garries right, [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3869.2799999999997s)]
*  that race are going to 5.4% in q1. Why wouldn't you just put all your money in short term t bills, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3874.72s)]
*  you earn five, five and a half percent risk free. Yeah, like set it and forget it. Yeah. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3880.3999999999996s)]
*  And that's why capital flows are moving hugely right now from equities into bonds. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3886.16s)]
*  Especially if we're going to recession, which is inherently deflationary. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3892.24s)]
*  What do you got free bird? Forming asset class of 2023. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3896.24s)]
*  One of the things so I think it's inevitable that we continue to have significant infrastructure [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3900.56s)]
*  spending from both the stimulus and security point of view. So, you know, we kind of want to [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3907.68s)]
*  continue to stimulate the economy and support growth. We want to continue to create jobs and [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3912.16s)]
*  support this transition in the risk. If the recession predictions play out true, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3916.96s)]
*  and the job market does loosen, it's very tight right now. There's going to be even more of an [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3921.2s)]
*  impetus to continue to do infrastructure investment. But I think there's also these big economic [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3925.6s)]
*  transitions happening underway right now with pharmaceuticals, with semiconductors, with energy. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3929.84s)]
*  There's a lot that we've talked about where there's a security problem and a redundancy problem. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3938.08s)]
*  And so, you know, there are a couple of ways to kind of play this infrastructure spending [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3943.76s)]
*  thesis in each of those areas. I've kind of highlighted four of them. One is in semiconductor [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3948.1600000000003s)]
*  capital equipment. So K like 10 core applied materials, that range of businesses that provide [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3953.36s)]
*  and sell the equipment into the fabs and the organizations that build [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3958.0s)]
*  semiconductor manufacturing facilities. The second is kind of an oil and gas services. So similar to [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3965.84s)]
*  what Sachs said earlier, Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, that class of businesses I think benefit [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3971.44s)]
*  in this environment. And this is independent of kind of economic condition, certainly, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3976.56s)]
*  because these are big multi-year spending projects. The third is in the equipment to support them. So [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3981.04s)]
*  deer and caterpillar. And then the fourth, I think, is an important one. I'll talk about this in a [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3986.16s)]
*  minute with respect to my biggest kind of anticipated thing for next year, which is in [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3990.08s)]
*  pharmaceutical infrastructure. So Thermo Fisher, and there's some company and others like them, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3995.3599999999997s)]
*  because there's a lot of build out happening to support these big transitions happening in the [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=3999.92s)]
*  modalities that are being used in pharmaceutical drugs and diagnostics. And then I think that [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4003.3599999999997s)]
*  there's also a couple of these businesses that are diversified like Danaher, Honeywell, Thermo Fisher [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4008.8799999999997s)]
*  is a good example that play across multiple of these opportunities. So those are all great [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4013.68s)]
*  businesses to own and you don't need to worry about, you know, they're growing cashflow positive [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4019.12s)]
*  dividend paying companies and you don't need to worry about, you know, am I getting 5% or 5.5% [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4023.44s)]
*  based on the equity price this year. These are long range businesses that are building real value, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4029.04s)]
*  growing their top line and compounding value from within. And then they're acquiring a lot of smaller [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4033.52s)]
*  businesses, very cheap. I'll say, well, that's an important trend I've seen across these companies, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4038.96s)]
*  Danaher, Honeywell, Thermo Fisher, they buy small companies, they pay very little and they [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4042.64s)]
*  immediately get massive return on invested capital like they're in the high teens. So why get 5% on [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4047.12s)]
*  T-bills when you can get high teens ROIC on the management teams running these incredible platforms. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4053.44s)]
*  So that's where I'm most excited for this year. Okay, now let's move on. That was like a mad, [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4059.2799999999997s)]
*  that was like my, my mad, my mad money segment. I've never done the mad money segment before, [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4065.3599999999997s)]
*  but there you guys go. Worst performing asset. I went with energy because not that I think it's [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4069.36s)]
*  not important, but it just feels like everybody rushed into it in 2022. So it feels like it's [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4074.0s)]
*  overheated. And if we are in a recession, people might lower consumption in terms of energy and be [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4078.32s)]
*  looking for cheaper alternatives. So it could be overheated. So I went with energy. Shamath, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4083.76s)]
*  worst performing asset, you got one? I think that if we've learned anything from the last three years, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4088.56s)]
*  you have to separate the valuation of a company and how it performs in the stock market with its [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4094.48s)]
*  value in society. So for example, if you look at zoom, zoom's valuation has cratered, but its value [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4100.56s)]
*  in society has probably continued to go up. It's still a massively relied upon tool. The point is [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4106.72s)]
*  that markets do not give you credit for the value in society. They will give you credit when you are [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4111.84s)]
*  about to over earn, but then they'll pull it all back when they think that you're going to under [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4117.76s)]
*  earn. So in that lens, I think that tech will have a tough year. I think energy will have a really [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4124.160000000001s)]
*  shit year. And probably the biggest asset class that is going to get pressured is going to be [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4131.4400000000005s)]
*  junk debt. And the reason is a bunch of these variable rate loans, when rates are at five and [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4138.400000000001s)]
*  six percent, that all of a sudden are like 11, 12, 13, 14% coupons, a bunch of companies will have [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4144.72s)]
*  trouble meeting their debt obligations and we'll have to restructure the debt or we'll have to file. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4153.12s)]
*  So tech, energy, and junk. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4158.8s)]
*  Zach's push performing asset for 2023. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4160.4s)]
*  Oh, a subcategory of what Jamoth just said. I think office towers in San Francisco are, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4162.72s)]
*  that is some serious toxic debt, 27% vacancy rates and growing as Lisa's role. I think that [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4167.28s)]
*  a lot of these buildings, maybe virtually all of the San Francisco downtown is going to be [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4175.12s)]
*  owned by the bank soon because no one can meet their- [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4179.92s)]
*  Commercial real estate in San Francisco and perhaps- [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4182.24s)]
*  Well, specifically the office towers because no one wants to be in those skyscraper buildings [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4183.84s)]
*  south of market, mired in homelessness. So yeah, I think that a lot of those buildings [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4189.12s)]
*  can be owned by the banks. There's going to be some major fire sales. Remember, this was the hottest [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4194.72s)]
*  commercial real estate market in the country a few years ago and now it's the worst. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4199.2s)]
*  Well, look what happened to B-REIT. What do you think about that crazy thing that happened with [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4204.32s)]
*  the Blackstone REIT? I mean, that's nuts. Explain what happened? [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4208.88s)]
*  Blackstone has a product called B-REIT. It's like a $70 billion exchange traded fund effectively. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4212.72s)]
*  What it is is the ability for individual investors to own access to Blackstone's [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4219.28s)]
*  commercial real estate portfolio. They had such a massive amount of redemptions that they had to [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4224.0s)]
*  close redemptions at the end of Q4. They were worried that the redemptions were going to [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4229.68s)]
*  continue to go up. These are individual investors who basically sees the writing on the wall, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4234.4s)]
*  as David said, and wants their money out. And so they went to the University of California [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4238.719999999999s)]
*  pension system and they essentially got a huge infusion of capital. I think it was about $4 [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4243.92s)]
*  billion where they guaranteed 11.5% interest to these guys for the $4 billion. And they also [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4250.0s)]
*  posted a billion dollars of their own equity in the actual REIT to backstop it. So what does it [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4257.68s)]
*  show you? I think what Sachs is saying is really right. It may not just be in San Francisco, but [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4264.72s)]
*  with all of these people either getting laid off, with all of these people now working remotely, [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4270.0s)]
*  we may finally start to see the beginning of the reckoning in commercial real estate, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4275.200000000001s)]
*  which has been an unbelievably performant asset class up until right about now. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4279.360000000001s)]
*  And on top of that, you have to factor in these much higher rates. And so these building [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4283.68s)]
*  owners, if they financed it, which they invariably have always financed, they have huge variable rate [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4287.44s)]
*  payments that are due on these buildings. The rent rolls are lower. Even people like Twitter, [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4293.839999999999s)]
*  as you're refusing to pay the rent. So you have to take them to court. So it elongates when they [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4298.24s)]
*  have to pay. And so you could miss a bunch of rent payments and all of a sudden the banks could just [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4302.96s)]
*  go crazy and take ownership of these things. Okay. Do you have a worst performing asset class [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4308.719999999999s)]
*  for 2023 prediction? Sultan of science, queen of Kenwah, Dave Friber. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4315.28s)]
*  It's really simple. I've mentioned it before. It's consumer credit. We assume that rising [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4321.04s)]
*  rates and inflation would taper down consumer demand, meaning consumers buying goods and stuff. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4326.08s)]
*  And that certainly hasn't happened. I'm in Vegas right now. I was in the car yesterday and the [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4334.24s)]
*  driver grew up in Vegas. He's like, I've lived my whole life in Vegas. He's like, I've never seen a [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4338.88s)]
*  December like we just had. It was packed the entire month. He's like, normally in Vegas, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4344.96s)]
*  it's dead up until Christmas and then New Year's people come into town, but it's normally dead. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4349.52s)]
*  I've never seen such a busy month. And I think we see this in the numbers. Consumers are still [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4353.52s)]
*  spending like it's 2021. They're still spending like interest rates are zero. As we talked about, [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4357.44s)]
*  consumer credit is skyrocketing while rates are skyrocketing. And so I think we're going to [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4363.44s)]
*  run into a real wall with respect to consumer credit in sometime this year. And you're going [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4368.4s)]
*  to see, as you guys know, it's such a complicated, interwoven market of assets that the way that this [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4374.08s)]
*  can be traded, there's a lot of different ways to trade it. But I think it's going to be, [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4381.04s)]
*  in general, consumers are not going to be able to meet their debt obligations. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4385.2s)]
*  And it's going to be really hard. Could be mortgages, could be credit card debt, [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4388.24s)]
*  defaults are coming. Yeah. The market has priced in a bunch of this stuff. Obviously, [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4392.72s)]
*  companies like a firm and you know, the, what are they called? Buy now, pay later companies, [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4397.5199999999995s)]
*  but credit card companies, mortgages, there's a lot of assets that you can start to kind of pick [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4402.56s)]
*  apart. Where do you think this unravels first? How does it, what gets hit hardest? What's under [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4407.120000000001s)]
*  priced and overpriced? Probably a lot of good pair trading to do as Jamal kind of loves to talk [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4411.360000000001s)]
*  about with respect to which of these are more likely or less likely to be sensitive to this [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4415.4400000000005s)]
*  dynamic. But there's, I think it's going to be a pretty ugly scene. Consumers just have way too [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4419.52s)]
*  much debt relative to their earnings right now. And it's pretty nasty. And they have some confidence [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4424.160000000001s)]
*  that they'll always have a job or some way to pay their four easy payments. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4429.28s)]
*  Dude, it's hard. I'll say it's hard. It's muscle memory is serious. You know, you come out of 2021 [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4432.88s)]
*  when you had, it's not just stimulus checks. It was the low interest rate and easy credit [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4438.5599999999995s)]
*  availability everywhere. And it's just easy to jump into getting new stuff and cool stuff. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4442.8s)]
*  And then when you get used to getting new stuff every week or every month, you kind of stick with [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4446.48s)]
*  it and you're like, I don't want to give it up just yet. I just not just yet, not just yet, [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4450.5599999999995s)]
*  you know? And so it's, it's hard to kind of step back from spending when you have a [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4454.32s)]
*  new type of lifestyle. And I think that's what's going on. I think this is an incredible observation. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4458.08s)]
*  There's a great TikTok of this guy that runs car dealerships and he sent them out [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4462.56s)]
*  on like how much incredible money, like what a significant percentage of people's income [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4466.08s)]
*  they are spending on their monthly car payments. And people buy these cars that are well beyond [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4471.84s)]
*  what should be kind of a reasonable budget. If you were to go to Susie Orman for advice, [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4476.08s)]
*  she would not buy that freaking car. And the stretching is going to, is going to snap this [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4479.92s)]
*  year. Yeah, absolutely. Which brings us to the most anticipated, I love it, great one, [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4484.4s)]
*  most anticipated trend of 2023 related to yours. I went with austerity. I have a friend [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4489.36s)]
*  who sometimes flies private often. And I was talking to him about his Christmas vacation. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4496.639999999999s)]
*  This friend of mine, Chamath, instead of flying private to his vacation, he had to pick up his [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4501.599999999999s)]
*  kids, he had to go back and forth. He was driving his car. That was three hours. That was you. Oh, [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4506.4s)]
*  okay. I didn't want to, I didn't want to decluck you. But I had a friend, Chamath, who would [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4513.2s)]
*  normally fly private to Lake Tahoe. And he's like, no, I can't go out with you. I'm skiing on Friday. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4518.32s)]
*  I got to pick up my kids and then I'm driving back. I said, wait a second, how are you doing that? [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4523.28s)]
*  He's like, I'm driving a car. I said, what? Who's driving the car? He said, I'm driving the car. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4526.4s)]
*  And that's why I say austerity is my anticipated trend of 2023. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4531.5199999999995s)]
*  I agree with you. I actually think this is a really good opportunity to pull back on [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4535.28s)]
*  so much waste. I haven't really looked at my household budget in probably two or three years, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4539.360000000001s)]
*  didn't even bother. Why? And then and then when I looked at it, I was like, wow, this is really [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4544.88s)]
*  inflated to a level that I didn't expect. Yes. But it makes a lot of sense to live in a more [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4549.120000000001s)]
*  heads down, austere way. I don't know. Yeah. I Well, I mean, look at tonight's menu, you went with duck, [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4555.280000000001s)]
*  I guess the olive fed Wagyu, everything's off the menu now. No black truffles. We're having duck. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4563.200000000001s)]
*  We're down to poultry. That's just next week, we're going to have pasta. It's okay. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4567.68s)]
*  Austerity measures for everybody. They call it foul for a reason. Right. Oh, God. Sax, [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4572.0s)]
*  do you buy into austerity where Chamath and I are austerity belt tightening as our trends? Where [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4578.320000000001s)]
*  were you? What's your trend for I think it's a pretty good trend. The trend that I am going [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4582.64s)]
*  to suggest will be to your great disappointment, J Cal, which is Trump's influence in the GOP [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4588.400000000001s)]
*  continues to wane. You're seeing it in real time right now. The headline is Trump's endorsement [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4594.88s)]
*  proves worthless to Kevin McCarthy in the speaker bid. Even the MAGA faithful like Matt Gaetz, [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4600.96s)]
*  like Lauren Boebert, they are ignoring Trump's pleas to get behind my Kevin. And in fact, they're [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4607.92s)]
*  kind of not just defying him, but making fun of him. Matt Gaetz had a repost Trump saying sad [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4614.88s)]
*  exclamation point. And Boebert was saying that Trump needed to get behind her movement. So we [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4621.52s)]
*  have now a level of open defiance to Trump in the GOP. His endorsements are not what they once were. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4627.6s)]
*  And even if somehow Kevin McCarthy pulls us off, I think all that means is that Trump gets blamed [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4635.68s)]
*  for every swampy rhino compromise that McCarthy has to make to keep the government running over [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4642.400000000001s)]
*  the next two years. So it's a lose-lose. Does that mean that populism is on the wane? Do you [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4647.040000000001s)]
*  think? Because it's the electorate that got him elected in the first place. He was not very popular [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4650.8s)]
*  with politicians. He was kind of an outcast when he got elected the first time. And that may be [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4655.04s)]
*  the case now, but he still got elected because the population loved him. People loved him. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4660.320000000001s)]
*  Is that going to happen? Do you think that means that the populism is kind of waning or the interest [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4664.08s)]
*  of the voters is waning on him? Or is it just the political party's alignment? [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4668.320000000001s)]
*  Boebert only won by a few thousand votes. She didn't exactly crush it in Colorado. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4672.96s)]
*  I think a lot of this has to do with Trump's personal standing after the midterms. The [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4677.12s)]
*  candidates that he personally picked that were all in tough races, they all basically lost. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4682.32s)]
*  It was about the distraction he caused by making the 2020 election such a big deal, [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4686.24s)]
*  constantly looking backwards. So I think the Republican Party doesn't like the antics. It's [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4691.2s)]
*  not about the policies, I don't think. I think it's 100% about Trump's electability and about [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4695.92s)]
*  his ability to get things done. And it's not really about the positions per se. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4703.36s)]
*  So I think, Boebert, to answer your question, I think that the future of the GOP will incorporate [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4709.12s)]
*  this populism, but it's going to find a better integration with the established wing of the [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4713.5199999999995s)]
*  Republican Party. And future candidates will have to basically satisfy both of those wings of the [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4718.96s)]
*  party. Sax, was it was a straw that were maybe the two straws that broke the camel's back for [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4724.16s)]
*  Republicans and Trump in that relationship? Was it January 6 and the election denial? [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4729.2s)]
*  Like for Republicans, is it just like, come on, those are the two things? [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4733.92s)]
*  This constant focusing on the 2020 election. First, it cost them the cost of Republicans that [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4737.76s)]
*  Georgia runoff seat with Purdue against Warnock. Purdue won on election night, didn't clear 50%, [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4743.28s)]
*  had to go to the runoff. This was happened the day before January 6. This happened on January 5th [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4749.44s)]
*  of 2021. That was the first race where Trump's antics cost them. Then you had this midterm [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4754.72s)]
*  election where, you know, all the candidates who had to appease Trump by talking about, again, [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4760.4800000000005s)]
*  the last election, instead of looking to the future, they got punished by the voters. I think [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4766.4800000000005s)]
*  Republicans want to win. I mean, they're tired of losing. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4771.92s)]
*  It's that simple. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4774.08s)]
*  It's that simple. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4774.88s)]
*  Yeah. The job of a politician is to win. Freberg, you got an anticipated trend of 2023. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4775.92s)]
*  I am excited about and want to share the point of view that I think cell and gene therapies are [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4780.799999999999s)]
*  becoming more mainstream. So these are pharmaceutical modalities where we use gene editing systems, [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4788.32s)]
*  where you can actually go in and change or add genetic material to cells in your body [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4794.799999999999s)]
*  to resolve things like genetic diseases or change protein deficiencies or introduce new proteins. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4800.5599999999995s)]
*  And then cell therapies where we engineer cells, put them in the body, [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4805.84s)]
*  and those cells go and do things like attack and destroy cancer cells, for example. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4809.04s)]
*  There are currently 27 FDA approved cell and gene therapies on the market. There are over a thousand [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4814.24s)]
*  in clinical trials, many of which are already showing extraordinary efficacy and benefit. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4819.84s)]
*  Today, these therapies cost upwards of a million dollars. So I think there's a massive and talking [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4824.64s)]
*  about the infrastructure investment conversation earlier, because of the number of diseases and [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4829.5199999999995s)]
*  the number of conditions and a number of people that these therapies can treat. I think there's [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4833.36s)]
*  massive infrastructure investment opportunity coming forward this year, but also seeing these [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4837.76s)]
*  come to market, come out of the clinical trials, get FDA approved, we have to ramp up and build [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4841.84s)]
*  up the infrastructure needed because it's not traditional where you make a drug in a factory [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4846.56s)]
*  and send it to people and they get it injected. These are much more complex. They require much [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4850.08s)]
*  more complicated delivery mechanism. You have to have systems to engineer cells and edit them and [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4854.88s)]
*  put them back in your body. Those systems today take days or weeks and cost, as a result, a million [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4859.4400000000005s)]
*  dollar plus per treatment. So I think that the cell and gene therapy opportunity, the JP Morgan [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4864.48s)]
*  healthcare conference starts this week. It's the biggest biotech and healthcare conference in the [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4870.0s)]
*  world. It starts in San Francisco on Monday. This is one of the biggest areas of interest and one [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4874.0s)]
*  that everyone's investing against. But as these come to market, we talked about this last week, [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4879.679999999999s)]
*  genetic diseases, types of cancer that are going to be addressed. And I'm really excited about [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4884.639999999999s)]
*  seeing more of these products come to market and seeing the whole infrastructure and delivery [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4888.639999999999s)]
*  system change. All right. Sorry to interrupt. Trying to keep the trains moving, gene editing, [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4892.64s)]
*  very good choice. All right. We end with this. It's a little bit fun. Most anticipated media [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4896.320000000001s)]
*  for 2023. These are things we like to talk about the media here. Sometimes we talked about [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4901.76s)]
*  White Lotus, season two, amazing season, and maybe what you're looking forward to next year. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4907.04s)]
*  I am really looking forward to in film Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan's movie about [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4914.400000000001s)]
*  the Manhattan Project. That should be extraordinary. I loved, was Dunkirk his as well. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4918.56s)]
*  I love Dunkirk. I like everything he does. And when he, this is him becoming like a history uncle. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4923.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm here for it. I'm here for Nolan becoming our history uncle instead of Batman. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4929.04s)]
*  What was the one after Inception though that was really confusing? The one with Denzel Washington's [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4933.120000000001s)]
*  son with John Washington? Yes. It was, I couldn't finish it. I tried twice. I got to go with third [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4937.76s)]
*  shot on that one. It was, Oh yeah. It was, it was his worst film. It was really difficult. It was [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4944.96s)]

*  follow. Did you guys see his original film, which was incredible memento? Of course. It was fantastic. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4956.8s)]
*  Yeah. Memento was great. It was enough. It was enough. Mine, mine. Yeah. It was mind bending [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4962.08s)]
*  enough that you're like, Oh my God, incredible. And then I think they took it too far tenant. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4966.72s)]
*  I tried to watch it three times. I'm generally pretty good with these sorts of films and love [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4970.56s)]
*  them, but Oh my God, it was impossible to follow. He, he took it too far. Okay. So hopefully he goes [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4974.64s)]

*  be next level. I cannot wait for that. Sax, you're a media junkie. What do you got on your list of [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=4997.52s)]
*  things you're looking forward to? Or should I say what does Tucker's writers, what do they put down [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5001.92s)]
*  for you? Well, Jake, I thought you were gonna pick, I thought that for movie, you're going to pick [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5005.04s)]
*  cocaine bear. I can't wait for cocaine. It does look really amazing. It does look great. The [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5010.4s)]
*  promise of cocaine is extraordinary. A bear is in the woods and a, I guess people who are trafficking [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5016.88s)]
*  in cocaine drop their or crashes and the bear eats the cocaine and then goes on a rampage. It's [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5025.4400000000005s)]
*  just kind of like a genre film like in the crocodile way. By the way, I'm listening to [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5030.24s)]
*  Quentin Tarantino's book, by the way of criticism. Get the audio book. You'll like it Sax. He talks [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5034.48s)]
*  about all the films in the seventies. Very good. Shout out to Quentin. What do you got? What do you [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5039.92s)]
*  got on your short list? History Uncle? Me? Yeah. What do you got? I just gave you one. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5043.44s)]
*  Cocaine bear top of your list. We'll watch it together. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5050.719999999999s)]
*  Oppenheimer was on my list and I think Marvel is doing a good job developing a new villain [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5053.52s)]
*  to rival Thanos with this, with Kang. I don't know what phase they're on now, but [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5060.0s)]
*  Loki season two and then the new Ant-Man movie. And, you know, I thought after Thanos, [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5064.400000000001s)]
*  he wouldn't really be able to top that, but they've come up with a really good concept, I think, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5069.84s)]
*  for the next, you know, 20 Marvel movies. Well, and then it will eventually become Galactus. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5074.240000000001s)]
*  You guys have completely fucked up. You have missed the most obvious slam dunk. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5078.719999999999s)]
*  Here we go. Shade's new album. Go. Dune, part two. Oh, I haven't watched number one yet. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5083.44s)]
*  Wait, what? You know, I, what happened was, my wife wants to watch it. It is so stylistically [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5090.959999999999s)]
*  beautiful. It is a little boring. There's not a lot going on, but it's so well shot. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5098.08s)]
*  Mm-hmm. It's a, it's visually just stunning. I mean, if you need to watch it on a big screen [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5104.64s)]
*  with big speakers and, but part two comes out in November of this year. Absolutely. That's [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5109.44s)]
*  gonna be great. Okay. Freeberg, tell us what documentary on veganism you recommend and you're [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5113.44s)]
*  anticipating for 2023. What vegan documentary or animal abuse documentary? I am excited about the [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5117.76s)]
*  generative AI based media that I think is going to start to kind of rocket this year. We could see, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5125.44s)]
*  for example, the first, you know, AI written symphony, the first kind of AI written published [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5132.0s)]
*  novel. How interesting would that be? Like a full novel published by AI and more maybe short films [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5138.32s)]
*  based on AI driven script. And maybe even what I'm really excited about is these AI based [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5144.48s)]
*  interactive video games or kind of experiences where you, the user kind of get to create and [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5150.4s)]
*  live your own world through some sort of video game type modality. So I think AI driven media. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5155.68s)]
*  All right. There you have it folks. There are speaking of pop culture chaos, I guess [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5161.68s)]
*  Prince Harry has a book coming out. That's called spare. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5166.96s)]
*  That's fair. Like playing bowling. No, but you know, like in the English monarchy, they, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5171.84s)]
*  there's the air and the spare. So he's calling himself, but to me, that's like a weird self [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5179.76s)]
*  description. Yeah. Like that's, that's how you see yourself as just being self-deprecating. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5186.08s)]
*  He didn't pick that. They paid him so much money. I heard they have to sell 1.7 million books to [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5190.16s)]
*  break even. But you know what it reminds me of is when Leonard Nimoy wrote a book, I think he [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5195.28s)]
*  wrote a book called I am Spock. And then he wrote a book called I am not Spock. Nice. He could never [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5201.28s)]
*  get comfortable with the fact that he was just Spock. Yeah. And there's something weird about [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5206.88s)]
*  calling yourself spare. Like, you know, you're clearly not comfortable with. It's like everything. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5212.0s)]
*  Yeah. Everything they taught you, everything I learned at Harvard business school and everything [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5218.08s)]
*  they don't teach at Harvard business school. You can, you can do both books. All right, listen, [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5223.28s)]
*  this has been great. Breaking news as we're talking here, chat, GPT, open AI, doing a tender offer [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5226.32s)]
*  at 29 billion. With no rabbit, you're losing 3 billion a day. Oh my God. Who is buying at 29 billion? [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5232.96s)]
*  It's founders fund or reportedly according to the journal, it's founders fund thrive capital. So [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5241.2s)]
*  founders fund does not generally do super overpriced deals. Yeah. Yeah, I would buy that. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5246.0s)]
*  That's a silly bet. I mean, come on. I mean, dude, are you kidding me? That's it. That could be a [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5251.68s)]
*  $300 billion company. That's a 10x. Right. But that yeah, it's a 10x from here. I wouldn't, [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5255.04s)]
*  I would not totally could be by the way, you guys remember that the, um, origin of open AI, [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5260.64s)]
*  I don't know what the current situation is, but it was a nonprofit where they said investors put [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5266.32s)]
*  money in, but the investors maximum return was a hundred X on the dollar invested. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5271.12s)]
*  It's a nonprofit, but it's a profit up to a hundred X. No, no, that happened afterwards. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5275.44s)]
*  It's when they converted to the original model. Yeah. No, the original model was a pure non profit [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5279.28s)]
*  where there was no cap because there was no concept of equity. Yeah. When they flipped, [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5287.2s)]
*  they capped everybody to a hundred X on the return. So the original money, but not anymore or still, [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5291.44s)]
*  but no, the original money, which was like Elon's money. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5297.2s)]
*  Who else put in money? Yeah. All that money came in as a, as pure nonprofit. So I don't know how [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5300.0s)]
*  it converted, but that's when they, or did it convert to those people who funded it originally [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5307.92s)]
*  get any shares in the for-profit? We could, we could find out. Probably they did. I mean, [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5311.68s)]
*  it would make sense that they will find out. But I mean, wait, if this is a tender offer, [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5315.28s)]
*  you wouldn't buy shares at 20 billion. So again, like the thing that I want to impress upon you is [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5319.2s)]
*  like, there is an enormous amount of work that they do that what their biggest gap to monetizing [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5325.92s)]
*  this will be finding unique content that they learn on that nobody else has access to. And this [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5332.8s)]
*  is why I really think it's important to understand if you have enough compute, these, all of these [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5340.0s)]
*  unsupervised learning models, if you run them on the same training set, will converge to the same [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5345.84s)]
*  answer. So you're just getting there first. So in order to be really defensible, you have to get [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5351.44s)]
*  there in a unique way. And so either you're going to hand tune or you're going to have inputs that [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5357.04s)]
*  are different. So I don't know, I don't know the answer. That's why like they have to answer that [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5362.799999999999s)]
*  question in their fundraising. And I'm sure that they did because these are smart investors, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5368.4s)]
*  but that's the big idea that you have to overcome. And again, you have to think like, [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5371.92s)]
*  you think Google is sitting on their hands? No, or deal with a competitor. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5375.839999999999s)]
*  29 billion, like what fundamentals is that based on? Like, why not 5 billion? Why not 3 billion? [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5380.48s)]
*  I mean, like, why not 10 billion? Like what makes it? Double valuation. That's what it is. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5385.36s)]
*  It's all this on momentum. It's had nothing to do with reality, right? I mean, this would imply at [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5389.84s)]
*  a 30 the public comps of the Google trades at what 25 or 30 EBIT times EBITDA. So this would imply a [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5396.16s)]
*  billion dollars in EBITDA, a billion dollars in EBITDA, three million dollars a day, they're [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5403.44s)]
*  losing $3 million a day on computer reportedly $3 million a day in profit on what product? [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5409.12s)]
*  I don't know. To have a [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5414.96s)]
*  That's not the issue. I think, look, I mean, my point was if these guys open up a set of tools [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5416.48s)]
*  that support all these applications and services to emerge on top of what they've built, [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5421.2s)]
*  and they're getting red share, getting payments out of that, it's going to very quickly turn into a [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5426.64s)]
*  real scalable infrastructure business. Here's the problem, this is why that can't happen. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5429.92s)]
*  They don't have the rights to the data they built the training set on. And the second they [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5433.36s)]
*  commercialize it, the second anybody pays them, whoever they base this on, they're going to get [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5437.44s)]
*  into oblivion, I predict, sued into oblivion. Let's talk about that in the next show, [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5443.5199999999995s)]
*  because I think that's the way that AI works. And we should probably bring someone like Sam [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5449.28s)]
*  on to talk about it. But the way that AI works on training data, and now people are making claims [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5452.639999999999s)]
*  that the training data is copyright, therefore, model output is protected, protects that copyright [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5458.24s)]
*  is, I think, worthy of a good conversation. What's interesting is, you know, [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5464.08s)]
*  the early version of the of the internet was very simple. It's like you had this file called [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5468.24s)]
*  robux.txt. And you would basically be open to a crawl or not. And that's what would allow Google [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5472.16s)]
*  to basically go and spider your pages. Right. And so we have to replace this concept of that with this [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5477.2s)]
*  AI dot txt. Well, you could make a claim that this is no different than, you know, a spider crawling a [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5483.599999999999s)]
*  web page, except that in the in the search case, it was much cleaner, which is we're just going to [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5490.4s)]
*  index your page and redirect people to you. Here, it's we're actually going to create a derivative [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5495.28s)]
*  work because of you and go. And I do think that that's going to be a very interesting legal [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5500.88s)]
*  threshold that has to get figured out. Well, here it is, Chamath, you're nailing it exactly. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5506.0s)]
*  It's a derivative work. And they did not have permission to use it. And it impedes upon the [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5510.16s)]
*  original authors, whether it's a photo, it's a song, it's a piece of code, it impedes upon [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5515.679999999999s)]
*  their ability to do commerce in the world, you are interfering with their ability to monetize [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5521.28s)]
*  their content. And the percentage you're using is 100%. So when you get to fair use, non commercial [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5525.12s)]
*  use is very protected, parities protected, education's protected. But when you dip into [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5530.88s)]
*  using the entirety of the work, which they're doing, and you impede upon the person's ability [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5536.88s)]
*  to do commerce, and you confuse the public, well, this is why I test that they will fail, fail, fail. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5542.5599999999995s)]
*  This is why I think that most people don't understand what AI is, they don't even understand the [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5547.5199999999995s)]
*  difference between training and inference. So hopefully, there is some more understanding [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5551.12s)]
*  of this. But if you use the same data set, you will eventually converge to the same outputs, [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5556.32s)]
*  absent of hand tuning weights, which has its own issues, and absent any asymmetrically different [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5561.44s)]
*  data that you have that nobody else has. Absolutely. Yes. So if you are Apple, and you [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5570.5599999999995s)]
*  have the watch data, or you're Google, and you have the search data, or you're a weather company, [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5575.68s)]
*  you have the weather data, and you're a proprietary, of course, there's a very easy [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5579.68s)]
*  solution to this, Jamath. Number one, citations, when the algorithm gives you an answer, it should [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5582.64s)]
*  say, what were the top percentage sources of this information? How did the AI use other people? [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5588.240000000001s)]
*  Look, if you look inside of a transformer, the problem is, okay, that you're going to have [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5594.88s)]
*  trillions of ranks, trillions of weights, trillions. And so how are you going to decide [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5598.8s)]
*  how to basically draw a line under a threshold, this was actually a useful input, and this was [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5604.320000000001s)]
*  not. So again, I just think that it's hard, a very few small class of people actually understand [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5609.04s)]
*  this, like the great person to actually bring in to talk about this would be Andre Carpathy, not, [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5614.88s)]
*  and I think because Andre was there, sure, and at Tesla, and he but he can say it in a very [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5619.36s)]
*  dispassionate way to explain this to people, I think we should, we should ask him to come on. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5624.64s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. I mean, I can ask him. I mean, this is brand is this the law, [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5628.72s)]
*  Sachs, you're an attorney, you understand fair use copyright, all this stuff. The law, correct me if [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5633.76s)]
*  I'm wrong here, Sachs does not anticipate this. Like this highly specialized area, I don't want [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5638.08s)]
*  to pretend like I understand the law in this area. You know, I'd want to talk to a specialist. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5643.12s)]
*  Yeah, okay. Anybody have this conversation? I think yeah, this is a great, juicy discussion [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5648.16s)]
*  work for us to talk about because this is probably why by the way they started as open source, [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5653.68s)]
*  because it was like a slam dunk thing to make this a nonprofit and open source everything, [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5658.48s)]
*  maybe in part because of these issues. But if you just let the code run free, [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5664.080000000001s)]
*  you probably don't have to even deal with these issues, right? [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5670.72s)]
*  Well, they they closed it, remember their claim, the claim was this is too dangerous. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5674.160000000001s)]
*  Their original claim was it's too dangerous for people to not see the code. Then Sam flipped on [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5678.64s)]
*  that. And he said, it's too dangerous for people to see the code. And it started out as a nonprofit, [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5683.120000000001s)]
*  where the idea was the way to keep this safe is for everybody to see the code. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5687.92s)]
*  But they didn't make any money, whatever private and they flip the decision. So [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5692.879999999999s)]
*  keep that in mind as well. He's a he's a very, very, very clever business person. He's savvy. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5696.719999999999s)]
*  And you know, Paul Graham, when Paul Graham picked Sam to run YC, Paul Graham said that this is the [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5702.48s)]
*  most impressive person I've met since Steve Jobs. Yeah. Remember that? Come on the pot. I do remember [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5708.879999999999s)]
*  that. He said something similar about Gary Tan is now running YC starting this week. Sam Altman, [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5713.759999999999s)]
*  friend of the pot. Come on all in anytime and has played in our poker game several times. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5718.5599999999995s)]
*  Yes, we we had a tough situation there where you interfered in the hand, if you remember. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5722.799999999999s)]
*  All right, listen, this is what happened. What there was a salmon I were in a hand of poker. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5728.24s)]
*  He raised, I had two pair and I'm trying to figure out does he have a set or is he bluffing me? I [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5734.5599999999995s)]
*  think he's got top pair. And you were like, Oh, look at this. And you started commenting on the [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5738.879999999999s)]
*  hand. Oh, my god, I remember the caller now. Yeah. And I'm like, oh my god, I'm like, [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5742.4s)]
*  Chamath, for my la bouche. Let's, let's stop talking here. Because I'm trying to [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5746.24s)]
*  unplay. And I'm like, okay, Sam would get an I basically came to the conclusion, Sam would get [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5751.84s)]
*  delight. Great delight bluffing me off a hand. He's a risk taker. He knows I'm conservative. He [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5755.12s)]
*  knows he's a risk taker. I'm going to call here with my I had bottom two. I'm like, does he have [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5759.28s)]
*  a set? And there was also a strain on the board. I'm like, fuck it. I at best I'm, you know, even [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5764.16s)]
*  money here. But there was a lot in the pot. So I was just doing the pot odds. While I'm doing the [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5770.719999999999s)]
*  pot odds, you were like, which is usually me. I'm usually the one being reprimanded for talking [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5773.84s)]
*  about the head. But it was notable. I listen. Love you besties. Why don't you tell people that [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5780.64s)]
*  there's no comments. And just as a programming note, we turned off comments for a couple of weeks on [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5784.96s)]
*  the YouTube just to see how it psychologically affects me and for Chamath to just f with all [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5789.76s)]
*  you Brigadunas. We love you. Besties. This has been a great episode. Two great and his Twitter [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5794.64s)]
*  is at Chamath and he doesn't read it. Just so everyone knows, Sax and I voted against turning [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5803.28s)]
*  off comments. Just just voted in favor of whatever got high Chamath's vote for the All In Summit 23. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5807.92s)]
*  So that's how I vote. This is horse trading now. But the podcast has never been better. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5814.16s)]
*  Besties spending time together on the slopes is the cure to all evils. We'll see you next time. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5819.5199999999995s)]
*  Love you besties. Bye bye. Love you guys. Bye bye. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UjMit3xGY&t=5824.4s)]
