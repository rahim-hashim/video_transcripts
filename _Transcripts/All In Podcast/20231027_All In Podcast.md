**All In Podcast:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ)
*  What are the next steps in your interview process for your cabinet position? Secretary of Treasury, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Chamath. Secretary of State, Sachs, J. Cal. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5.68s)]
*  Press secretary, obviously. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=10.0s)]
*  Press secretary. Oh my God, press secretary. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=11.84s)]
*  Can you imagine me in the press briefing room? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=14.48s)]
*  Whoever wins the presidency, I just want you guys to know, I would be a great secretary of sweaters. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=17.44s)]
*  I will source incredible- [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=22.64s)]
*  Only cashmere. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  I will redesign the outfits of the entire military industrial complex. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=26.16s)]
*  In Loro Piana, yes. The Navy SEALs will be in Loro Piana from head to toe. It's a new outfit for them. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  They're going to go whack Osama Demedne next time with Loro Piana $4,500 French shoes. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=37.04s)]
*  Can you imagine SEAL Team Six wearing the Cunha? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  Absolutely, it's going to be great. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=45.52s)]
*  It's going to be chilling in those Apaches and the Blackhawks. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=46.8s)]
*  You're going to want like a Pashmina wrap or something. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=50.56s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=53.12s)]
*  Pashmina wrap. Have you been to Afghanistan at night? It's crazy. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=53.76s)]
*  All right, everybody. Welcome to episode 151 of the All In Podcast with me again today, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=57.68s)]
*  the Sultan of Science, the Queen of Kinwa, the Prince of Panic Attacks, David Friedberg, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=83.92s)]
*  the dictator himself, Chamath-Pali-Hapitiya, and your crazy angry history uncle, David Saxe is here. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=89.44s)]
*  Welcome to the program, everybody. We've got a very full docket. I guess we'll start it off with [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=96.8s)]
*  how the war and the conflict in the Middle East is going here. Saxe, you hosted a Twitter space [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=102.88s)]
*  with Vivek and Elon on preventing World War III. What was the premise and the reason [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=109.28s)]
*  for setting up this trio to talk about World War III? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, I think Vivek actually had the idea to do it. We had a couple other folks on the panel as [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=124.08s)]
*  well. We had Colonel Daniel Davis, who has a podcast called Deep Dive. He's a military expert. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=128.88s)]
*  We had Alexander Mercuris from the Duran, which is a top geopolitics podcast. We were talking [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=133.84s)]
*  about the risk of a series of chain reactions that could happen in the next few weeks here [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=140.0s)]
*  over what's happening in the Middle East. Elon wanted to do it because of what he said, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=146.16s)]
*  which is that he's talking to a lot of world leaders. He's talking to a lot of different [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=151.52s)]
*  people. They tell him that the risk of some major war happening or some greater catastrophe is higher [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=155.04s)]
*  than they've ever seen. He was quite concerned about that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=163.36s)]
*  I think a few things came out of it. The first is, and I think Elon took this position most [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=169.12s)]
*  strongly, we really need to end the war in Ukraine. The combination of having a war in Ukraine [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  that involves the United States and then a war in the Middle East that could also involve the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=180.56s)]
*  United States and Russia has troops in Syria, there's a lot of ways for this to spiral out [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=184.72000000000003s)]
*  of control. There's a lot of room for unintended consequences. His view was, look, we've just had [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=190.32s)]
*  five months of counteroffensive here. It didn't go anywhere. On net, the Ukrainians didn't take [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=196.72s)]
*  back any territory. In fact, the Russians slightly gained territory. This war is going nowhere. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  It has failed. It is time for the administration to work towards a ceasefire and a resolution. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=208.16s)]
*  Failed for who? Well, the Ukrainians have not taken back. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=214.24s)]
*  What do you say, Tom? They had a completely failed [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  counteroffensive. Okay. But you said the war has failed. I'm just curious which side. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=219.76s)]
*  Sorry, the counteroffensive has failed. Okay, got it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=223.76s)]
*  We're now, the counteroffensive started on June 4th or 5th. It's now October 26th. If you look [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=227.12s)]
*  at the map that the New York Times provided, Ukraine has not taken back any meaningful amount [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  of territory. In fact, Russia on net has gained territory even when it was supposed to be Ukraine [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=237.6s)]
*  on offense. So there is no prospect of Ukraine achieving its objective of evicting Russia from [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=243.76s)]
*  their territory. So what is the point of this war? They have defended themselves from an invasion [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=251.04s)]
*  from Putin. Yeah, you would say that. They've ended up, what's successful about it? Several [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=255.84s)]
*  hundred thousand Ukrainians have died. Well, they successfully didn't get taken over as a country [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=262.48s)]
*  when they were invaded by the Russians. That was Russia's goal. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  Okay. So when they sent the troops in there, their goal wasn't to invade? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=269.36s)]
*  What was their goal then? Honestly, you don't really understand the history of the conflict. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=273.76s)]
*  No, no. I mean, we've talked about history. I'm just saying the way you're framing it is that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=279.36s)]
*  Ukraine failed. It seems to me they've also, the argument could be that they defended themselves [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=282.88s)]
*  successfully. If you look at what's happened this year, so let's just put a pin in what happened [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=286.56s)]
*  last year because I think there's different ways of interpreting it. But if you look at what's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=292.32s)]
*  happened this year, and certainly over the last five months, Ukraine has made no progress in [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=295.28s)]
*  evicting the Russians, nor is there any prospect of them evicting the Russians. So the continuation [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=300.4s)]
*  of that war doesn't achieve anything except kill the flower of Ukrainian youth and continue to- [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=305.76s)]
*  And Russian youth. The Ukrainians are dying in much higher numbers. And Russia is a much bigger [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  country. They've got something like five times the population. So moreover, with this new conflict in [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  the Middle East, you create all these unintended consequences and all this risk of escalation [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=322.4s)]
*  being in a proxy war with Russia. So that was the first thing to come out of the Twitter space was [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=327.04s)]
*  a consensus among the people who were there that it's time to resolve this conflict with Russia. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=333.44s)]
*  The United States does not need to be in a proxy war with Russia. We need to normalize relations. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  It's way too dangerous to be continuing this with what's going on in the Middle East. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=342.64000000000004s)]
*  The second half of the Twitter space, I think, was about the scenarios here for what could come [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=348.24s)]
*  in the Middle East. And just briefly, I think that there's three scenarios here for what could [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=354.88s)]
*  happen, assuming Israel goes into Gaza. This is what everyone's waiting for is, will there be a [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=360.64s)]
*  ground invasion of Gaza? Netanyahu says they're going to do it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=365.52s)]
*  The theory on why they haven't right now is the US is actually moving a bunch of assets, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=369.2s)]
*  military assets into place. They're putting air defense batteries around military bases in the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=373.68s)]
*  Middle East. So there's been a lot of reporting that the US has told Israel to wait until the US [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=378.48s)]
*  military is ready for any blowback that could happen. But Netanyahu has been very clear that [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=383.44s)]
*  they are going in no matter what anybody else says. Three scenarios could arise from that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=387.68s)]
*  Number one is what Israel and I think the administration want, which is that they have [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=392.32s)]
*  a successful military operation and the US's threats deter Hezbollah or Iran from getting in. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=398.48s)]
*  So that would be scenario number one. Scenario number two would be that the Israelis go in, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=405.04s)]
*  it's guerrilla fighting, it's much tougher than anybody expects, they start to take casualties. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=411.28s)]
*  At the same time, you get massive public uproar. You get a lot of protests, the Arab street erupts, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=415.52s)]
*  more and more leaders across the world denounce Israel. And so you kind of muddle your way [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=421.52s)]
*  eventually towards a ceasefire in a couple of months. So that would be scenario number two. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=426.79999999999995s)]
*  Scenario number three is that this thing spirals out of control very quickly where you get Hezbollah [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=431.35999999999996s)]
*  in the north, invade, so you have a second front. The West Bank could erupt in protests, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=436.32s)]
*  that could potentially create a third front. Iran could get involved either because they feel the [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=441.76s)]
*  need to defend Hezbollah or because you have people like Lindsey Graham who are basically [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  already calling for war with Iran. So either side could basically escalate into that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=450.96s)]
*  So I think there's- [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=455.84s)]
*  Explain what happened with Lindsey Graham because he was telling them if Iran, if they got involved, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  that we would strike back, yeah? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=462.64s)]
*  Yeah, but I think that- [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=464.24s)]
*  He wasn't saying invade Iran. That was not his- [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=465.12s)]
*  I think he's saying pretty clearly that if Hezbollah gets involved, we're blaming Iran for that. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=467.76s)]
*  Got it. Okay. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=472.08s)]
*  So he's chomping at the bit to basically invade Iran. Now, how could that happen? Well- [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=472.72s)]
*  You're saying you think he's chomping at the bit to invade Iran? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=478.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah, sure. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=481.12s)]
*  So he gave them the warning to not- [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=481.92s)]
*  This has been on the Neocon agenda. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  So I'm curious about that point. Yeah, explain that piece. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=484.8s)]
*  This has been on the Neocon agenda for a long time. They've wanted to have a war with Iran. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=488.0s)]
*  They basically see the Iranian regime as an enemy and they want to knock it off. Even if you go back [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=491.6s)]
*  to 2003, the beginning of the Iraq war, there was serious conversation about whether Iraq was the [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=496.48s)]
*  right country to invade. A lot of people thought that we should go after Iran, not Iraq. The Bush [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=502.8s)]
*  administration's view on that was, don't worry, we're going to get them all. The question is, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=509.68s)]
*  which one to do first? We're going to knock off Saddam first. In fact, what's going to happen is [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=514.24s)]
*  we're going to be greeted as liberators. The invasion is going to be so successful [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=518.16s)]
*  that the rest of these tyrannical Middle Eastern regimes are just going to throw up their arms [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=521.8399999999999s)]
*  and they're going to basically surrender and become democracies. This was the Bush administration's [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=526.7199999999999s)]
*  claim back in 2003. Obviously, it didn't work out like that. But there has been a desire to go into [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=532.0s)]
*  a lot of these countries for a long time. I think there are a lot of these Neocons who see [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=537.4399999999999s)]
*  Iran as unfinished business. If they get the chance to do that, they will. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=542.72s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell So yeah, that's the piece of your [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=548.24s)]
*  analysis there that I thought was most interesting. You think Lindsey Graham wants to invade Iran. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=552.16s)]
*  When he gave that warning in his speech, which I think came out today or did come out yesterday, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=556.56s)]
*  you think when he gave him the warning, hey, don't get involved or that's going to be the [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=562.0s)]
*  third front, you actually think he wants to invade? The United States has that agenda. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=565.2s)]
*  I think there's a lot of Neocons who have that agenda. And you see this in the Wall Street [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=570.16s)]
*  Journal, which is sort of the leading Neocon publication. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=574.7199999999999s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Got it. Okay, so let's explain what the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=577.52s)]
*  Wall Street Journal obviously has been talking about Hamas militants being trained in Iran a [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=580.0799999999999s)]
*  few weeks before the 10-7 attacks. And it says about 500 militants from Hamas. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=587.68s)]
*  Pete Slauson Even when 10-7 happened, remember there was that Wall Street Journal story claiming [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=591.92s)]
*  that Iran had directed the whole thing. And then that was knocked down by Israeli officials [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=596.16s)]
*  who said, we haven't seen evidence of that, as well as Washington officials, you know, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=603.28s)]
*  kind of the usual unnamed knock that down. So, the Wall Street Journal has been kind of pushing [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=608.24s)]
*  the edge here trying to, I'd say, rattle the saber and gin up some sort of action against Iran. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=614.16s)]
*  The latest thing was a story claiming that 500 militants had just been trained by Iran. So, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=620.72s)]
*  they keep trying to put this idea in play that we need a war against Iran, is my point. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=626.72s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Okay, so just let me reflect that back to you. You're saying [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=632.48s)]
*  Lindsey Graham wants to invade Iran, and he's part of the Neocon agenda. And the Wall Street Journal [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=634.96s)]
*  is not just straight reporting this. The Wall Street Journal is in trying to incite an [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=640.96s)]
*  incident here and start a war with Iran. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=646.0s)]
*  Well, the Wall Street Journal reflects the agenda of the people who own it, and then the people who [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=648.0799999999999s)]
*  are their sources. And clearly, somebody is leaking these stories to the journal. Somebody [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=654.7199999999999s)]
*  leaked the idea on day one of this crisis that Iran was secretly directing the whole thing, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=661.3599999999999s)]
*  even though Israel itself said that was not true. So, yeah, look, they have an agenda. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=666.56s)]
*  They have an agenda. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=671.12s)]
*  So, the Wall Street Journal's agenda is to saber-rattle and incite a global war with Iran. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=672.0s)]
*  Or are you saying that they're just useful idiots and that they're being manipulated by the [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=679.28s)]
*  military global complex and the Neocons? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=683.68s)]
*  I'm just saying that the Wall Street Journal's saber rattling. So, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=686.56s)]
*  that's as if the Wall Street Journal wants to start a conflict. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=689.92s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal is beating the drums of war. That's what's going on. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=692.56s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Okay, so you believe the journalists at the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=695.8399999999999s)]
*  Wall Street Journal are trying to start a war with Iran? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=698.96s)]
*  Shemaf Frebreg They are beating the drums of war. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=701.12s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell That's what beating the drums of war means to you. Okay. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=703.36s)]
*  Shemaf Frebreg, you think that the Wall Street Journal here is trying to start a war with Iran? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=706.8000000000001s)]
*  Shemaf Frebreg I'll give you a little bit of history here. I'm going to presume you know it, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=710.48s)]
*  so it'll be repetitive. But it used to be that Iran was a bastion of economic growth and cultural [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=713.44s)]
*  vitality, right? But if you go even further back, there was a duly elected prime minister that was [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=719.52s)]
*  overthrown, Mohammed Mossadeh, because he tried to nationalize the oil industry in the 50s in Iran. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=724.32s)]
*  And that coup d'etat, which was run by the army, was sponsored by the UK and US government. So, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=730.96s)]
*  we've had a long kind of sorted history with Iran for a very long time, post-World War II. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=738.8000000000001s)]
*  A lot of it has been intertwined with petrodollars and oil. So, you know, we had the Shah [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=746.32s)]
*  then there was this duly elected prime minister. He tried to nationalize the oil industry. He was [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=754.4000000000001s)]
*  overthrown in a coup d'etat supported by America and Britain. They brought back the foreign oil [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=760.24s)]
*  companies, including American oil companies. Then the Shah ran for 30 years, but then he was [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=766.8000000000001s)]
*  overthrown for a whole bunch of cultural issues. And so, it's gone back and forth and back and [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=772.96s)]
*  forth. So, I think it's important to keep in mind that a lot of that generation, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=777.36s)]
*  it's not clear to me where their views come from. And what I mean by that generation is folks of [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=783.76s)]
*  Lindsey Graham's generation and older have this multi-layered view of Iran because they've seen [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=788.5600000000001s)]
*  two or three of these regime changes and they've seen the changing incentives that America has had [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=794.08s)]
*  towards dealing with them. So, instead of just kind of putting it out there like we just want [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=798.8000000000001s)]
*  to go to war, I think it's important to remember that these guys have a historical context that [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=803.52s)]
*  younger folks may not. Okay, that's number one. Number two, I think it's David is right [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=808.64s)]
*  that there are certain publications that are beating the drums of war. The first time that [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=815.76s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal did it, it was that Iran was the one that essentially was the trigger [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=820.4s)]
*  puller on the October 7th attacks. And that was immediately refuted, interestingly, not by Iran, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=827.36s)]
*  which did it later, but actually by the United States and Israel. So, I do think that there [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=836.08s)]
*  is some questionable incentives that drove the publication of that article at a very critical [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=842.5600000000001s)]
*  point at the beginning of this Israel, Hamas, Gaza war. An idea of what that incentive would be. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=849.44s)]
*  No, I don't know, except to say that the facts are that there was an article that pointed the finger. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=857.36s)]
*  It was written as an exclusive. It was written in a moment where things were very heightened [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=865.36s)]
*  and little was known. And that these governments had to come out and explicitly disavow and [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=869.92s)]
*  deescalate it. And so, I think that's just an important thing to observe. Now, we're in this [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=876.08s)]
*  second wave where there's a second attempt to now point the finger directly back to Iran as having [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=880.8000000000001s)]
*  trained these Hamas terrorists as now engaging in, and it's not to say that they're not, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=886.08s)]
*  but it's just that this escalation is definitely happening on a continuous basis. And so, it's [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=891.6s)]
*  important to, frankly, understand the historical context and deescalate so that we don't, I think [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=896.1600000000001s)]
*  Elon is right. This is how you sleepwalk into war, is you read a headline, you believe it, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=902.0s)]
*  and then you run with it. And the opposite of sleepwalking is underwriting from first [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=908.8000000000001s)]
*  principles. I think it's important to go and read the historical context of how we've been engaged [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=914.1600000000001s)]
*  in Iran since World War II particularly, the back and forth, the complicated issue of all [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=920.24s)]
*  the petrodollars. And then you can view Lindsey Graham's comments in two veins, I think. Vein [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=926.48s)]
*  number one is he was there with a bipartisan delegation of, I think it was 10 US senators, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=934.5600000000001s)]
*  five Republicans, five Democrats. So I think it's fair to say that he is not just speaking off the [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=942.08s)]
*  top of his head. I think that there's some understanding of what he intended to say. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=948.4s)]
*  And so, I do think that this is sort of a backchannel way of getting on the record that [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=952.4s)]
*  they really need to deescalate. If they are given an opportunity to engage, they should not. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=956.72s)]
*  I think that's the escalated message. And when you say they, you're talking about Iran. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=962.16s)]
*  Yeah. Iran should deescalate. And frankly, hopefully they listen and they do it. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=965.44s)]
*  Lindsey Graham's quote, just to put it out there when he was visiting Tel Aviv, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=970.08s)]
*  we are here today to tell Iran, we're watching you. If this war grows, it's coming to your backyard. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=974.1600000000001s)]
*  The idea that this happened without Iranian involvement is laughable. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=979.36s)]
*  Freberg, what are your thoughts? Do you think the journalists at [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=982.88s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal are complicit in trying to incite something here? Do you think they're [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=986.8000000000001s)]
*  just reporting the facts straight? What's your take on this? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=993.0400000000001s)]
*  Can I answer that? Because I actually have a data point. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=996.32s)]
*  Yeah. No. I mean, and the reason I'm pushing you on it, Sax, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=998.48s)]
*  you're using the language of conspiracy, like complicit, to make it sound like I'm leveling [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1001.2800000000001s)]
*  an accusation at them when what I'm saying is this is their editorial policy. And you can see that [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1006.72s)]
*  by actually reading their editorial. So therefore, look at an op-ed that came from [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1012.08s)]
*  their editorial board two days ago called Biden's Red Line Moment with Iran. And what it says is [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1016.8000000000001s)]
*  that the U.S. would respond swiftly and decisively to any attack on American forces from Iran or its [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1022.8000000000001s)]
*  proxies. And then it says, that's a welcome message aimed at deterring the mullahs in Tehran [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1027.2s)]
*  and their agents. But will the president enforce the red line that he appears to be drawing? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1031.3600000000001s)]
*  He hasn't so far. So in other words, the journal editorial board is saying that Biden has not been [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1035.52s)]
*  tough enough on Iran. Okay. Now go to the last paragraph. It also says, the president's [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1042.0s)]
*  editorial board is saying that Biden has not been tough enough on Iran. Okay. Now go to the last [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1047.04s)]
*  paragraph. It also says here, Iran is using its proxies to test U.S. resolve. The more they attack [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1051.84s)]
*  without Iran paying a price, the more likely that Iran will raise the stakes. The paradox Mr. Biden [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1057.76s)]
*  has to appreciate, the most stabilizing move for the region will be restoring America as a deterrent [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1063.92s)]
*  power. So what does that mean? You take these things together, they're saying that in order to [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1069.68s)]
*  stabilize the region, we need to deter Iran. But they say that just making threats of deterrence [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1074.48s)]
*  is not enough. You actually have to do something. So in other words, like attacking Iran is the [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1079.92s)]
*  stabilizing move, which is war is peace. It's right out of George Orwell. So this is what I mean, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1084.88s)]
*  beating the drums. And by the way, the reason I'm not saying you're conspiracy theorists, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1090.64s)]
*  there is editorials, then there's news, and then there's your imprecise language that I'm just [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1094.72s)]
*  challenging you on because I want you to be precise here. If you're saying the journalists are [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1100.16s)]
*  trying to provoke a war here or, you know, in the banging the drum and saber rattling, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1105.0400000000002s)]
*  sounds like they're trying to- Well, saber rattling and banging the drums are a bit imprecise. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1110.16s)]
*  You're going down a weird rabbit hole of what the Wall Street Journal believes. I think it's pretty [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1114.5600000000002s)]
*  clear that their editorial policy is they are super hawkish on Iran. They don't think Biden's [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1119.3600000000001s)]
*  been tough enough on Iran. They also have published two stories that have been either knocked down or [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1124.56s)]
*  questioned since October 7th that clearly want to lay all the blame for this on Iran. And so they [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1130.56s)]
*  are ginning up both in their news and their editorial pages. They're beating the drums of war. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1137.12s)]
*  They're trying to basically prime the administration to go to war. Got it. They're trying to goad the [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1141.44s)]
*  administration. But I don't think- I don't understand why. Honestly, I feel like we're going [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1148.6399999999999s)]
*  down a rabbit hole. Look- No, I'm just trying to understand your position. And if you're talking [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1153.52s)]
*  about the editorial page, you're talking about the reporting, that's all. I'm just trying to get you [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1157.84s)]
*  to be more precise. That's all. I think both in this case. Remember, if you go back to the reporting [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1161.6s)]
*  on the Ukraine war, and I followed a lot of it by all the major publications, in my opinion, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1166.8s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal's news coverage of Ukraine was some of the most biased and inaccurate of any [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1172.72s)]
*  publication, any major Western publication. And I'll just give you one example here, which is on [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1179.28s)]
*  August 31st, the Wall Street Journal claimed that Ukraine had a major success in its counteroffensive, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1185.36s)]
*  claiming that it had pierced the main Russian defensive line. We are now, what is it, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1192.6399999999999s)]
*  basically two months since then. And it's very clear that that did not happen. That was all [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1199.84s)]
*  nonsense. And again, read the first paragraphs here. Not only did they claim to penetrate the [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1206.24s)]
*  main Russian defensive line, it said it raised hopes of a breakthrough that would reinvigorate [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1211.04s)]
*  the slow-moving counteroffensive. Was there a subsequent breakthrough? Did hopes get raised? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1215.52s)]
*  No, this was total nonsense. So your position here is the journalists who wrote this story [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1220.56s)]
*  are in some way trying to benefit the neocons in the military industrial complex. I just want [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1226.32s)]
*  to be clear about it because using the Wall Street Journal as an active participant in this [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1234.4s)]
*  as a reporter, it's just kind of an explosive, it's not kind of, it is, it's an explosive claim. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1239.8400000000001s)]
*  And so I'm just trying to be clear. Not really. I'm just saying that their reporting [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1244.4s)]
*  on Ukraine was highly inaccurate and it was all inaccurate in the same way, which is it always [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1249.2s)]
*  overstated the Ukrainian successes in this war. So I call that bias. I think it's easy to prove. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1255.76s)]
*  I think they have a similar bias, which is stated explicitly by their editorial board, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1262.64s)]
*  which is they don't think that Biden and DC has been hawkish enough on Iran and they would like [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1266.96s)]
*  to see, they think the stabilizing move is for Biden to basically take action against Iran, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1273.68s)]
*  whatever that means. Yeah. Okay. Freeberg, any thoughts on this before we move on to the next [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1280.72s)]
*  topic? Nothing on the war on the situation. No, I'm good. We can pivot off of that. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1287.44s)]
*  No, I want to hear what Freeberg has to say. Yeah. That's why I'm bringing him in. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1295.2s)]
*  I feel like we're debating the wrong thing, which is you're actually questioning whether there are [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1299.1200000000001s)]
*  war drums beating for Iran when I think it's abundantly clear what we should be discussing [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1304.64s)]
*  is whether that's a wise move for the US. I think it's clear that these drums are being beaten. I [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1310.8s)]
*  think the question is why would we allow that to be the default plan of action? My concern, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1316.32s)]
*  everyone's going to think it's crazy, but it's that there's a very, very low probability, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1325.9199999999998s)]
*  but now probably much higher than it was that the world marches towards using a nuclear weapon for [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1332.96s)]
*  the first time in a long time. And the reason is, as Sax has pointed out so many times, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1340.48s)]
*  there's significant material and industrial production shortages, not just in the US, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1345.68s)]
*  but around the world to support rising conventional wars that seem to be scaling all over. And there's [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1350.0s)]
*  going to be multiple fronts. And to feed those wars with conventional weaponry, there's a breaking [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1357.44s)]
*  point. Our cost of weaponry is 10x, Russia's cost of weaponry, supposedly. I'm just quoting Sax on [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1364.56s)]
*  this point. But if all that is true, at some point, these conflicts become really difficult [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1369.84s)]
*  to maintain. And if we're in the midst of a conflict, you may not be able to simply retreat [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1379.12s)]
*  or recede. At some point, the question is, well, how do we gain superiority again? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1384.3999999999999s)]
*  And whether that's us or Russia backed into a corner, or Israel backed into a corner who [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1391.84s)]
*  also has a nuclear arsenal, there's a couple of scenarios. There's like a million scenarios [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1397.12s)]
*  from here. There's a million realities we could live in from here from today. But there's some [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1401.9199999999998s)]
*  number of them that end up with someone saying, I got to press the button. And remember, not all [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1406.4799999999998s)]
*  nuclear weapons are these things that wipe out a million people instantly. Some of them are small, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1412.8799999999999s)]
*  low tactical weapons that is still very low probability, but much higher than it was a few [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1419.1999999999998s)]
*  weeks ago, that we find ourselves walking because of the fact that we're going to have multiple [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1423.84s)]
*  conflicts and burn through all this conventional weaponry, not have industrial production systems [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1429.12s)]
*  to support all these conflicts. But there's a bunch of countries that have a trump card. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1433.6s)]
*  And once you start talking about it, it'll seem scary at first, then it'll get normalized. And [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1437.9199999999998s)]
*  then it'll become a question of when and where and how. And then all of a sudden, it's like, holy [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1442.8799999999999s)]
*  shit, this is a different world we're living in. That's a scary place I don't want to be in. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1447.36s)]
*  Anything we can do to eliminate those paths from being walked, I'm in favor of even if that means [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1451.04s)]
*  seeding strategic advantages today. I just don't think that that's a place we want to go. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1457.28s)]
*  There's like nine nuclear powers. Who do you think is going to be the one who would [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1462.24s)]
*  actually use a nuclear bomb for your book? Do you have some speculation there? Or you just think [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1468.8s)]
*  everybody runs out of bullets and tanks and missiles, and then they go to nuclear because [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1473.52s)]
*  they have nothing left? I don't know. Look, I tend to think in terms of like, there are multiple [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1476.88s)]
*  parallel scenarios that can play out. So I don't have a point if you're not going to say deterministically, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1481.92s)]
*  I think this thing is going to happen. Again, I think this is very low probability. Sure, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1485.8400000000001s)]
*  I could see a bunch of scenarios emerging. Like, let's say that Russia has got their back against [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1489.2800000000002s)]
*  the wall and Putin's feeling lost and desperate and he needs to use a tactical weapon to, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1493.5200000000002s)]
*  you know, get some regional victory. Again, these tactical nuclear weapons, they're not [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1500.24s)]
*  necessarily the kinds of things that you would use to level Manhattan. Those exist, but there are [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1507.1200000000001s)]
*  other weapons in the arsenal that I get worried that someone says, we're backed in a corner, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1514.24s)]
*  we have nowhere else to go, we can't win this thing conventionally, and we cannot lose. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1519.8400000000001s)]
*  And that's the moment when someone says, this is the, let's start talking about this. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1524.8000000000002s)]
*  And that conversation happens before it gets used, then that conversation becomes normalized, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1528.8000000000002s)]
*  and then suddenly it's not this thing. We all grew up in a world where this was never a real [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1533.6s)]
*  threat or risk or conversation. There was the Cold War and the dismantling, and we were kind [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1537.9199999999998s)]
*  of headed in a good direction for the last 40 some odd years. But now it's like, I don't see [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1541.9199999999998s)]
*  it going in that good direction anymore. So I'm just really nervous about that. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1546.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think you should be nervous about that. Let me give you a couple of examples. So first [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1549.52s)]
*  of all, I agree with Friedberg's point that humans who are convinced of the righteousness of their [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1553.04s)]
*  cause have a tremendous ability to wave away or justify any sort of tactical implications. So, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1556.8s)]
*  for example, we did use two atomic bombs to end World War II. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1565.28s)]
*  That wasn't the only time it was advocated. If you go back to, I think it was around 1950, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1569.9199999999998s)]
*  MacArthur wanted to win the Korean War by using 20 to 30 atomic bombs. And his plan was to so [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1574.3999999999999s)]
*  thoroughly irradiate the border between China and North Korea that China would never be able to [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1583.12s)]
*  invade through an invading army for something like 50 years. Truman had to fire him because [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1589.6799999999998s)]
*  Truman didn't agree with the strategy. And by the way, MacArthur was not some crazy, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1595.04s)]
*  he was not some like wacko. He was the most respected man in America in 1950. And Truman [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1600.56s)]
*  paid a huge political price for having to fire him. It was one of the reasons why Truman couldn't [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1606.7199999999998s)]
*  run for reelection again. So this idea that like rational people would never use these things, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1610.72s)]
*  not true. The generals in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis were all ready to take the nukes [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1615.6000000000001s)]
*  off the chain if the Soviets were willing to break the naval blockades. So, you know, it's not just [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1621.68s)]
*  foreign powers who have rallied the saber on nukes. We've done it at various points through our [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1628.8s)]
*  history too. Let me give you a more mundane example. Just earlier this year, Biden said that we were [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1634.0s)]
*  out of 155 millimeter artillery ammunition. And so we had to give Ukraine cluster bombs. Remember [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1640.56s)]
*  this? Just a year before, that same administration had said the use of cluster bombs was a war crime. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1649.04s)]
*  So in other words, they were able to change their morality on the use of cluster bombs because [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1655.12s)]
*  tactically, they were out of the type of ammunition they want to use, they had nothing left. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1659.6s)]
*  So, you know, I think this kind of reinforces Friedberg's point. Now, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1665.7600000000002s)]
*  look at our inventory replacement times for key systems. This is a report by CSIS, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1669.7600000000002s)]
*  that is a military think tank in Washington. What they show is that our industrial capacity [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1676.64s)]
*  is so hollowed out that it's going to take us five plus years to replace our stockpiles of [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1681.5200000000002s)]
*  artillery ammunition, of javelins, of stingers, of gimlers, as another type of rocket system. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1688.72s)]
*  And so we are like dangerously low on key types of ammunition. And yet, remember when 60 Minutes did [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1696.64s)]
*  that interview with Biden, they said to him, well, gee, if we're in a war both on behalf of Ukraine [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1704.4s)]
*  and on behalf of Israel, doesn't that pose any tradeoffs? And Biden's response was no, we're the [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1710.96s)]
*  most powerful nation in the world. For good measure, he said, we're the most powerful nation [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1715.44s)]
*  in the history of the world. So he doesn't see any tradeoffs. He doesn't see any limits [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1720.16s)]
*  on American power. Quite frankly, I think this is why he's dangerous is because he still thinks [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1724.72s)]
*  that the US is living in 1991. He's been in Washington for 50 years and he only remembers [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1730.0s)]
*  the unipolar moment. All of his instincts and experience have been shaped by that period of [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1736.0800000000002s)]
*  time when the US was the only superpower, that we were the global hegemon. We're no longer in [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1740.8s)]
*  that position anymore. First of all, Russia and China are strong. They are great powers too. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1747.52s)]
*  And Iran is much stronger than Iraq. Iran is four times the size of California and has roughly 90 [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1753.28s)]
*  million people. And they got a lot of engineers. And even if we did want to attack them, it's not [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1759.36s)]
*  exactly clear how you would stage that attack. Just getting to Iran would require flying over [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1763.68s)]
*  some very dangerous territory. It's not clear we have the bases or the air clearance [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1769.2s)]
*  rights from allies to be able to even get to Iran. Moreover, Iran apparently has a very strong missile [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1775.28s)]
*  program. So they may even have the ability to fire missiles or hypersonic missiles at our aircraft [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1780.8s)]
*  carriers that are sitting in the Mediterranean Sea. So if we get in a war with Iran, it's no joke. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1788.24s)]
*  This is not going to be shock and awe. This could be a very, very dangerous situation for the United [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1795.12s)]
*  States, which is why when people are just making these idle threats, they should be very careful [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1799.28s)]
*  about that because Iran is hearing that too and they're getting ready. And one last point on that, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1806.3999999999999s)]
*  thanks to our destabilizing the Middle East with the Iraq War and the Syria regime change operation, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1812.9599999999998s)]
*  Iran now has proxies in both Iraq and Syria. They've got Iraqi Hezbollah. They also have proxies [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1819.28s)]
*  in Yemen with the Houthis. And all of those groups could stage attacks on American military bases [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1828.0s)]
*  there. We've gone down the worst case scenario here, use of a nuclear bomb. The United States [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1833.6s)]
*  invading Iran. Here's just a list of the nine countries that are nuclear powered and that have [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1838.8799999999999s)]
*  nuclear bombs rather than nuclear powered. And as you can see Russia, US, China, France, UK, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1843.12s)]
*  Pakistan, India, Israel, and North Korea, Israel denies they actually have them. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1848.8s)]
*  And Pakistan has been the one who has been proliferating them, getting bombs to North Korea [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1853.84s)]
*  and helping Iran with their program. Iran obviously does not yet have a nuclear [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1861.6799999999998s)]
*  bomb, but we don't know how far they are because intelligence is sparse on that topic based on my [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1868.4s)]
*  cursory research. What's the best case scenario here, Trimah? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1874.48s)]
*  Sorry, Jake, I just want to be clear that I don't see nuclear use as likely. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1878.8s)]
*  Yes, that was free at Berg's point. Yeah. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1883.2s)]
*  Sorry, I did not say it was likely at all either. Not at all. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1886.0s)]
*  No, no, you said it's a small possibility and we just spent 10 minutes talking about that small [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1888.5600000000002s)]
*  possibility. Yes, just to everybody's clear. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1892.0s)]
*  Let's say something goes from 2% chance to 8% chance. It's now 4X in the next 20 years. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1893.84s)]
*  That's a significant shift in risk. And I think there have been others like Ray Dalio, I think, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1901.12s)]
*  or Warren Buffett. Some people have said that the chance of us using a nuclear weapon over a long [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1907.04s)]
*  enough period of time approximates 50 to 100%. It starts to get very high because at some point [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1911.52s)]
*  these things proliferate, the intelligence, the capabilities proliferate. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1918.8799999999999s)]
*  They get into the wrong hands. There's all these different scenarios that emerge. So the probability [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1923.44s)]
*  might be low on any given period of time. But over a long enough period of time, these things [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1927.04s)]
*  become a real concern. The nukes that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are like 20 kiloton [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1932.16s)]
*  yields. I mean, we have massive, massive, massive warhead, multi-warhead missiles that have [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1937.68s)]
*  many, many megatons of yield. But there are sub-20, sub-10 kiloton yield nukes [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1944.24s)]
*  that can be deployed in a conventional, in what people would call a tactical setting. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1948.96s)]
*  So you're not trying to- Yeah, the suitcase nuke, they're not literally [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1954.88s)]
*  suitcases. They're on trucks. But tactical nukes have been produced by Russia, China, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1958.72s)]
*  and the United States, are the known tactical nuclear powers. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1964.8s)]
*  Well, they're also, they're in different forms of delivery, but they're not, you know, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1968.0s)]
*  you don't take a bomber up and put it over a city and blast the whole city to send the rain. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1972.4s)]
*  No, you can drive them into a city in a van is the idea, yeah. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1975.6000000000001s)]
*  No, it's not necessarily about being on a van. It's like they can be on short range [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1978.72s)]
*  tactical systems. So the point is like, hey, you're caught in a corner, you have nowhere to go, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1982.48s)]
*  and you can't lose. And if you have one of these things, I mean, just take all human history aside [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1989.2s)]
*  and all convention aside. If you've got this thing, you're trapped in a corner, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1994.24s)]
*  you got nowhere to go, and you can press this button and win, you might press the button. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=1999.92s)]
*  And so let's do the other side. What's the best case scenario here? Obviously, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2006.48s)]
*  we haven't had the ground invasion. We've had Qatar and Saudi and a number in the United States, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2010.8s)]
*  obviously doing some pretty hardcore diplomacy. And we've had some hostages released. So, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2018.32s)]
*  you know, and I've been spending some time here in the Middle East, there is a very that people [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2025.28s)]
*  have brought up multiple times here that there's a deal going on right now to get the hostages, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2028.64s)]
*  a larger number of them. And that the ground invasion may not occur. This is just a theory [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2034.8s)]
*  that a number of people have been talking here, and maybe they're just optimists. But is there an [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2040.0s)]
*  optimistic scenario here? Is there a golden bridge out of here? Is there a possible path to, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2044.1599999999999s)]
*  you know, the peace process getting back on track? Or does it all just seem hopeless? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2052.08s)]
*  And if there is, and if there is a possible path, what would that look like? Let's just see if we [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2056.64s)]
*  can come up with any optimistic framing or theory here. Why it's just as bad as the other side. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2060.48s)]
*  Okay, so you don't see one? Yeah. How about we just look at the facts on the ground? The facts are [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2068.56s)]
*  that we have this long simmering war between Russia and Ukraine that doesn't seem to have an end. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2072.4s)]
*  And there doesn't seem to be a loss of life at which they're willing to stop, or whether [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2079.84s)]
*  the international community is willing to force a ceasefire. And then now you have this one, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2087.04s)]
*  which is in thousands and will escalate into the defense of thousands, but it seems like it's on [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2092.48s)]
*  a path to be slow and simmering. So I don't know what to say except that it does not seem to be [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2097.92s)]
*  escalating. And the reason it isn't escalating is that there is enough emotional impact [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2104.56s)]
*  that's causing people to understand that the stakes are high. And so when the actual actions [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2113.28s)]
*  are relatively de-escalatory, I find that the rhetoric ratchets up, right? It's almost inversely [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2121.2000000000003s)]
*  proportional. It's kind of like, what was the phrase in World War II about Churchill, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2129.6000000000004s)]
*  iron fist wrapped in a velvet glove? Is that the phrase? Something like that? But the idea [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2136.7200000000003s)]
*  is that when you act decisively, you say little, and when you have no plan of really escalating, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2141.68s)]
*  you say a lot. So I think that right now we're saying a lot, which actually counter-intuitively [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2146.7999999999997s)]
*  to me says we're not planning to do much of anything. And I think that that's good. So [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2152.96s)]
*  I'm all for Lindsey Graham braying as long as we don't take it too seriously and sleepwalking [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2157.68s)]
*  to some escalation. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2164.16s)]
*  Sacks, any chance that this gets de-escalated and what might that look like? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2165.92s)]
*  Sure. I think there's a chance. I think like, well, what it looks like, I think, is that [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2172.7200000000003s)]
*  the ground invasion keeps getting paused either because the U.S. needs more time to get its [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2180.7200000000003s)]
*  military in place or because the Israeli military realizes this is going to be a very difficult [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2187.92s)]
*  operation and they need more time to plan. And while that's happening, there's a serious [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2193.76s)]
*  diplomatic effort going on. And while that's happening, there's also more pressure being [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2198.4s)]
*  brought to bear against Israel to not go in. So for example, you saw Erdogan this week make [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2203.6800000000003s)]
*  some statements. I actually thought they were pretty outrageous where he described Hamas as [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2209.2000000000003s)]
*  basically being freedom fighters, but warning Israel not to go in. There were much more reasonable [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2212.48s)]
*  remarks by King Abdullah of Jordan, basically at least recognizing the atrocity that had taken [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2218.7200000000003s)]
*  place against Israel, but also trying to advocate for the lives of Palestinian civilians in Gaza [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2223.6s)]
*  and telling them that it would be a mistake to go in. So you're seeing like a wide range [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2233.04s)]
*  of opinions across, I'd say, major players in the Middle East, but all of it, the gist of it is [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2237.52s)]
*  basically telling the Israelis not to go in. So you've got all these delays and pressures going [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2243.36s)]
*  on. And so maybe there's some chance it could de-escalate. I personally think that that's still [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2248.4s)]
*  unlikely. And the main reason for that is I think Israel is determined to go in. I think [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2254.3199999999997s)]
*  Netanyahu has made that clear. I think from the Israeli point of view, they don't feel like they [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2260.88s)]
*  have a choice. They've suffered the biggest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, and they [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2265.68s)]
*  can't be perceived as simply standing by and doing nothing. That would make them look extremely weak [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2273.12s)]
*  in a region of the world where you don't want to look weak. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2279.28s)]
*  They have to annihilate Hamas, I guess is the thinking. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2282.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, they say that their objective is to destroy Hamas, but I think that probably from their [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2286.4s)]
*  standpoint, they'd consider it a success if they could significantly degrade Hamas, set them back [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2290.88s)]
*  10 years, destroy their capability to wage war against Israel, to undermine their tunnel networks [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2296.2400000000002s)]
*  and so forth. So I think Israel still feels like this is something they have to do. And so I kind [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2303.36s)]
*  of think that the most realistic good case scenario is that if they do go in, that the military [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2308.08s)]
*  operation for various reasons is not a long one and eventually a ceasefire can be agreed to [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2316.16s)]
*  before this can escalate out of control. And so there's a bunch of very delicate red lines there [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2322.24s)]
*  for a lot of different players. And so in order for that scenario to work out, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2329.44s)]
*  I think it's going to take some very deaf behind the scenes diplomacy from the Biden administration [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2334.24s)]
*  really. And I'm not sure they're capable. I'm not sure they're up to that task. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2339.44s)]
*  So this is why I think it's such a dangerous situation. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2342.96s)]
*  But can I ask you a question, by the way, is Nancy Graham speaking on behalf of the United States [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2345.52s)]
*  officially with the president's approval? He can't possibly be freelancing that. I didn't have any, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2349.44s)]
*  I tried to research it online. I couldn't find any [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2358.88s)]
*  Well, why don't you fill in the blanks, Jason? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2361.84s)]
*  If that was sanctioned or not. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2363.44s)]
*  Well, Jason, think about this. David texted this into the group chat and then tweeted it as well. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2365.76s)]
*  Do you think Mohammed bin Salman is meeting with a group of 10 senators that's just off on an [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2371.04s)]
*  adventure? No. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2376.2400000000002s)]
*  Okay. Well, there's your answer. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2380.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. No, no, I'm just- [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2381.36s)]
*  Look at this photo. I think the picture says a thousand words. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2382.96s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2385.84s)]
*  So you have a delegation of senators, I count about 10 senators there. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2387.0400000000004s)]
*  There's 10 of them on the list. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2391.76s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. They're meeting with Mohammed bin Salman. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2393.36s)]
*  Five Republicans and five Democrats. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2395.6000000000004s)]
*  And who has the seat of honor right next to MBS in the front of the room? [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2397.92s)]
*  So I personally would like to believe that Lindsey Graham is just an outlier and he doesn't speak [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2401.76s)]
*  for anybody. But unfortunately, this delegation saw fit to put him in the front of the room. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2405.6800000000003s)]
*  I consider that very scary. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2411.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, I think it's also fair to say that the office of MBS would have coordinated that [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2413.52s)]
*  decision with the White House before receiving them. That's typical political protocol. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2419.04s)]
*  Yeah. It just was never explicitly said. He didn't say on behalf of the president or the [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2423.52s)]
*  president has sent us here. It just seemed like a disjoint. I hadn't never seen that before. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2428.32s)]
*  All right. I guess we'll move on to some business issues here. The macro picture is quite [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2434.48s)]
*  confounding GDP, as we were talking about in our group chat grew 4.9% year over year in Q3, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2441.28s)]
*  higher than the 4.3% expectations and much higher than the 2.1% growth in Q2, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2447.76s)]
*  highest year over year GDP since Q4 2021. And we thought we were going into a recession, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2453.2000000000003s)]
*  we'd have a couple of quarters of contraction that hasn't happened. CPI in September was 3.7, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2459.44s)]
*  slightly above the 3.6 estimates. And Chamath, what do you take from all of this is crazy, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2465.68s)]
*  high growth GDP? Is this because of stimulus, government spending? What is this confounding, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2472.56s)]
*  you know, inflation coming down and getting somewhat under control and then crazy GDP growth? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2479.2s)]
*  I don't know. I don't think anybody knows. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2485.52s)]
*  But it's really confounding for the markets. I think it's really bad for markets in general. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2487.44s)]
*  It's probably the worst for private companies, because you have this effect now where everybody's [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2496.4s)]
*  been wanting to price in a recession, right? Everybody wants to see that shoe drop where [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2503.12s)]
*  they say, oh, okay, here it is. Something's softening, demand is softening. And then when [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2509.04s)]
*  you see a print like this, where the economy is expanding, you're kind of confused. And you're [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2514.88s)]
*  like, well, where is this softening going to come from? And so what happens is people become very [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2519.6800000000003s)]
*  over reactive to small amounts of data. And that actually started to come out, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2525.84s)]
*  I think, basically since August. And what's been happening since August is that every time [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2532.88s)]
*  a company reports, the sector that's gotten the most attention has been fintechs. And the reason [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2537.6800000000003s)]
*  is that fintechs tend to be on the bleeding edge of capturing consumer demand. And if consumer demand [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2542.8s)]
*  shrinks, that's probably the first sign that there's going to be a recession, right? Because [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2549.1200000000003s)]
*  consumption is about almost 70% of the US economy. And so since August, what you've seen are the large [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2554.1600000000003s)]
*  leading edge public fintech companies just get absolutely murdered. And yesterday was an even [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2561.1200000000003s)]
*  worse day, because what happened yesterday was a company was basically world line, started to [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2567.68s)]
*  report softness in spending. Now that spending was not even in America, that spending actually [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2572.96s)]
*  happened to be within a segment of their customer base in Germany. And that was enough to just [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2578.64s)]
*  literally sink the stock, I think, 60% in a day. So we have on the surface, a healthy growing economy. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2585.44s)]
*  But underneath the surface, what we what we are betting on, increasingly, is that consumer demand [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2593.28s)]
*  has basically stopped. So you can see here, ADIEN is down 50% since the beginning of the year. But [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2602.2400000000002s)]
*  again, most of this was since August. Block is down another 35%, PayPal is down 30%. So, so that's one [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2608.96s)]
*  thing, which is this is a big bet, that consumption is slowing and shrinking, the economy will be in a [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2616.0s)]
*  recession over these next two or three quarters, which will give the Fed the motivation and the [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2622.24s)]
*  justification to lower rates starting in the middle of next year. That's the big bet in the market. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2628.3999999999996s)]
*  But separately, if you take a different lens and look at this data, we all have a bigger problem in [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2634.72s)]
*  Silicon Valley land, which is, how do the capital markets take companies public when this is [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2640.3999999999996s)]
*  happening? And the reason why this data is so important is, we've said this 1000 times, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2647.52s)]
*  there are only two companies that can structurally open the capital markets for all startups. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2652.64s)]
*  One is SpaceX Starlink, but that's on its own path, and not going public soon. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2659.44s)]
*  And the other is Stripe. And you could probably add TikTok to that as well. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2666.56s)]
*  Yeah. No, because that's a Chinese company with all kinds of overhangs. So no, I would disagree. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2670.16s)]
*  With 30 or 40% US ownership. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2674.48s)]
*  I would disagree with that. But no. So I think it's Starlink and Stripe. And the problem now [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2676.48s)]
*  for Stripe is that the public comps dollar for dollar are off 50%, which from the beginning of [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2684.2400000000002s)]
*  the year, which then says that if you apply that rateably to its valuation, they did around at [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2691.04s)]
*  55 billion, then the market clearing trade may be 25 to 30 billion now. Now 25 to 30 billion for [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2696.4s)]
*  Stripe, you're incinerating $70 billion of equity value, right, and about five to $10 billion of [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2704.0s)]
*  actually paying capital. So what does that do for Silicon Valley and for VCs? I think it's going to [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2710.4s)]
*  put a lot of pressure on companies and valuations. So yeah, we're in for a real slog. So on the [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2716.4s)]
*  surface for the real economy, I think it's generally decent news. For startup land, I think it's not [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2724.64s)]
*  good. And then specifically within startup land sectors like fintech are in pretty bad trouble, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2732.8s)]
*  I think. And the late stage, obviously still very much in trouble. Freeberg, any thoughts on the [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2738.0800000000004s)]
*  startup economy? You had some thoughts on this, I think, too. I'd like to hear your guys's [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2742.48s)]
*  experiences, but there's definitely been a big hold up in series BCD later rounds, because [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2746.4s)]
*  so much of the market questioning is, you know, when, when is the next round going to get done, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2753.44s)]
*  which is based on when can the companies potentially go public. And ultimately, if you [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2760.16s)]
*  don't see a path to a window opening up, you don't fund the pre IPO round, you don't fund the late [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2765.52s)]
*  stage round, the growth stage round, everything gets held up. And a lot of rounds that are getting [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2771.2799999999997s)]
*  done lately have been these kind of convert or bridge rounds where existing investors are funding [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2775.44s)]
*  the company to give it another year or two of runway. That was definitely the case for most of [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2780.7999999999997s)]
*  this year coming out of 22. I think post the summer, it seems like a lot of folks I'm talking [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2784.72s)]
*  to are starting to wake up, there's even more series B at lower prices, and everyone's kind [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2790.9599999999996s)]
*  of capitulating and accepting that there are still great businesses out there. It's just that they [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2795.9199999999996s)]
*  got overpriced in their A or their B. And let's price them at a lower valuation and then rounds [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2800.08s)]
*  are sort of starting to get done in the fall here. I'll have you react to this data, Sachs. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2805.2s)]
*  Carta manages cap tables for folks, but they have produced this chart. And this is Carta [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2810.32s)]
*  companies only. So this is a subsection who knows Carta may power the cap tables of 10% 20% [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2816.8s)]
*  of Silicon Valley, the rest are done on other pieces of software or even in Google Sheets, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2823.44s)]
*  or literally in an Excel sheet by an attorney who is working with the company. If you look at this [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2828.8s)]
*  chart in 2020 and 2021, you had about 70 startups shutting down per quarter in 2022, you see that [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2836.48s)]
*  number double. And we start seeing 129 141 a quarter. And then in 2023, this last quarter, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2845.04s)]
*  Q3 rocketing up to 2020. So roughly three times what we see in the boom markets, Sachs, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2853.76s)]
*  and any thoughts on this data? I have a couple of observations, but I want to go to you first. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2859.92s)]
*  Well, this is not surprising to me at all. This is the bubble of 2021 working its way through the [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2863.84s)]
*  system. We know that there were these gigantic rounds that were funded in 2021, especially in [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2870.0s)]
*  the second half where you had this asset super bubble. It wasn't just in tech, it was like all [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2876.1600000000003s)]
*  growth stocks, crypto, everything. And so there were a lot of startups that raised huge funding [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2881.28s)]
*  rounds at the peak of the market and they haven't had to raise for a couple of years. Well, now [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2886.88s)]
*  they're starting to run out of cash and they do have to raise. They're finally being forced to [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2892.4s)]
*  go back into market. And a lot of them are either burning too much money or they don't have the [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2896.2400000000002s)]
*  numbers to justify another round. Or if they do, it's a structured round, a down round. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2900.56s)]
*  Or again, they just are unable to raise. They have a broken process and they eventually start [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2906.1600000000003s)]
*  winding down. So I think you're going to see this dynamic for the next 18 months or so. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2911.12s)]
*  But this is not a new dynamic. This is the lagging indicator of what we've been talking about [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2915.6800000000003s)]
*  since the regime change of the first half of 2022 is that the markets started looking for [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2920.24s)]
*  different things instead of growth at all costs. It's been about growth with unit economics and [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2927.2799999999997s)]
*  efficiency and the valuations went way down and there's a lot of companies that no longer qualify [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2932.3999999999996s)]
*  and they're getting weeded out. So this is just a delayed reaction to things we already knew. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2937.68s)]
*  Aaron Norris That's the key part. The delayed reaction as well. I'll just note when a company [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2942.4799999999996s)]
*  does shut down, that process typically takes two or three quarters. And for a founder to accept [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2946.48s)]
*  the shutdown, that might take one, two, three quarters as well. So anything you're seeing in [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2952.0s)]
*  2023, that might be a shutdown where the employees were all laid off in late 2022. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2955.92s)]
*  David Tenenbaum But I mean, I have a question for you guys. What turns this around? [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2960.8s)]
*  Aaron Norris I'll tell you what I'm seeing in the early stage. We are seeing many companies come to [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2964.8s)]
*  Founder University and two or three people who want to build a company who can't get jobs at [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2969.44s)]
*  Google or Shripe. They're not hiring. So we'll see two or three developer teams working on a project [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2974.4s)]
*  and then raising 250, 500K at a five to $12 million valuation and then very quickly getting to 10 to [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2980.32s)]
*  50K monthly revenue. David Tenenbaum But what about all this money that we need to return so that we [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2987.6s)]
*  can recycle and keep doing this job? What needs to happen, Sax, Friedberg? What do you guys think [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2992.4s)]
*  needs to happen to get to crack? Because like the three IPOs we've had have not fared particularly [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=2998.64s)]
*  well. And the market just seems to get harder and harder for tech companies, even profitable ones, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3004.64s)]
*  right? Sax Hockenheim Yeah, I mean, I think profitability is key. I think that's the great [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3012.8799999999997s)]
*  evolutionary forcing function here. It's like a tale of two world of two startups. The one startup [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3016.8799999999997s)]
*  needs cash for a long period of time. And the other one's found a path to profitability. The [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3022.56s)]
*  one that's found a path to profitability, they have an infinite number of options available to [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3027.12s)]
*  them. It might take longer to get public or whatever. But they can wait it out because they [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3031.12s)]
*  don't need money. The one that needs cash continuously and will for a long period of time [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3035.52s)]
*  is really screwed. David Tenenbaum What about the multiple of these profitable companies that [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3040.24s)]
*  seems to have changed materially? Sax Hockenheim I'll tell you something that's starting to happen [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3043.68s)]
*  as well, Chamath, is that the public markets are looking at their stocks if they're undervalued. And [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3047.12s)]
*  then Dara Uber is reportedly planning like buying back upwards of 20% of the Uber shares in the next [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3051.52s)]
*  five years. And then you look at a company like Snap, which is majority control with super voting [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3058.72s)]
*  shares, they're still losing three or 400 million a quarter. So I think Freiburg is exactly right, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3062.56s)]
*  tale of two cities, some people refuse. And then if the stock is so cheap, people start buying it [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3068.32s)]
*  back. And the freezing of employees and the expenses going down while revenue goes up and [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3073.2s)]
*  earnings increase. I think that's the setup. If you're looking for the setup, I think it's [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3079.6s)]
*  the public market companies showing the path profitability buying back stock. And then these [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3083.52s)]
*  small companies- David Tenenbaum I don't understand how does that help private companies go public? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3087.2799999999997s)]
*  Sax Hockenheim If the private companies follow suit, and they're profitable, and they control [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3091.68s)]
*  costs, and people get greedy looking at how profitable they are, as opposed to their 50% [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3096.3199999999997s)]
*  growth rate, they start looking at their increasing earnings and how much cash they're throwing off. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3101.92s)]
*  And I think that's starting to trickle down through the startup ecosystem. People are [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3106.0s)]
*  trying to get to profit profitability quickly. The question was, can people turn around? If they do, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3109.12s)]
*  that's what it's going to be is profitability. Peter Trenum Yeah, I mean, I think you guys are [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3116.72s)]
*  kind of talking about two different things. Sure, any particular company can still get its house in [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3119.68s)]
*  order and create a great business and they'll eventually get liquidity, they'll go public. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3124.08s)]
*  The question is, I think what Trimoth is getting at is that the exit comps have changed. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3129.68s)]
*  If you were a tech investor, or let's say a real estate investor, before the regime changed, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3134.3199999999997s)]
*  you were underwriting to a completely different exit comp. And now those exit comps have totally [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3139.7599999999998s)]
*  changed. And so it's going to be very hard for those investors to make a good return. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3144.72s)]
*  Peter Trenum But they're going to lose their money like Instacart. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3149.4399999999996s)]
*  David Tenenbaum Yeah. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3151.2799999999997s)]
*  Peter Trenum I'll give you a mathematical example just to illustrate what David just said. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3151.7599999999998s)]
*  If you have a company with 300 million of ARR, you are in a rare group of, say, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3156.4799999999996s)]
*  30 or 40 companies, period. Okay? So very, very, very few companies get to that level of scale. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3163.1200000000003s)]
*  But if you are at 100% net dollar retention, okay, which means that you're kind of treading [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3169.28s)]
*  water, essentially. Your customers may grow, but the value of each customer isn't particularly [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3175.84s)]
*  growing. So you know, you have you have pretty nominal growth. That company now comps to roughly [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3181.84s)]
*  three to five times ARR. Now the problem is, if you go and look back through Crunchbase, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3189.6s)]
*  or any of these other, serve a pitch book, the number of companies that traded above $1.5 billion [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3195.92s)]
*  dollar valuation as a SaaS business, there's like 70 of them, but there's only seven of them that [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3203.84s)]
*  have 300 million of ARR. So what do you what happens guys, like the jig is up? Okay. What's [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3209.36s)]
*  going on here? Consolidation, I guess, and some of them will flame out. I mean, look at Instacart, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3217.68s)]
*  the people who were the last four rounds, they either lost money or broke even. So, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3224.7999999999997s)]
*  and that means time adjusted versus what they could have made in the markets. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3229.8399999999997s)]
*  They lost money. So what happens if Stripe is only worth 30? I mean, how much has been invested into [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3234.0s)]
*  that company? What's the total paid in capital? Again, I think we all want Stripe to be worth 100. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3240.08s)]
*  We want it to be worth 200 billion, because it would help. Frankly, it is the rising tide [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3245.28s)]
*  that lifts all boats. But if unit level profitability is scrutinized and then comped appropriately to [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3251.76s)]
*  the public markets, as Sack said, we're going to have to take that signal and apply it to our [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3257.36s)]
*  entire portfolio. And so it goes all the way back to eventually the seed in the Series A as well, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3263.76s)]
*  which is really good. Jason, as you've said many times, just getting the inflation under control [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3270.8s)]
*  and in check, but it will mean not just changing valuations, but it will mean changing salaries. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3275.36s)]
*  Right? It will mean totally different equity packages. A lot of hard work. I almost think that [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3281.6800000000003s)]
*  maybe none of the hard work has actually yet started. So I don't know, I'm just putting that [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3287.44s)]
*  out there, guys. Do you think that we've all just kind of been hoping maybe that all of this would [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3293.04s)]
*  pass? And now we're getting more and more signals that we actually have to do a pretty hard valuation [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3298.56s)]
*  reset? Yeah. I mean, if you look at the Altimeter charts that J.M.M. Balls put out, I mean, the [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3305.36s)]
*  valuation levels are returning to, let's call it the pre-COVID mean. In fact, they're slightly below [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3310.32s)]
*  the pre-COVID mean because the 10-year treasury has a higher rate. So yeah, we're going back to [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3316.32s)]
*  something that was more like, I don't know, 2015 levels of valuation and maybe even slightly worse, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3323.12s)]
*  again, because long-term rates are higher. So cost of capital and hurdle rate are higher. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3329.6s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. I'm seeing 2012 valuations. Valuation of Uber when I invest was five million. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3335.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Let me just tell you, it's a lot harder for people to make money when the money supply [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3340.96s)]
*  is shrinking than when the money supply is growing. For obvious reasons, when the money supply is [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3344.48s)]
*  shrinking, it's like you're playing a game of musical chairs and you're just hoping that you [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3351.36s)]
*  still have a seat. Whereas when the pie is increasing, it's a lot easier to get a piece of it. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3355.84s)]
*  But when the pie is shrinking, it's a lot harder to get a piece. Musical chairs, as you described [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3360.8s)]
*  it, is what you're... It's literally the description of the venture capital industry and GPs right now. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3365.1200000000003s)]
*  A lot of people are losing their seats. Yeah. And I think there's going to be a lot of shutdowns of [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3370.7200000000003s)]
*  venture firms. I think a lot of venture firms are going to shut down. This could be zombie funds. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3374.6400000000003s)]
*  I think we got to believe the extraordinary outcomes make up the bulk of returns in venture [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3379.2s)]
*  from the singular companies. And there's a few of them. There's $15 billion exits created every [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3388.3199999999997s)]
*  year. I don't know if it's unicorns as valued in private markets or actual exits, but as we know, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3396.64s)]
*  every couple of years, there's a company that comes along that's worth 10 billion. And every [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3402.64s)]
*  once a decade, there's a company that comes along that ends up being worth 100 billion. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3406.64s)]
*  And the bulk of the returns in the entire venture landscape comes from those handful of companies. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3410.24s)]
*  I think we end up focusing a lot on market metrics as the performance driver for venture returns. But [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3416.8s)]
*  the truth is, it's the performance driver for the mid-tier of venture returns. And that mid-tier [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3424.4s)]
*  of venture returns is skating along at 2x multiple after 10 years or 3x after 10, 2 to 2 to 2.5x [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3429.92s)]
*  after 10 years. That's the top quarter. Right. And so whatever it is, 1.8x, and now those guys [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3437.92s)]
*  are all underwater. So instead of being 1.8x, they're all going to return 0.7x or 0.5x, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3442.32s)]
*  and they're going to lose money. No, I think the 50th percentile returns money. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3446.96s)]
*  Okay. But the truth is, so now they're going to lose money. But the truth is, whichever funds [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3451.6800000000003s)]
*  get the tiger by the tail, whoever gets the Uber at 5 million, whoever gets the slack at whatever [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3456.8s)]
*  you got in at, whoever got to the SpaceX or whatever Saks got in at, you're going to be fine [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3464.4s)]
*  because the multiples in markets don't matter as much if you're generating 4,000x. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3469.04s)]
*  No, I don't think that's true. I don't think that's true because if it happens in a fund [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3473.1200000000003s)]
*  and that all of those deals, except SpaceX, happened in a different valuation framework [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3477.6000000000004s)]
*  where rates were zero. So I think the question, the more intellectually honest question is, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3484.4s)]
*  what would Slack and Uber have gone public at today with a 5% 10 year? And I think the answer, [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3489.2000000000003s)]
*  if you're going to be intellectually honest, is a very different valuation than when it went out [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3496.0s)]
*  when the 10 year was zero. It's going to be hard to make outsized returns unless and until [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3500.4s)]
*  the entry price is completely correct. And I think they've partially corrected, but they may [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3505.76s)]
*  not have fully corrected because people, I think, always want to believe that there's going to be a [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3510.24s)]
*  bounce back and it takes time to kill that hope. I think that capitulation is... No, I think that [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3514.9599999999996s)]
*  capitulation is starting to happen, to be honest. I mean, that was my observation. I feel like [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3524.7999999999997s)]
*  everything was so shut down last year, the start of this year through the summer, and then in the [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3530.3999999999996s)]
*  fall, like just the last couple of months, it feels like there's this capitulation where it's like, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3536.64s)]
*  okay, we're worth 80% less, but we need money. Let's do the deal. Okay, we'll put money in. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3541.52s)]
*  I don't think the reset can happen until Stripe goes public. I'll be very specific. I think that [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3547.2s)]
*  is the company that sets the cascading valuation framework for every other company. So I think all [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3552.3199999999997s)]
*  of this is a bunch of people, us, blathering on and making stuff up. I think the true numerical [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3558.64s)]
*  forcing function, the clearing event happens when they go public because it will be... You won't be [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3566.16s)]
*  able to hide. I think we all would say it's the best-run company that's private. It's [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3571.04s)]
*  the most technical. It's gotten the most people. It's gotten the most pristine cap table. It's [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3577.04s)]
*  raised the most money at the... It's done everything right. It's the gold standard, yes. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3581.3599999999997s)]
*  What their valuation is, is then what you can expect if you are of that caliber, or you can [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3586.96s)]
*  expect a lower valuation if you are not of their caliber. I think that until we know what that is, [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3594.08s)]
*  we're all going to be hoping, but we know that hope isn't a strategy. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3600.72s)]
*  So my takeaway from all of this is just more that people have to really right-size the portfolio, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3606.08s)]
*  sell what you can, find liquidity where there are people that want to buy at different entry prices. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3612.56s)]
*  They may not be the price that you thought originally, but it makes sense for them and [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3618.24s)]
*  their risk profile in this moment in time. All of this stuff has to happen to actively manage [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3623.04s)]
*  to exits, I think. Well, and there's a new phenomenon that's going on that I've been seeing a [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3626.88s)]
*  lot of. I've been approached by a number of people who are buying strips of GP interest and strips of [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3630.72s)]
*  LP interest in venture funds from the last 10 years. I got offered for a 5X on paper fund, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3636.88s)]
*  like 3 point whatever X, and you could clear out, like you're saying, some of your shares. I got [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3643.04s)]
*  offered half price basically by some people who I think, I don't want to say the bottom feeders, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3649.6s)]
*  but I think they're maybe optimistic about certain names. I've noticed that the amount [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3654.88s)]
*  of activity from secondary brokers seems to have increased. Yeah, and specifically the emails that [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3660.88s)]
*  I get that are interesting are the ones where they're asking me to sell shares. So when someone's [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3668.08s)]
*  offering you, that doesn't mean anything because there may not be any transactions clearing, but [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3673.52s)]
*  when they have definite buyer interest at a certain price, that tells you that the market [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3677.36s)]
*  now has found or is in the process of finding the market clearing price. So I think we do actually [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3683.52s)]
*  know from the secondary market kind of where a lot of these unicorns are at. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3690.8s)]
*  My guess is- And what would you say on average? Half? [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3696.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Half price? I'd say there's a lot of half price. That's what I see. I see a lot of half [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3699.44s)]
*  price action. Which to me- I'm not trying to be a wet blanket guys, but the average SaaS company [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3702.88s)]
*  that's public is down 75%. If you look at the fintech space, these companies are down 80 to 90%. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3707.36s)]
*  So how can half be reasonable? Well, it's just for certain names. Yeah. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3714.08s)]
*  Because I think the really bad names don't get any liquidity. There's just no buyers. So you're [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3717.28s)]
*  talking about names where there's already a buyer, so that's going to bias it towards the better [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3722.32s)]
*  companies. No, no. I'm saying when Square and Odd Gen, these are great companies that are down 80%, [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3726.8s)]
*  90%. How can a private liquid company be only down 50%? Maybe it's not priced correctly, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3731.6s)]
*  but maybe also there's been two or three years of growth since that last private valuation. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3739.12s)]
*  So maybe there's some selection bias. Maybe there's 20, 30% growth. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3745.04s)]
*  Yeah. But Odd Gen and Square have also grown by 50%. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3749.8399999999997s)]
*  We have a comp on this, which is Instacart, 39 billion peak profit market valuation. It's [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3755.36s)]
*  trading at like six and a half billion, which I think is exactly what you said, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3760.0s)]
*  Jamath. When we were pricing it, we looked at that 800 million. I think we're not. No, [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3764.24s)]
*  but I had said 800 million and I just put it at like, there was 800 million in advertising revenue [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3769.84s)]
*  and I said, okay, you know, seven, eight, nine times that top line or if I said if it was, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3774.88s)]
*  if it was 50% margin, you can give it 20X. So I think that's how I came up with my number. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3780.08s)]
*  And I think we came up with eight based on that. And sure enough, that's basically where it's [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3784.64s)]
*  trading 6.8 billion. Yeah, that's amazing. It's down 26% since it IPO'd. Now I will say that [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3790.64s)]
*  Instacart is an example of a company that has historically had very high burn and it's a very [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3797.68s)]
*  capital intensive business relatively, whereas a good software business, like take a Clavio, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3804.08s)]
*  for example, is much more capital efficient and should be doing better. Clavio is down 16% [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3809.44s)]
*  since this IPO. Yeah, market cap out seven billion. So yeah, it's an ugly story. I mean, [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3816.16s)]
*  even for the names that just IPO'd, it's not looking too good. Yeah. I mean, revenue profits [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3820.64s)]
*  that clears it out. I do think there's going to be a lot of GPs who are- Arm down 21% since this [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3826.0s)]
*  IPO. That's a lot of money. Yeah. Look, I think the market has just turned very negative very [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3833.36s)]
*  recently. It comes back to this GDP report. When I saw the 4.9% number, I mean, the thing that [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3838.24s)]
*  occurred to me, the larger theme is that there's such a divergence right now between Main Street [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3845.7599999999998s)]
*  and Wall Street. Explain why the GDP is so strong right now. And that would indicate [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3850.9599999999996s)]
*  that the economy is strong, therefore, stocks should go up. Why is that not happening? I think [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3856.64s)]
*  this is the one that's maybe confusing for people. Well, I mean, I'm not sure I can fully explain [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3862.4799999999996s)]
*  it because I think there's a lot of contradictory data. But if you look at Main Street, you're [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3867.52s)]
*  seeing whatever 4.9% GDP growth, you're seeing pretty robust employment numbers. The consumer [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3871.68s)]
*  seems to be holding up. But if you look at Wall Street and the investment side of things, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3878.16s)]
*  it's pretty miserable. The whole stock market this year is being held up by seven stocks. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3882.56s)]
*  The so-called Magnificent Seven is the top seven tech names in the S&P 500. If you look at the [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3887.92s)]
*  overall S&P 500, excluding those names, it's flat for the year. And it's basically giving back all [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3894.0s)]
*  the gains. And now those seven names are starting to crack. So just in the last week or so. Google [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3900.96s)]
*  and Tesla went down a bit. Yeah. We're seeing them go down. And Facebook. So we're seeing, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3905.52s)]
*  and then, you know, Microsoft had a great quarter, but it's now down. It's given back that pop. So [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3912.56s)]
*  you're seeing that on the investment side of things, it's still pretty grim out there because [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3917.92s)]
*  people are now pricing in higher rates for longer. That's basically what's happening. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3924.88s)]
*  And the thing I wonder about, I mean, here's the disconnect, is that ultimately what happens on [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3930.4s)]
*  Wall Street affects the consumer. Their 401ks go down in value. The value of their houses go down, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3937.6000000000004s)]
*  because now, if you sell your house, you lose your 3% mortgage. Now you have to get a new one at 8%. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3946.2400000000002s)]
*  So everyone stopped trying to sell their house. The number of real estate transactions has gone [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3952.32s)]
*  down a lot. That's gradually working its way through the system. So at some point, the consumer [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3956.32s)]
*  realizes that they're just not as wealthy as they thought they were. That's the wealth effect. And [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3961.1200000000003s)]
*  they just stopped spending as freely. And we already know that credit card debt, and especially [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3965.52s)]
*  credit card servicing costs, are at all time highs because of these high interest rates. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3970.64s)]
*  So at some point, you just wonder if the consumer is like Wiley Coyote and has gone off a cliff, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3975.8399999999997s)]
*  but just hasn't looked down yet. Yeah, just like the country, just like our government. It's like [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3982.3199999999997s)]
*  we're just, everybody's just spending and nobody's actually paying attention to the balance sheet, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3986.64s)]
*  whether it's the government or individuals, apparently, because credit card debts now at its [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3991.92s)]
*  highest. And people are still yellow. I mean, it's because the only possible explanation with the [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=3995.44s)]
*  consumer is that consumers' wages and the unemployment, the low unemployment, persistent [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4001.68s)]
*  low unemployment, the number of jobs available, it's just making everybody super confident. But [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4008.56s)]
*  that's got to end at some point, right? Doesn't it? I think companies keep cutting their belts. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4012.88s)]
*  I don't think Wall Street and Main Street can be disconnected forever. I think it's got to [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4016.8s)]
*  reconcile one way or another. Yeah, I agree. So I would describe our economic situation as [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4020.48s)]
*  fragile. I mean, I think most commentators, like Bill Ackman, still thinks that things are going to [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4026.2400000000002s)]
*  turn south, that this GDP number is sort of a peak number. I don't know. These things still seem kind [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4032.16s)]
*  of shaky to me. This could be one of the- Not exactly the recipe that you want when you have [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4038.4s)]
*  this massive geopolitical instability. Yeah, exactly. That double whammy. And then plus the [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4044.56s)]
*  election coming up and the chaos that that could cause in the country. It's kind of like that quote [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4049.92s)]
*  about going bankrupt. How did it happen? Slowly and then all at once. I think that's kind of what [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4056.16s)]
*  we're heading towards. This has been happening slowly and then everybody's going to wake up with [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4061.04s)]
*  a heck of a credit card bill at 15 or 20%. And they're not going to be able to pay it. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4065.52s)]
*  The government will have to intervene. They can't be in a situation where- [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4070.96s)]
*  I agree with Chema. A large percent of the US consumers just can't. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4076.24s)]
*  This is my point of view on consumer and all this commercial real estate and the bank loans. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4080.88s)]
*  Eventually the Fed monetizes all this stuff. It's the only path, which by the way, [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4086.16s)]
*  will inflate a lot of financial assets. And if that happens- [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4091.44s)]
*  Actually, you bring up another data point we haven't discussed, which is there's a major [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4095.52s)]
*  storm cloud out there, which is major US banks are facing large unrealized losses. Bank of America [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4098.8s)]
*  had unrealized losses of $131 billion on securities in Q3. JP Morgan Chase had unrealized [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4105.84s)]
*  losses of $40 billion in its health and maturity portfolio in Q3. And Citigroup did not disclose [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4112.0s)]
*  its losses for Q3, but it had $24 billion of losses at the end of Q2. Remember this dynamic [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4120.16s)]
*  that we had with SVB and all these banks back in, was it like March? Where all these regional [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4126.4s)]
*  banks were basically had these large unrealized losses and then it created a run on a few of them? [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4131.599999999999s)]
*  Well, now the biggest banks are starting to face that unrealized losses problem. Now, [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4136.4s)]
*  I don't think Bank of America, JP Morgan, or Citigroup are going to have a run on the bank, [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4140.96s)]
*  but they're clearly not doing that great. And at some point, there's going to have to be a [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4146.0s)]
*  reconciliation of that. Unless they hold it to maturity, I guess. We should do just a quick hit [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4150.879999999999s)]
*  here on this cruise follow-up story. We had talked earlier about the cruise accident and [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4155.52s)]
*  self-driving. Well, a lot of news has come out about this gentleman that is potentially explosive. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4162.0s)]
*  As we all know, just to catch everybody up on October 2nd, there was a hit and run accident. And [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4169.84s)]
*  this tangentially included that cruise vehicle, the cruise vehicle. A woman tragically got hit by a car, [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4175.360000000001s)]
*  driven by a human. That car ran off. The woman got knocked into in front of a cruise [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4183.28s)]
*  self-driving car, which then ran her over. Okay. California's DMV has suspended cruise [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4190.5599999999995s)]
*  and their permit because allegedly the company withheld footage of the incident. If you remember, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4197.599999999999s)]
*  we had a little discussion here about the taxi had rolled over the person. And then we talked about, [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4204.48s)]
*  hey, you know, you're not supposed to move off of the person when we did our whole joke about [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4209.28s)]
*  EMT J-Cal. Well, it turns out after the AV collision, the cruise vehicle apparently [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4213.44s)]
*  pulled the woman forward 20 feet. And this has been confirmed now by cruise. But when cruise [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4221.759999999999s)]
*  gave that information to the regulatory agency, the California DMV, they didn't show that footage. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4227.36s)]
*  In other words, they showed just the first half of the footage. And that has gotten their license [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4235.92s)]
*  suspended. So we have, or we're left to interpret why did cruise not tell the full truth to the DMV? [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4241.04s)]
*  And now, Friedberg, to your point about society taking risks, now we have allegedly cruise. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4248.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know what the most generous way to say this is, but they either [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4258.64s)]
*  omitted or they straight up lied to the California DMV. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4262.16s)]
*  I mean, J-Cal, if it's true that they lied and were deceptive about the video, then yeah, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4268.08s)]
*  that's like do not pass go directly to jail time. I mean, that's really bad. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4272.879999999999s)]
*  One point I made last time was that I didn't think cruise was sophisticated enough tech or really GM, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4278.4s)]
*  who's their backer was sophisticated enough technologically to get this right. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4284.879999999999s)]
*  And I still maintain that. And so if on top of that, they were deceptive about what happened, [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4289.04s)]
*  then that's like the kill shot. One question I have J-Cal is there was an NBC reporter who [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4295.44s)]
*  was on the scene just happened to be on the scene. And I remember her reporting that cruise was not [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4301.44s)]
*  responsible. So I'm just wondering, like where the disconnect here is between all these various [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4307.04s)]
*  reports. I have a theory. I have a theory which is not responsible for the accident, [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4312.8s)]
*  but then responsible potentially for the subsequent the dragging of the body. So [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4318.24s)]
*  I think that's the issue here is that they may be able to claim, hey, we had nothing to do with the [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4323.76s)]
*  accident. But then in what happened after the accident, yes, the technology fell apparently, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4328.4800000000005s)]
*  or maybe the technology never took into account what happens if you run somebody over that was [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4334.72s)]
*  rocketed under your car. And maybe that's just a free accident that we have to get used to that [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4339.28s)]
*  possibility happening. And that could happen with obviously human drivers. So it's just a possibility [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4343.679999999999s)]
*  that that can happen. You don't think that that edge case is hard coded? I mean, the edge case of [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4349.12s)]
*  how would the car know there's a person underneath it? I don't know. But you're bringing up something [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4357.5199999999995s)]
*  so obvious as to be comical, which is like, of course, there has to be some emergency cut off [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4362.4s)]
*  when there's like some obstruction. Anyway, sure. Let's let all the facts come out. I think we'll [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4370.0s)]
*  wait for the rest of the facts to come out. We've got I think 80% of them here, 90% of them. But [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4375.36s)]
*  Freberg, you had told us in the group chat that Hurricane Otis would potentially be disastrous [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4379.839999999999s)]
*  for Mexico. And turns out you are correct. 27 people are dead in Mexico. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4386.72s)]
*  And maybe you could explain to us why this storm is unique. And why, if you think this, that we're [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4394.48s)]
*  seeing more of these? Or are we seeing more of these? Or is the coverage in the media? Yeah, [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4401.44s)]
*  you know, in the reaction to it, getting distorted. I don't know about the media coverage. The big [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4406.5599999999995s)]
*  story with Hurricane Otis is that it went from being kind of a tropical storm to being a category [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4411.12s)]
*  five hurricane in about six hours. And then it made landfall in Acapulco at a category five hurricane. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4418.64s)]
*  And no hurricane forecasting models had predicted this. And hurricane forecasting models are what [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4425.28s)]
*  are typically run off of ensemble models, meaning that there are multiple things that may happen. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4432.32s)]
*  And that those simulations are run on very compute intensive systems. And there are many, many [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4437.68s)]
*  simulations being run all the time. Every six hours, these simulation runs are done. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4444.72s)]
*  And then you look at these and you create a probability of things that may happen. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4449.04s)]
*  And none of the forecasts had any probability associated with this event happening. It was so [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4452.96s)]
*  out of the bounds of anything we have seen historically, that none of the models had any [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4458.08s)]
*  chance ascribed to this tropical storm suddenly evolving into a category five hurricane in six [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4463.36s)]
*  hours and then making landfall on a city with a million people. We can look at pictures if you [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4469.679999999999s)]
*  guys want and what happened in Acapulco. It's obviously pretty devastating. There's apparently [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4474.24s)]
*  no power lines standing in the entire region. Here's some photos. And you look at this like, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4478.4s)]
*  wow, 165 mile an hour sustained winds. The eye wall went through the town. A million people, [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4482.24s)]
*  by the way, many of whom live in not concrete reinforced buildings up against the mountain [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4488.4s)]
*  there. And so the devastation is really extraordinary. But the shocking thing is that [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4493.679999999999s)]
*  there was no prep. There was no warnings. There was no alerts. There were a ton of tourists [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4497.679999999999s)]
*  sitting in these hotels. Look at the, I don't know if you have any of the hotel photos, Nick, [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4501.92s)]
*  but it's insane. There are zero windows left in any of the hotels, any of the condos, any of the [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4505.679999999999s)]
*  resorts, they are gone. So imagine you're like in Acapulco, you're drinking beer and tequila, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4509.599999999999s)]
*  and then you go to sleep and this thing hits at 1 a.m. as a category five hurricane and destroys [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4516.08s)]
*  everything. There's no power. There's nothing. So if you pull up the first chart, most of the energy [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4522.799999999999s)]
*  that is absorbed from the sun ends up in our oceans. So we talk about atmospheric carbon [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4529.04s)]
*  increasing energy retention, and people can debate that all they want, where the carbon comes from, [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4534.799999999999s)]
*  et cetera, et cetera. At the end of the day, there is energy coming into the earth from the sun, [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4540.48s)]
*  and that energy is being retained. The vast majority of that energy is retained by the oceans. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4546.959999999999s)]
*  So the first couple of hundred meters of the oceans retain north of 90% of the energy absorbed [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4553.44s)]
*  by earth. If you go to the next slide, so that results in water temperatures going up. So if you [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4560.32s)]
*  look at this is compared to the 1955 to 2006 average, and you can measure ocean heat content, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4565.12s)]
*  but ocean heat content has risen fairly linearly since the 90s, and you can kind of see how much [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4571.84s)]
*  excess is correlated to temperature perfectly or no. So this is ocean temperatures over time. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4579.5199999999995s)]
*  So here you can see 2023. And so this shows you the average sea surface temperature. So 2023 [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4585.36s)]
*  has been such an outlier, and this is also because of these El Nino phenomena. But [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4592.88s)]
*  there's obviously over time, if you were to look at the average sea surface temperature trend, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4598.48s)]
*  it's rising linearly with heat content over time. And in particular in 2023, there's an extraordinary [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4602.4s)]
*  rise in temperature. So off the coast of Acapulco, the sea surface temperature was 88 degrees [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4607.76s)]
*  Fahrenheit. I mean, it was so hot, the water, like imagine an 88, that's like a David Sacks [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4612.639999999999s)]
*  swimming pool. It's so warm, going down many meters in the ocean. So when a storm goes over [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4617.2s)]
*  that level of heat, it takes heat out of the ocean. And that heat coming out of the ocean [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4623.599999999999s)]
*  increases the wind speed. And then the wind speed pulls more heat out of the ocean. And that's how [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4628.08s)]
*  these things become escalatory until they hit something cold, like a mountain or the land, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4632.08s)]
*  the land is much cooler. And then these things start to dissipate and break apart. And that's [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4637.599999999999s)]
*  why these things form over the ocean. So the point is no models predicted this. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4640.88s)]
*  And that's because we've never seen this level of energy stored in the oceans before. And the [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4647.2s)]
*  model training has never really accounted for this sort of extreme condition. This extreme [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4651.04s)]
*  condition obviously is what some folks are arguing is becoming more frequent. So it brings into [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4656.4s)]
*  question this ability for us to actually forecast the rise in the temperature over time is driving [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4661.36s)]
*  this. And then from an economic perspective, this is one of the key points I wanted to make. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4668.72s)]
*  When an event like this happens, there's a market called the reinsurance market. And the reinsurance [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4675.360000000001s)]
*  market sets the price for covering insurance companies against a big loss, where you can lose [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4680.96s)]
*  a ton of stuff at once. Insurance companies like to write insurance policies like car insurance is [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4686.64s)]
*  a great business, because there's never one big event that causes everyone to get in an accident [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4691.52s)]
*  on the same day. But with property insurance, a hurricane can cause everyone to lose on the same [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4695.6s)]
*  day. So insurance companies need to buy reinsurance. And then there's these big [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4700.72s)]
*  reinsurance companies and they have pools of capital and there's capital markets involved [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4704.64s)]
*  in bonds that are sold to protect reinsurance. So there's hundreds of billions of dollars, [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4708.0s)]
*  trillion dollar plus in reinsurance. When an event like this happens, those reinsurance markets take [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4713.84s)]
*  a loss. And the loss causes them to raise rates significantly. And when that happens, the reinsurance [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4719.12s)]
*  markets harden is what they say. And then rates go up next year for reinsurance. And then the [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4725.04s)]
*  insurance companies pass those rates on to consumers and to property developers and to the [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4730.4s)]
*  people that have mortgages. And the more of these events happen, even though it just happened in [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4735.2s)]
*  Acapulco, it impacts insurance rates everywhere. So as we see the events like what happened in Maui, [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4739.839999999999s)]
*  what happened in Acapulco, what happened in Miami, you can start to see more of these things start [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4745.839999999999s)]
*  to happen at the same time. The cost for insuring property goes up. And that starts to make this [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4750.16s)]
*  whole system very difficult to maintain because if the cost for insurance doubles or triples [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4755.84s)]
*  and people can't really afford it, but the mortgages require that they have it in all of [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4760.56s)]
*  these high risk coastal cities and coastal areas, that's where an economic hit either has to be [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4764.56s)]
*  absorbed by the federal government or we end up taking a massive or we can't get insurance, right? [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4768.8s)]
*  Or we take a massive economic loss. And so I just want to say like this seems like an outlier event [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4776.24s)]
*  and oh my gosh, we should be sorry and sad. But the truth is the frequency of these events and [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4780.88s)]
*  the risk factors, which is this ocean heat temperature rising continuously for a long [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4785.04s)]
*  period of time are going to drive that frequency of events. And there's going to be a real economic [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4789.04s)]
*  cost to bear on the order of several trillion dollars over time because someone has to underwrite [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4793.44s)]
*  that real estate and someone has to underwrite the insurance to support that real estate. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4798.8s)]
*  So it may seem like a one-off and oh, you know, this won't be a big deal, but it actually [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4802.24s)]
*  translates economically through the reinsurance and insurance markets into the real estate markets [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4805.76s)]
*  fairly quickly. And so I just wanted to kind of point out one of the second order consequences [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4809.6s)]
*  of this article in the wall street journal a few weeks ago, Nick, you can probably find it about [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4814.96s)]
*  this exact issue where they profiled the handful of homeowners. I think it was in Palm Beach or [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4820.08s)]
*  West Palm Beach and they essentially had to sell and leave because they couldn't afford the home [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4824.240000000001s)]
*  insurance or for those that own their home outright, they just stopped insuring it because [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4830.4800000000005s)]
*  they realized the land value would be fine. And so they said if a storm, there it is, if a storm [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4835.2s)]
*  Oh, there you go. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4841.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4842.32s)]
*  If a storm hits, you know, West Palm and destroys my home, you know, hopefully I'll be fine and then [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4842.64s)]
*  I'll just leave and I'll just sell it for the dirt. But to your point, it's become economically [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4848.72s)]
*  untenable in a lot of places for these folks to be able to ensure, ensure their home. Look at this, [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4854.96s)]
*  on this example, $121,000 a year for home insurance. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4859.36s)]
*  What? [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4864.16s)]
*  What? [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4864.88s)]
*  By the way, so add up the value. Well, that's because there's a one in 10 chance that [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4865.36s)]
*  a hurricane is going to hit them on any given year, right? And then they lose their whole value. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4870.96s)]
*  So do the math on what the total real estate value in that region is and think about what [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4874.24s)]
*  it gets written, gets written down to as everyone starts to sell. And then you do that across all [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4878.88s)]
*  these regions where there's now high risk and lack of insurance available. And you have a real [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4883.12s)]
*  economic question on who's going to step in to support and buoy those asset values. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4887.52s)]
*  Now, but aren't there state actors now that step in and act as a reinsurer? [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4892.32s)]
*  Great question. In Florida, they have a reinsurance pool that is largely assumed to [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4897.2s)]
*  be completely underfunded. And so everyone says like, Florida's got this reinsurance pool, [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4901.5199999999995s)]
*  they'll write your stuff. But Florida, if people, if you ask people in the reinsurance industry, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4905.5199999999995s)]
*  they're like, this thing's basically bankrupt. It's completely insolvent. This isn't real. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4909.5199999999995s)]
*  So the federal government's going to be asked to step in and cover that thing at some point. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4913.44s)]
*  And then someone's got to write a trillion dollar check. I mean, you know, you want to [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4917.44s)]
*  complain about sending 100 billion to Ukraine and Israel, wait until most of the country has [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4920.32s)]
*  to underwrite coastal communities, real estate values. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4924.08s)]
*  So Silicon Valley actually needs to be pro climate change so that you can reinflate the [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4926.64s)]
*  money supply. Wow. I mean, and then the other the other second order. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4932.320000000001s)]
*  I'm being facetious, but I'm kind of not. It's really crazy that so many industries, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4938.4800000000005s)]
*  it I think SAC said it really, really quite perfectly. When the money supply is shrinking, [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4943.4400000000005s)]
*  there's just a lot less money to go around. When the money supply is growing, it's much easier for [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4948.64s)]
*  all of us to grab a share of it. And now that it's shrinking, you have this weird effect where [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4952.72s)]
*  you actually want government intervention, which unfortunately only happens in acute tragedies and [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4957.360000000001s)]
*  calamities. And so what are we hoping for now as a society? That's a very scary idea. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4963.6s)]
*  The second one, in fact, is who's going to buy these homes if they can't be insured, right? [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4969.12s)]
*  Isn't that going to crash home prices for you, Berg? [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4972.64s)]
*  That's my point is that these assets aren't worth what they're currently marked at. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4974.56s)]
*  And if you add up all of the real estate assets in all of these different regions that, you know, [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4979.36s)]
*  everyone assumes are worth X. But the only reason they're worth X is because they're insured. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4985.28s)]
*  And if they're not insured, people are going to have to start to sell them. And if they can't [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4989.84s)]
*  afford the insurance, they're going to have to start some, then the real value starts to come out. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4992.4s)]
*  These sorts of events like Acapulco are catalyzing events for forcing the market to rewrite this. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=4995.599999999999s)]
*  Now, that's this is the beginning of a cascading effect. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5001.04s)]
*  I saw a really interesting study about the risk of the rising oceans and just the salinity of the [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5003.68s)]
*  oceans to all the real estate in Malibu. And the reason is that, you know, if you look at the [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5010.64s)]
*  Malibu coastline, there's a small number of homes, but they trade at an extreme amount of economic [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5014.8s)]
*  value. But what underpins all of that stuff are that these homes are viable, and that you can live [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5020.4800000000005s)]
*  in them and that you don't have to replace them and that if you can sufficiently drill far into [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5027.12s)]
*  the bedrock, you can keep these homes safe. And this study was just talking about how the [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5031.04s)]
*  corrosive effects of the ocean are such now that you can't actually do that to the same rate when [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5035.36s)]
*  you when you actually initially buy these homes. So now you have these $50 and $100 million homes [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5040.88s)]
*  that are really at risk of just corroding and falling into the sea. Interesting. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5046.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's always been an issue there. And you're right on the PCH highway, and there's a small [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5050.72s)]
*  amount of land between you and the water. So if it starts rising or it's corrosive, you know, [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5055.6s)]
*  I've rented those homes before friends of ours have as well. And the water just goes right underneath [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5060.160000000001s)]
*  the homes. And every year it goes a little bit further onto the home. Right. Yeah. And you can't [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5065.120000000001s)]
*  in some of the homes now, when they when they rent them to you for the summer, they say, hey, listen, [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5070.320000000001s)]
*  during high tides, you can't get to the beach safely, you can like jump off your back porch and [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5074.320000000001s)]
*  jump into a wave. But you know, low tide, you can get down and use the beach. If not, you have to [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5079.120000000001s)]
*  walk down the street and go down like, you know, another person's alley to get to the water. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5084.0s)]
*  Jay, where are you now? So I have been in the Middle East. I got to go to Riyadh for the first [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5087.44s)]
*  time and in UAE for the second time. I don't have any business interests here. But I have been taking [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5091.5199999999995s)]
*  a bunch of meetings. And the reason I went is I'm actually I'll pre announce it here, I'm going to [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5097.36s)]
*  be bringing this week in startups, I'm going to do a series from the Middle East and feature the [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5103.28s)]
*  capital allocators and the startups that are growing here at the startup scene here is [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5108.4s)]
*  extraordinary. And I'm going to bring my founder university to the region as well. And I'm going [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5112.16s)]
*  to start teaching entrepreneurs here in the region, Egypt, Saudi, UAE, Qatar, anybody, [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5116.8s)]
*  Jordan who wants to learn how to build a company, I'm going to be teaching startups in the region. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5124.320000000001s)]
*  And so pretty exciting. And I think startups, you know, at their core is hope and personal freedom [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5128.320000000001s)]
*  to change the world. And I think if we build deep relationships between these important countries [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5134.88s)]
*  that are playing a bigger and bigger role in the global stage, and we we build companies together, [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5140.4800000000005s)]
*  that's going to be great for American interests. So what I'm doing here since people have been [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5145.52s)]
*  asking you, what if anything has changed between what you thought of the Middle East versus what [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5149.92s)]
*  you think of it now? Has anything changed? Did you have a different view of Saudi? Let's take Saudi, [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5154.56s)]
*  for example, what did you think of Saudi and MBS before you went? And what do you think now after [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5159.280000000001s)]
*  you've been there? Well, there there was very little change in that society over the last 30 [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5163.120000000001s)]
*  or 40 years. And based on what they've told me, you know, spending a lot of time with a lot of [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5168.64s)]
*  people there, I maybe had, I don't know, 30 individual meetings, or coffees, dinners, [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5174.56s)]
*  literally 30 different people. And they've told me everything's changed. So personal freedoms [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5181.04s)]
*  have changed radically, economic freedoms have changed radically, the political system hasn't [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5187.120000000001s)]
*  changed. Nor do I think that's going to change radically. But yes, my opinion of it. The reality [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5192.0s)]
*  of it is it's changed massively. And then on top of that, yeah, I have learned a lot. I've never [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5197.44s)]
*  been there. The entrepreneurial excitement in the region, Saudi- Do you think you were too judgmental [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5205.28s)]
*  before? I have some core principles that I believe in. And what I will say is from doing this podcast [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5211.679999999999s)]
*  with the three of you, and then being thrust into like geopolitics, which, you know, I really haven't [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5219.2s)]
*  been in my life, I felt I needed to get more educated. I feel I am more educated now, [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5226.0s)]
*  after doing all these meetings. And I think the big education is the people here are not much [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5231.76s)]
*  different than the folks in our country. And they all want peace, prosperity, personal freedoms, [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5236.64s)]
*  they want to have a great life with their families. So to that extent, [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5244.32s)]
*  I think and each of the countries is very different, you know, and so you can't paint [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5248.72s)]
*  with a white brush. Now, of course, I know that. But there's no substitute for being here and [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5252.48s)]
*  spending time with people. So So do you think that you just had a misconception? Or do you think you [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5256.959999999999s)]
*  just fell for what the media tried to portray these countries when there were incidents? Like, [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5262.24s)]
*  how do you how do you reconcile that as you change your mind about them? Well, I think things have [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5268.799999999999s)]
*  actually changed here more than I've changed my mind. I still feel the same way I feel about human [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5274.48s)]
*  rights and, you know, personal freedoms and everything like that. But what I've learned is [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5278.96s)]
*  that this area is changing so quickly. And that change is hard. And David said something really [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5282.72s)]
*  important, you know, is like, you need strong people to make these changes here. And they're [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5288.56s)]
*  going to make the changes on their time. So the other thing, I think, if there's anything [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5292.72s)]
*  that has influenced me, it's probably what David said, you know, is like, this is going to be [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5297.6s)]
*  hard to make the changes here. And another thing you said, you know, there was one point you said [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5302.4s)]
*  on this pod, like, Hey, do you think they care what you think, right? They actually do care, [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5306.08s)]
*  they listen to the pod. But the truth is, the changes are going to occur here, Chamath, whether [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5310.72s)]
*  we're involved or not. And so I think as Americans, what we have to decide, and as business leaders, [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5315.12s)]
*  how involved do we want to be in that change? And how deep of those relationships do we want to build? [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5320.72s)]
*  Because if we don't build those relationships, there are other people who would like to forge [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5325.5199999999995s)]
*  relationships, right? Russia, China, etc. So I think just in terms of the chessboard that we see [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5329.36s)]
*  playing out right now, the more America can engage with this region, build companies with them, [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5336.88s)]
*  I think it's going to be better for humanity and society. And I think if you look at China, [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5343.679999999999s)]
*  we disengaged. And how's that going for us? Yeah, it's going terrible. So I want to build [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5347.599999999999s)]
*  companies here. And that's the other thing is people are having big talks about all of these [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5353.839999999999s)]
*  issues, human rights changes. And so I the thing I want to make sure people understand is, [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5357.28s)]
*  I want to see positive change in the world, including our country here everywhere. And so, [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5365.679999999999s)]
*  you know, it's never coming from a place of trying to be preachy to people, I just want to see [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5370.8s)]
*  positive change in the world. And you know, now with this podcast being so popular, people have [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5374.96s)]
*  expectations of us. And one of the expectations is we we know what we're talking about. And I [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5379.679999999999s)]
*  did not know what I was talking about in this region, because I never spent time here, just [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5385.52s)]
*  like Sax has never been to Ukraine, what does he know about Ukraine and Russia? He's never been to [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5388.160000000001s)]
*  either of those places. So you know, just like Sax is going to go to Russia and Ukraine and get [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5391.040000000001s)]
*  educated, you know, I came here to get educated so that I can represent the pod better. I've been [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5395.200000000001s)]
*  to the United States. And so I know that the US shouldn't be involved there. I'm joking with you, [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5399.360000000001s)]
*  my friend. I'm joking. But we you know, I think we should go, you know, do more travel. And it's [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5404.160000000001s)]
*  really inspiring to see what's going on here. On a very pragmatic basis, I will say, this is going [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5408.96s)]
*  to be the number two region in venture capital. And it's going to be that in 10 years, because I [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5414.72s)]
*  met with a lot of the family offices. And the family offices here are extraordinary. Like they [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5419.68s)]
*  built these businesses like really hard fought businesses 50 years ago. Welcome to being a [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5424.0s)]
*  capitalist, Jason, I love it. The water's warm in this bathtub. Join us. Well, no, the thing with [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5428.56s)]
*  these, these individuals is they're they're coming to the United States to invest in companies here. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5433.76s)]
*  They're not just like the dumb money at the table. Of course, they are. Of course, because they're [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5438.96s)]
*  smart business people. We're all smart business people. We've always wanted to be in business. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5442.4s)]
*  Nobody it's what you said nobody was sitting here wanting to be some preachy know it all. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5446.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So anyway, I'm learning a lot. I'm having a great time here. I don't have currently have any [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5451.04s)]
*  business interests here. But I would say, you know, a year from now, there'll be, you know, [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5454.879999999999s)]
*  a 12 episode run of this week in startups featuring folks here and then founding university [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5459.12s)]
*  to be here building companies with people in the region. So I'll be investing in some companies [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5463.04s)]
*  here and helping founders start companies. All right. Sax, I, [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5467.28s)]
*  Sacks Yeah, tell us about the speaker, Sax. Who is this lunatic? [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5471.84s)]
*  Sacks Well, let's not call him a lunatic because he's third in chart. He's third in line for the [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5475.12s)]
*  presidency. So Sax, who is he? Okay, his name is Mike Johnson. He's from Louisiana's fourth district. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5479.759999999999s)]
*  He's been in Congress for since 2016. It's his fourth term. He is in relative terms a backbencher. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5484.719999999999s)]
*  Apparently, he's never met with Mitch McConnell. That may be a good thing. But several members [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5491.44s)]
*  had to Google him to find out who he was. Really? Here we are. The good news in my view is that he [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5495.52s)]
*  did vote against more funding for Ukraine. However, as much as I like him on that issue, [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5502.64s)]
*  there are other issues where I think his previously stated views could be problematic [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5508.64s)]
*  for the Republican caucus. So he's very socially conservative. He voted to ban abortion at the [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5513.200000000001s)]
*  federal level. He's called gay marriage a dark harbinger of chaos and sexual anarchy [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5519.76s)]
*  that could doom even the strongest republic. On the issue of entitlements, he has expressed [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5526.72s)]
*  support for cutting Medicare and Social Security. I think Trump has rightly figured out that that [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5532.96s)]
*  would be death to the Republican party. Where he is aligned with Trump is that he bought into the [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5536.8s)]
*  election denial theories. And particularly, he bought into the Dominion scam that was pushed by [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5543.52s)]
*  Cindy Powell. Shout out Cindy Powell, who is pleaded guilty this week. Yeah, the crack in the [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5548.72s)]
*  crack. Yeah. So was lunatic too muted of a word to describe this guy? Shax, would you say or would [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5554.0s)]
*  I don't think he I wouldn't say David, David, how did he get elected? Because I thought there was [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5562.16s)]
*  like more moderates that were like embers and even Scalise is more to the left of this guy. So how, [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5566.16s)]
*  how did how does it that all of that ended up with the far far far right person getting elected? [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5573.52s)]
*  This is the crazy thing is that they had better choices. And so for example, Jim Jordan is the [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5579.4400000000005s)]
*  guy who I think should have gotten it. Jim Jordan is always supremely prepared for any hearing. He's [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5585.36s)]
*  one of the only Republicans who knows how to ask tough questions. I think he would have run the [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5591.04s)]
*  house with tremendous discipline. This is a case where you're plucking a guy out of obscurity. He [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5594.8s)]
*  may not even have the experience to run the house with the necessary discipline. Moreover, [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5599.52s)]
*  he's somebody who the Democrats are going to write campaign ads against very easily. Now, [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5605.6s)]
*  you asked the question, how did this happen? I think that the GOP just kind of ran out of gas. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5610.080000000001s)]
*  I mean, they went through so many candidates that they exhausted all the options and there were [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5614.56s)]
*  three weeks of chaos. And the New York Times summed up the feelings of the GOP caucus by saying, [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5620.4800000000005s)]
*  they view Johnson as someone who's sufficiently conservative, who they do not personally despise. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5625.76s)]
*  So that's really the reason at the end of the day is they just perceive him as a nice guy. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5630.400000000001s)]
*  But as you know, nice guys don't always get the job done. I think they were what is happening. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5635.76s)]
*  They kind of ran out of candidates and they chose this guy because he's a nice guy. Now, [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5641.04s)]
*  Jim Jordan, this guy's a nice guy. He's a nice guy. He's a nice guy. He believes gay people are [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5646.08s)]
*  evil. I don't I certainly don't approve of that message, but it comes from his religious views. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5651.84s)]
*  Well done, Republican Party. But look, Jim Jordan was the right guy here, but Jim Jordan [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5658.56s)]
*  sometimes has sharp elbows. And so he's rubbed people the wrong way. Mike Johnson, on a personal [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5663.360000000001s)]
*  level, has not rubbed people the wrong way. But I agree that the campaign ads are going to write [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5669.12s)]
*  themselves here. He apparently hasn't rubbed anybody. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5676.0s)]
*  And then the crazy thing is that the one social issue gets crazier. Well, from my point of view, [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5683.04s)]
*  the one social issue or cultural issue where he's not that conservative apparently is on [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5688.72s)]
*  CRT. He said a bunch of things that indicate that he views the US as being systemically [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5694.0s)]
*  racist and doesn't think Republicans should be attacking CRT, which I think is the one cultural [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5700.48s)]
*  issue where Republicans should be on offense. They should be opposing the woke mind virus. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5707.599999999999s)]
*  I would like to see them go after that issue and not be trying to re-litigate gay marriage or [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5712.879999999999s)]
*  abortion at the federal level. So in my view, this guy is the wrong mix of cultural issues. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5718.879999999999s)]
*  And then, of course, his views on entitlements are a surefire loser for the Republicans. So [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5724.959999999999s)]
*  the Republicans are all slapping each other's backs and sucking each other's [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5729.6s)]
*  asses over getting this done. They're also happy about it. But I think it's a disaster in the making. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5734.0s)]
*  It's a disaster. How long does this last? How many days? How many moochies, [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5741.52s)]
*  how many sacramoches does this guy last? Yeah. You give him seven? [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5746.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, again, the Republicans now are so burned by the chaos that just went through that I don't [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5751.68s)]
*  think they want to go back into it too easily. Wow. So it could last. Look, you're right. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5756.8s)]
*  I don't think he's going to last long term, but it may be more than a few scaramoochies. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5764.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Scaramoochie only lasts 11 days. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. 100 days? [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5769.92s)]
*  A scaramoochie is a unit that equals 11 days. Yes. So you think like 10 scaramoochies? [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5775.92s)]
*  No, but you could get to, if you have to get to like January 20th of 2025, which is the inauguration, [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5782.5599999999995s)]
*  what are you talking about? 365 days, right? Plus another 90 days. We're talking like 70 scaramoochies [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5788.32s)]
*  here. No, we're talking about 41 scaramoochies to get to January 20th. I mean, 40 scaramoochies in [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5795.36s)]
*  a wake up. Of 2025. 40 in a wake up. Oh my Lord. So what you're going to see is now that the media, [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5802.4s)]
*  this is already started. There's going to be a drip, drip, drip of all the things that he's ever [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5809.68s)]
*  said when he was kind of a backbencher and no one was paying attention. All these sermons that he's [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5814.240000000001s)]
*  given and so forth, they're going to be writing stories about that and they're going to make the [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5819.4400000000005s)]
*  guy seem like a wacko. Or expose that he is a wacko. I mean, well, I think that I would say [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5824.240000000001s)]
*  that he's just somebody who's got very socially conservative views based on being an evangelical [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5831.04s)]
*  and- Might be wildly out of touch with Americans, yeah. I don't want to offend [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5836.64s)]
*  people in that group by saying he's a wacko, but I think you are right that it is not [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5842.88s)]
*  in tune with most voters. Let's say that. Hey, before we go, Sax, I got to ask you about the [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5847.76s)]
*  Trump cases. I mean, as a lawyer, what do you think is going to happen here? We have all of the crack [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5855.92s)]
*  in people- Explain to the audience what happened. Well, I mean, I think everybody's following it. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5862.56s)]
*  Jenna Alice, Kenneth Chesbrough, it's spelled cheese bro, but it's Chesbrough, and Sidney Powell [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5866.88s)]
*  have all now pleaded guilty, some of them for felonies in fact, but the others misdemeanors. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5873.200000000001s)]
*  They're all really apologetic about basically this fake electorates scam they were running to [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5880.160000000001s)]
*  try to overturn the election. They say there are six more of these 19 people in the Rico case who [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5886.88s)]
*  are going to flip next week. At the same time, Trump was doing his case in New York and was fined [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5892.32s)]
*  10K for violating the gag order the second time. Third time, they think he's going to actually [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5898.88s)]
*  potentially be put in jail, which seems to be something he's trying to do. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5904.719999999999s)]
*  So what's your take here, Sax? Is it all a deep state conspiracy still, January 6th up, [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5911.04s)]
*  or were these lunatics actually trying to overthrow the government? To be honest, when you [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5916.719999999999s)]
*  mentioned the name Jenna Alice, all I can really think of is that election hearing in Michigan, [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5920.4s)]
*  where she made a face because Rudy Giuliani audibly farted. And then it turned out that [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5925.599999999999s)]
*  she got COVID a few days later, and we think that Giuliani had it at the hearing. So he may have [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5934.4s)]
*  farted the COVID into her. That's what we've learned after all of this with COVID is that it's [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5938.96s)]
*  not it's actually is airborne. It's just flatulent space. You could you could fart COVID onto somebody. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5943.12s)]
*  Can you fart COVID into somebody's face? [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5956.5599999999995s)]
*  Can it come out your bum as well as your mouth? Come on, should we have put masks or diapers when [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5963.68s)]
*  we were on airplanes to block the COVID from we should have masked and we were masking the [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5968.88s)]
*  wrong place? Yes, Friedberg? I got him to smile. He almost left. Hold on, put this on the screen. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5973.68s)]
*  Yeah. But hold on. She says she says the TLTR is unlikely, but that's not a no. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5981.2s)]
*  It's not a no. That's all the same as impossible. Yeah. I mean, can we get Fauci to come back? [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=5993.68s)]
*  Anthony Fauci, he's got the answer for us. In all seriousness, this is they're going to flip all [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=6002.4s)]
*  these folks. I mean, this is like the end of Goodfellas here. Everybody's getting pinched. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=6008.24s)]
*  What do you think? How does this end, Zach? I think what's likely happening is that they're [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=6016.64s)]
*  flipping these lower level figures in order to flip the next higher level, which would be [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=6022.56s)]
*  Giuliani and John Eastman, because I don't think these people have anything on Trump. So they're [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=6027.92s)]
*  going to try and use Jenna Ellis to flip Rudy. And then they're going to try and see if Rudy [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=6033.120000000001s)]
*  will flip on Trump. But this all begs the question of like, was there ever a crime here? [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=6039.6s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, they admit. Yeah. Who's admitted to it? [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=6046.160000000001s)]
*  The three people who pleaded guilty and the court. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=6051.68s)]
*  Sure, because they don't want to have their lives ruined by spending their lives in criminal [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=6054.64s)]
*  prosecutions that could send them to jail. So obviously, they're going to cut a deal. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=6058.72s)]
*  But that doesn't necessarily mean that like they're going to get the big guy here on some crime. And [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=6062.56s)]
*  in fact, I remember when the TDS crowd was orgasmic over Trump's CFO flipping. Remember when [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imwAJ0XcqQ&t=6067.76s)]
