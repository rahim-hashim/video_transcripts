**All In Podcast:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw)
*  Alright, everybody, welcome back to the all in podcast, the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=0.0s)]
*  number one, finance, technology, business, and [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2.96s)]
*  MAGA podcast in the world. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=7.96s)]
*  Today is the Sultan of Science, David Freberg, living a modern [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=11.52s)]
*  1950s aesthetic lifestyle there. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=18.56s)]
*  This is the house of tomorrow, house of the future. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=21.28s)]
*  World's fair. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=25.2s)]
*  The original 1955 Tomorrowland at Disneyland. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=25.84s)]
*  Well, and you have a NASA hat on. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=30.0s)]
*  This is amazing. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=31.6s)]
*  He's in full geek out mode. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=32.56s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't listen. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=34.52s)]
*  I told you guys about this haircut last week. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=35.64s)]
*  You couldn't blow yourself. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=38.2s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=40.28s)]
*  Properly. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=41.0s)]
*  I told you this would happen to you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  It's exactly what your mom said would happen. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  Look at the continuity. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=46.24s)]
*  He told you, you could never match the blow you got last week. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  And here we are. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=50.84s)]
*  I did my best. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it looks ridiculous, but stylish in a way. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=53.36s)]
*  And with us again, your chairman dictator Chamath Palihapitiya. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=56.16s)]
*  He's ready to go to the inauguration and take his victory [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=60.68s)]
*  lap and take an enormous amount of credit. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=65.4s)]
*  Chamath, are you looking forward to your victory lap? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=68.52s)]
*  I was in Florida earlier this week. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=72.36s)]
*  I came all the way back so that I could play poker with my friends [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=75.12s)]
*  and see my family and children. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=78.2s)]
*  And I'll be flying all the way back out tomorrow morning. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=80.56s)]
*  Were you at Mar-a-Lago? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=82.84s)]
*  No, I was with my friend in an undisclosed location. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=84.8s)]
*  With a friend in an undisclosed location. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  Sounds great. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  And joining us for the first time, one of my oldest friends, Mr. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=92.4s)]
*  Mark Pincus, or as we like to say, Marcus Pincus. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=98.56s)]
*  Why do you always take credit for these guests being only your friends? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  The rest of us are the ones that call them and are like, Hey, do you want [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=106.04s)]
*  to come on the show? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=108.4s)]
*  And then you're like, hi, my old Pincus longer than you. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=109.0s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=112.08s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  Back to like AOL? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=114.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=115.55999999999999s)]
*  Well, we met when you were doing Silicon Alley, right? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=116.72s)]
*  Reporter, yeah. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  I've been collecting rent from Mark Pincus for the last year. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  That's true. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  My landlord. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  You should whistle blow on Freeberg to Gavin's gouging police and see if [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=126.52s)]
*  you can get something out of that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=131.0s)]
*  And it said we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=142.04s)]
*  We'll get right to that in a minute. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=150.32s)]
*  The price couch continues. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  If our viewers had to vote on who is most likely to price gouge, it's a [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  hundred percent Freeberg. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  Thousand percent. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=158.24s)]
*  But let's be clear. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=159.12s)]
*  The real gouging is the Presidio Trust, who's charging an amazingly high rent, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=160.04s)]
*  like over a hundred dollars a foot. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=165.6s)]
*  And then Freeberg was actually giving me a pretty good deal. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=167.32s)]
*  He was getting a pretty good deal. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=170.72s)]
*  I was paying like 130 a foot or something. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  120, 130 a foot all in for real estate and the Presidio. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=174.11999999999998s)]
*  And we just weren't using the space, but it is the most expensive real estate. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=178.64s)]
*  It is nuts. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=181.6s)]
*  That is quite an office, man. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=182.28s)]
*  Lord. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=183.83999999999997s)]
*  The Presidio Trust manages that federal land and they get to keep all the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=184.32s)]
*  money and reinvest it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  It's probably the only profitable operation in the federal government. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=189.6s)]
*  I used to be on the board, so I saw it close up and they reinvest in things [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=193.28s)]
*  like, you know, restoring natural habitats, cutting down eucalyptus trees, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=198.28s)]
*  right? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=203.56s)]
*  You know, archaeological digs. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=203.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=206.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=207.48s)]
*  It was really interesting. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=208.0s)]
*  I looked at one of those houses to rent when I was first moving up to San [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  Francisco and the only problem with those houses had these gorgeous houses that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=214.6s)]
*  were like the generals houses, like three, four or five bedrooms, but they would [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=219.0s)]
*  have one bathroom for four rooms. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=223.08s)]
*  And I can you put another bathroom and cannot change anything. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=226.68s)]
*  These are historic privileges. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=229.56s)]
*  So, you know, historic landmarks, marked it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=230.8s)]
*  Freeloader tribe social network back in the day, support.com. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=235.16s)]
*  And if you wasted some portion of your youth playing Farmville, he was one of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  the original app creators or Zynga poker, which famously he said, Hey, would you [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=245.12s)]
*  like to be an investor in Zynga poker? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=250.92s)]
*  And I said, how does it work? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=252.48s)]
*  He said, Oh, well, you play for virtual coins. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=253.48s)]
*  And I said, Mark, this is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=255.6s)]
*  You've taken all of the money out of the game. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=258.36s)]
*  It's never going to work. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=263.2s)]
*  And of course he turned it into a multi-billion dollar company. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=264.6s)]
*  And that was another $25 million angel investment miss on my part. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=266.88s)]
*  But Mark, you were also like early general social networking. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=270.8s)]
*  You were involved in Facebook as an investor, LinkedIn, weren't you? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=274.4s)]
*  Like, yeah, I, I think the first social media investment I made was Napster. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=278.28s)]
*  I sent the first check, the first hundred thousand dollars. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  I think of that as the beginning of all this, but then yeah, Reed and I put up [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  the first money for Friendster and then we were lucky enough to invest along with [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=292.24s)]
*  Peter in the first round of Facebook. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=298.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=301.0s)]
*  The first round of Twitter. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=301.88s)]
*  So. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=303.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=304.32s)]
*  Pick the right body of water, even if your boat doesn't tribe didn't work. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=305.24s)]
*  But, but you place five other bets. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=310.56s)]
*  So you hit a couple of them. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=312.36s)]
*  Works out just fine. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=314.11999999999995s)]
*  You also owned, I believe you own the six degrees patents. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=315.64s)]
*  The original social network in the nineties in web 1.0 was a company called six [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  degrees and they had a bunch of patents and I believe you bought them and then [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=326.91999999999996s)]
*  sold them to Facebook. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=331.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=332.35999999999996s)]
*  No, we didn't sell them. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=333.2s)]
*  Reed and I bought them because we were worried that if Yahoo at the time had [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=334.23999999999995s)]
*  gotten them or even Friendster that they would have blocked the whole industry. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=340.24s)]
*  So we bought them. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=344.68s)]
*  We, we paid 750 K, which was a lot then, and we were accused of being patent [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=346.04s)]
*  trolls and we never got that opportunity. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=352.0s)]
*  We just sat on them to this day. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=355.92s)]
*  Actually I own half and Microsoft owns the other half. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=358.88s)]
*  Are you still close with Reed, Mark? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=362.04s)]
*  Yeah, very close. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=364.8s)]
*  How did you guys reconcile your differences in political views in this last election? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=366.72s)]
*  Cause he was very vocal, Kamala. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=371.88s)]
*  You obviously became vocal Trump and very kind of, kind of diametrically [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=373.6s)]
*  different views on the future. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=379.48s)]
*  Well, it's interesting cause Reed and I really started the whole kind of journey [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=382.84000000000003s)]
*  into bigger national politics together. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=387.20000000000005s)]
*  We both sat down and had lunch with Biden and made, wrote big checks a little over a [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=390.6s)]
*  year ago, December of 23. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=397.20000000000005s)]
*  And, and then, you know, it won't bother you, but I, I had my red pill moment and I [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=400.6s)]
*  went a very different direction, which started off just questioning the Democrats. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=405.56s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=410.56s)]
*  Can you actually just double click into that? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=411.40000000000003s)]
*  What was your red pill moment? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=413.16s)]
*  Was there one specific thing or was it more of a trickle of things? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=415.36s)]
*  It was both, right? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=418.40000000000003s)]
*  It's like it starts, the wall starts crumbling and then it comes down all at once. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=419.36s)]
*  So for me, it really started early in 23, I started reading Pirate Wires and Mike [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=422.96000000000004s)]
*  Solana and I thought he was a little crazy at first cause he would write these articles. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=431.76s)]
*  One he wrote was about how the Ukrainian soldiers had swastikas on their helmets and [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=436.88s)]
*  the New York Times photographers would ask them to take the swastikas off for photos. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=442.72s)]
*  And I said, that can't be right. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=447.6s)]
*  That can't be true. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=448.88s)]
*  And then four months later, it was in the New York Times, buried in the middle of the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  paper, and I kept seeing stories like that, that, that he would be early on. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=453.96s)]
*  And so I just started feeling uncomfortable and queasy about what was going on with [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=459.71999999999997s)]
*  mainstream media. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=464.2s)]
*  And then in May of last year of 24, I read some article that talked about Trump's [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=465.68s)]
*  speech in Charlottesville and this has been well covered, but, but where he said there [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=473.2s)]
*  was good people on both sides. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=478.4s)]
*  And the article said it was completely, you know, propaganda and not what he actually, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=480.15999999999997s)]
*  not accurately reflecting what he said, that, that he denounced the Nazis a bunch of [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=487.23999999999995s)]
*  times in his speech. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=492.67999999999995s)]
*  And so then I went and watched that video and that was my red pill moment. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=494.32s)]
*  I think it was for a lot of people because it wasn't just the media spinning it or [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=498.76s)]
*  politicians spinning it. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=504.56s)]
*  That was like one of the pillars of why you were supposed to hate Trump was that [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=505.91999999999996s)]
*  speech. And, and then you see. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=510.84s)]
*  Biden say that's why he had to run a second time. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=515.16s)]
*  And you see Obama go to even see Biden bring it up again in the beginning of the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=518.56s)]
*  DNC, and it's one of their pillars and they clearly know that they're [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=522.88s)]
*  misrepresenting things. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=527.0s)]
*  So for me, that was just. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=528.0799999999999s)]
*  That was beyond uncomfortable. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=531.16s)]
*  I was just like, OK, now I got to go back to first principles and look at the primary [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=532.48s)]
*  data and listen only to original speeches by people. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=537.2s)]
*  And I just realized I couldn't trust mainstream media. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=540.32s)]
*  So I became I started questioning the Democrats. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=544.08s)]
*  As soon as I started questioning the Democrats, I started getting a lot of shame [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=547.0400000000001s)]
*  and anger and hatred. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=552.72s)]
*  Oh, the other thing that happened, that was part of this journey is that my chief of [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=554.24s)]
*  staff. Part of ways with me after nine years in April of last year, and he was the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=557.4s)]
*  main person protecting me from myself on Twitter, and he was the one who would say, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=564.0s)]
*  stay in your lane. Nobody wants to hear what you think about politics or San [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=568.52s)]
*  Francisco or anything other than your area of products and investing. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=572.04s)]
*  And with him gone, I just started tweeting whatever I felt and thought. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=577.36s)]
*  And sometimes I got it wrong or it was a little too emotional. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=581.5600000000001s)]
*  But first of all, it was really fun. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=585.36s)]
*  And then second of all, I found I got connected to this whole new audience of people [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=587.28s)]
*  who are these kind of techno optimists. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=593.48s)]
*  I think you guys probably talked about it. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=595.48s)]
*  And that just brought me down this path that eventually I came out two days before [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=598.28s)]
*  the election. Publicly for Trump, it was only because that's when I completely got [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=605.96s)]
*  there. And I was trying to just be completely honest and authentic with myself and on [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=613.6s)]
*  Twitter at the same time. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=619.44s)]
*  And my daughters turned to me that Sunday and they said, you're you're going to vote [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=621.88s)]
*  for Trump. We know it. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=626.9200000000001s)]
*  And I said, yeah, you're probably right. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=627.96s)]
*  And they said, well, then you have to go say it on Twitter. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=629.44s)]
*  And my daughters like really in this with me. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=631.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So anyway, it was on the front page of the New York Post on the day of the [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=634.4s)]
*  election that I was this not that I'm such news, but maybe it just was their news [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=639.68s)]
*  peg that I was coming out for Trump. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=646.3599999999999s)]
*  And but I'll get back to your read question. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=649.52s)]
*  But what I love about my New York Times about my New York friends is that they did not [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=652.68s)]
*  give a f**k. They were all pro-Kamala and they texted me and they're just like, oh, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=658.8s)]
*  that's kind of funny. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=664.4799999999999s)]
*  But it's one thing I kind of love about New York. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=665.9599999999999s)]
*  They didn't care. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=667.9599999999999s)]
*  Back to your question on read. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=668.92s)]
*  What I love about read was he was already getting pings from people saying, what's [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=671.8s)]
*  going on with pink is he's going off the rails. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=676.76s)]
*  He's becoming a Trumper. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=679.2399999999999s)]
*  You know, it's you guys, I'm sure, have gone down a little bit of that to your mom. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=681.04s)]
*  And Brie Berg. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=686.2399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Me like, what's wrong with him? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=688.2399999999999s)]
*  We got to bring him back into the fold. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=690.52s)]
*  You know, he's he's should we lock him up? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=692.56s)]
*  Is he crazy? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=695.1199999999999s)]
*  And so Reed was already getting these. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=696.76s)]
*  I had a lot of anxiety about talking to Reed about it. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=698.8s)]
*  And finally, Reed and I got on FaceTime and he just said, I just want to start by [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=702.4399999999999s)]
*  saying, I'm team Mark. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=709.8s)]
*  And I said, I'm team Reed. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=711.56s)]
*  And it gets out a little, you know. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=713.4s)]
*  Aw. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=714.4399999999999s)]
*  Aw. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=715.36s)]
*  But Americans can get along even if they disagree politically about candidates, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=716.08s)]
*  probably where we need to get to, especially, you know, now that Trump's going to be in [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=720.44s)]
*  office in a couple of days. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=724.32s)]
*  What was it like when you had lunch with Biden? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=726.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=728.5200000000001s)]
*  OK. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=729.0400000000001s)]
*  Well, just to finish the read part. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=729.44s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=730.96s)]
*  But what I love about Reed is that we followed that with a four hour dinner. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=731.84s)]
*  And he said, I never questioned your principles. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=737.5200000000001s)]
*  He said, I know you're a highly principled person and I just want to understand which [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=741.84s)]
*  principles it is. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=746.72s)]
*  And I'd like to convince you to change your mind. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=748.2800000000001s)]
*  But anyway, so. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=750.1600000000001s)]
*  Can I? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=751.4000000000001s)]
*  Hold on one second. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=751.8000000000001s)]
*  So. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=753.24s)]
*  I. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=755.36s)]
*  You said something almost in passing, but I just want to double click. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=756.32s)]
*  I think part of what Silicon Valley actually gets wrong is that we don't embrace the [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=761.24s)]
*  tism. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=768.4000000000001s)]
*  And what I mean by that is everybody, we're all a little socially uncomfortable. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=769.36s)]
*  We're awkward. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=774.52s)]
*  I wouldn't say that we were the coolest people growing up. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=775.88s)]
*  And there is this virulent form of blockers. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=778.64s)]
*  You called it chief of staff. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=782.92s)]
*  I think that these folks can be very detrimental, which almost represent this [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=785.4s)]
*  filter between your true self and everybody else. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=791.8s)]
*  And there is this game that's played about being a gatekeeper. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=795.04s)]
*  I do think that executive assistants are valuable. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=800.4s)]
*  Administrative assistants are valuable. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=803.6s)]
*  The reason I can say this is that my EA went on maternity leave. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=806.16s)]
*  I had, and I experimented with the chief of staff, et cetera. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=811.4s)]
*  And now I use Jason's service called Athena. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=814.0s)]
*  And I have a guy that works with me in the Philippines and it's about 3000 a month. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=817.28s)]
*  And I can honestly tell you this guy is the single most effective administrative [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=824.72s)]
*  support I've ever had. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=829.28s)]
*  And what there isn't is all these opinions on what I can say or do. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=831.28s)]
*  And I think that when you look at a lot of these big companies, if you look at [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=836.52s)]
*  Zuck's current transformation or what you just spoke about, there are all these [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=839.28s)]
*  interlopers that seem to get in the middle of you and people's perception of you. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=843.04s)]
*  I don't know if you have any comments or reactions to that idea. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=849.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=852.64s)]
*  It's part of where I know you guys have talked about Zuck coming out as Lisa's [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=852.96s)]
*  based or his seemingly more authentic self or sharing more about himself. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=858.0s)]
*  And I can relate to it because I think we all go through this, this struggle as [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=863.16s)]
*  you start to be more of a known person inside your company, outside your company. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=870.92s)]
*  And you have people around you taking the edges off. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=877.0799999999999s)]
*  And I think that we're now in this time that I think we're having authenticity is [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=881.7199999999999s)]
*  having a moment now, which is great for me because Reed said to me, I've, if you [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=888.16s)]
*  Google me, you'll see that there's lots and lots of bad things written about me. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=894.68s)]
*  And a lot of it is my high school quote was some people have tact and others tell [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=899.12s)]
*  the truth. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=904.28s)]
*  And I've always been kind of just committed to being honest, even if it's [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=905.0s)]
*  nuanced and it's not an easy soundbite. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=910.48s)]
*  And Reed said to me early on, you need to pick what the easy narrative is. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=912.68s)]
*  Or the press is going to make it up for you. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=918.04s)]
*  And he was right. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=920.4399999999999s)]
*  And they did, or my competitors did. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=921.4799999999999s)]
*  So I think that now with long form podcasts and there's just more and the [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=923.3199999999999s)]
*  fact that we can kind of directly, in a lot of ways, Elon was the first one to [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=931.28s)]
*  directly defend himself. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=935.4s)]
*  You remember when he fired his whole, do you remember when he fired his whole PR [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=936.64s)]
*  team? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=940.2399999999999s)]
*  He fired all those people. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=940.9599999999999s)]
*  There's just like, there's none of that infrastructure between him and, and [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=942.16s)]
*  everybody else. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=946.04s)]
*  But do you remember when he would be on Twitter all the time, post PayPal, trying [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=947.0799999999999s)]
*  to correct the story and just write long, long diatribes. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=951.7199999999999s)]
*  And then, and then when a New York Times reporter said something negative out of [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=956.52s)]
*  Tesla, he just went off for weeks about them. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=960.28s)]
*  And, and it seemed a little crazy and deranged. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=963.76s)]
*  And then you started to see that it worked. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=966.5999999999999s)]
*  Like he actually, and we were told, don't defend yourself. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=968.24s)]
*  If something bad is written about you, you're going to prolong the press cycle. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=971.8399999999999s)]
*  You're going to make the journalists angry. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=975.88s)]
*  And so we've, we're now on shackled. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=980.1199999999999s)]
*  I teach this class at Stanford and I taught two back to back on Monday and I [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=982.4799999999999s)]
*  looked around and I saw half the placards said, you know, she, her, you know, he, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=987.1999999999999s)]
*  him, his, and I got a little pang of like, Oh, do I have to watch what I'm saying? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=993.0799999999999s)]
*  Like, no, I don't. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=997.5999999999999s)]
*  I'm on shackled. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=998.88s)]
*  I'm just going to, this is just me and I'm going to be Mark unfiltered. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1000.16s)]
*  And it's the better version of ourselves. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1005.32s)]
*  So anyway, I, I'm glad that Zuck feels like he can be, he can present more of [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1006.68s)]
*  his complete self out there now. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1012.68s)]
*  And I think we can get into it later, but I have a lot of thoughts on how the [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1015.76s)]
*  culture is going to kind of move more towards base. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1020.36s)]
*  Back to the other question with Biden, that lunch you had, did he seem [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1023.0s)]
*  like he was all there? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1028.52s)]
*  Come on. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1029.8s)]
*  Yeah, come on more. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1030.4s)]
*  Was it in the afternoon? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1031.12s)]
*  I mean, did you have concerns about that? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1032.4s)]
*  Cause that was, that was a sharp as a tack. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1033.72s)]
*  Well, that was a big network. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1035.88s)]
*  As a tech. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1036.84s)]
*  Me. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1037.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, I'm not saying I'm like full mag over here, but wait a second. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1037.76s)]
*  Are you guys lying about this? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1041.88s)]
*  Like how long is this and how deep is this coverup? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1043.44s)]
*  I have no horse in this race. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1046.6000000000001s)]
*  I didn't have a horse in the race, so I had nothing to lie about. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1048.08s)]
*  I for sure don't now. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1051.96s)]
*  I'm really not a Biden fan or protector. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1053.56s)]
*  I'll tell you. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1058.1200000000001s)]
*  Like the exact, my exact observation. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1059.68s)]
*  We, we had this lunch. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1062.84s)]
*  There was like maybe five of us with Biden and a few of his finance people in, they [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1065.2s)]
*  had it in the tennis house, which is the way they found that they can have a [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1070.8s)]
*  fundraising lunch on the property of the white house. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1075.72s)]
*  They found some way. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1078.32s)]
*  We'll see if, if Trump doesn't. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1079.92s)]
*  Yeah, the loophole. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1082.2s)]
*  And, and it was, I was impressed. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1083.48s)]
*  It was a long lunch. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1085.1200000000001s)]
*  It must've been hour and a half, two hours. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1086.32s)]
*  And I'll tell you the good and the bad. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1088.72s)]
*  The good, the part I was impressed was. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1090.48s)]
*  He kept the conversation thread. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1094.4s)]
*  He was engaged and kept the thread the whole time. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1096.28s)]
*  When people, we say sharp as a tack or kept the thread. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1099.72s)]
*  That's how we talk about like our 90 year old grandparent or something. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1103.88s)]
*  So I'm just saying the reality to me, he, he was not. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1108.16s)]
*  He did not seem mentally debilitated in the sense of dementia, but we were [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1112.28s)]
*  impressed that he was able to follow the conversation thread and then say, you [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1120.48s)]
*  know, okay, let me say it differently. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1126.04s)]
*  Would you have had the same bar if it was Jamie diamond sitting across [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1128.76s)]
*  from you for two hour lunch? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1133.48s)]
*  No, no. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1135.9199999999998s)]
*  So, so, so yes, it was, it was, wow. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1137.04s)]
*  Your grandfather is holding up really well. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1140.0s)]
*  Like your grandfather was able to have a whole lunch and hold the conversation. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1142.68s)]
*  But it wasn't, I didn't walk away saying, I have to admit, I did not walk away [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1148.2s)]
*  saying, I think he's mentally unfit, but I did, but, and I wasn't shocked, but I [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1153.16s)]
*  was like, okay, this is someone who's being really handled and managed by [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1158.76s)]
*  the people around him and he's being told to show up here, say this, but he [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1163.04s)]
*  was, he was not on an obvious script, which I know I think famously he did [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1168.64s)]
*  some fundraiser at the nodes house where he was reading a prompter the whole time. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1173.68s)]
*  So wasn't reading a prompter. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1178.2800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1181.72s)]
*  And I had a person's home. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1181.96s)]
*  They brought a teleprompter for him to speak. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1184.6000000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1186.48s)]
*  That's weird. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1187.0s)]
*  I didn't actually, that's no information. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1188.3200000000002s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1190.16s)]
*  But I mean, in fairness, like the, um, there's this issue called teleprompter. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1191.6000000000001s)]
*  There's this issue called sundowning people who are in that age group. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1197.92s)]
*  They're good in the day. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1201.96s)]
*  And then the sun goes down and you know, their brains are exhausted and that's [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1203.1200000000001s)]
*  when you would see it. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1209.0s)]
*  And that's what they said about the debate. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1210.0800000000002s)]
*  But for me, that was the, the coronation of Kamala and like not actually having [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1211.72s)]
*  a speed run primary that to me was just. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1216.04s)]
*  Anti-democratic, anti-American and like just what happened to merit and [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1219.16s)]
*  like having a process here, right? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1223.8400000000001s)]
*  That's when I felt like the party just collapsed on itself. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1226.12s)]
*  I'm glad you're, let's jump in. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1229.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1231.08s)]
*  But let me ask you a question before we get into the doc. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1231.56s)]
*  And we've got a lot to talk about obviously, but what do you think the [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1233.36s)]
*  democratic party does from here? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1236.24s)]
*  Like is it, everybody's like this, they're lost in a drift. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1238.28s)]
*  We're not even hearing from them. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1241.32s)]
*  Maybe a little bit of a pushback, I guess, at these. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1244.0s)]
*  Senate hearings right now for confirmations, but what do you think happens? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1248.68s)]
*  Is there any hope for this and who would lead them out of this? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1252.88s)]
*  Shapiro, somebody AOC? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1256.6000000000001s)]
*  I think that what my brain, like kind of intelligent front of brain would tell me [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1260.0800000000002s)]
*  the logical thing, which I think I want to say is one lens that I think we have [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1266.88s)]
*  to be careful not to just apply logic here because it's parties and, and the [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1272.2s)]
*  Democrats, but the logic would say, Oh, they're going to find based authentic [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1276.4s)]
*  people to put up against these other ones, like the kind of Federman types that [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1281.96s)]
*  they're going to put those people forth who are more centrist and also are more [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1288.2s)]
*  trustworthy that they're actually authentic in their flaws. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1294.52s)]
*  That's what my brain would tell me. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1298.0800000000002s)]
*  I think there'll be a little of that, that the party I believe will move more that way. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1300.04s)]
*  I think that the corporate candidates aren't going to fly anymore with the electorate. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1305.96s)]
*  I think that the managed corporate through soundbites can't do a long form, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1311.24s)]
*  things like this. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1317.56s)]
*  I think that's over and we can get into that later if we want, but I think they [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1318.9199999999998s)]
*  won't go as far as they should. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1325.6799999999998s)]
*  So, so they, they won't go as far as like what I think we would intelligently [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1327.24s)]
*  advise them to do. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1332.12s)]
*  So I, so that's as much as I can figure out that they should do that, but they [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1333.4399999999998s)]
*  won't. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1338.36s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1339.28s)]
*  Well, we're certainly going to find out in the next year or two what their direction [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1340.32s)]
*  is when they get to the midterms, I suppose. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1344.12s)]
*  Oh, one more thing though on it is, a lot of it depends on really what we see. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1347.24s)]
*  And if, if Doge starts to really get popular support, this whole, I think you guys [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1353.12s)]
*  talked about this last week, that the more that FDR style Trump and people get popular [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1358.4s)]
*  support, it's going to become a more and more isolating, lonely place in two years [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1364.84s)]
*  to still be like, you know, California, Gavin, everyone's saying, don't worry, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1371.36s)]
*  we're going to protect you against these people. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1376.72s)]
*  If, if they're doing things that are popular to still saying you're protecting [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1378.8s)]
*  against them, I think will won't fly. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1382.76s)]
*  Well, that's a great jump off point because Gavin does seem and Karen Bass [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1385.2s)]
*  seem like their careers are ending and they're in the last stages of trying to [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1389.28s)]
*  maybe get a little bit more pragmatic. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1393.56s)]
*  Baste is the word people might use for that. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1396.12s)]
*  Just being super candid, but let's get, let's get into a little bit of an update [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1398.04s)]
*  here about the absolute tragedy occurring in Los Angeles. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1402.56s)]
*  The death toll is now at 25, uh, 12,000 structures have been destroyed. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1405.76s)]
*  It's mostly people's homes. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1410.32s)]
*  It's 40,000 acres. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1411.52s)]
*  That's 60 square miles. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1412.96s)]
*  I think San Francisco is seven by seven miles, right? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1415.96s)]
*  So this is a lot of space. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1418.76s)]
*  It's bigger than all of San Francisco. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1421.56s)]
*  The Palisades and Eaton fires are still burning. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1424.24s)]
*  And as of Wednesday, 80,000 people were under evacuation orders. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1427.16s)]
*  A couple of our friends lost their homes and, uh, but they survive. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1433.04s)]
*  But the stories of losing everything are just tragic. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1437.92s)]
*  Every memory, all your personal documents, photos, art, whatever [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1441.36s)]
*  that you've collected over a lifetime. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1447.28s)]
*  I just had two conversations with people and they were just in shock. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1449.32s)]
*  The estimates right now of damage are between 135 billion and $150 billion. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1453.96s)]
*  This is some of the most expensive real estate on the planet. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1460.12s)]
*  It's 10 times more costly than any other wildfire in history. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1464.0s)]
*  According to reports, you might remember the camp fire near Paradise, California. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1468.44s)]
*  That's about what? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1473.64s)]
*  Three hours north of San Francisco, Northeast. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1474.52s)]
*  That one was 12.5 billion just to level set it. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1477.4s)]
*  Uh, and now people are talking about, and we'll talk about here today, what the [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1481.44s)]
*  recovery and rebuild effort might look like. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1487.16s)]
*  California leadership, Disgraciad across the board. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1490.88s)]
*  I just, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1496.92s)]
*  Gavin Newsom. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1500.0s)]
*  Have you had traffic to Disgraciad.com with all of this? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1501.1200000000001s)]
*  Right now, Disgraciad.com is going to be redirected to Gavin or Karen Bass. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1504.0s)]
*  I don't know which one is more disgraceful. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1508.6s)]
*  I mean, it's an incredible troll that you just redirected every [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1510.64s)]
*  week to whoever you're madest at. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1514.52s)]
*  Who would be more disgraceful in this situation? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1518.44s)]
*  Gavin or Karen Bass? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1520.4s)]
*  I think it's gotta be Karen Bass for just being part of the country. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1522.16s)]
*  I think, I think it would be quite funny if every week you actually gave an award [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1524.44s)]
*  and redirected the website to the person that you believe. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1528.36s)]
*  And before that, it was Jake Paul for that Tyson fight. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1531.44s)]
*  And the Disgraciad.com, but it's the mistakes have gone up. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1534.44s)]
*  Gavin is now doing executive orders. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1540.0s)]
*  One of them is to make it illegal to global offers to impacted homeowners [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1544.36s)]
*  for the next three months. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1549.4s)]
*  I don't know what the point of that is. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1551.24s)]
*  And the other one is to eliminate the coastal acts review of permits for the [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1554.32s)]
*  houses that are alone. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1561.08s)]
*  PCH, I suppose. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1563.6399999999999s)]
*  And he wants to extend key price gouging protections, quote, to help make rebuilding [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1566.6399999999999s)]
*  more affordable gouging is defined as raising the rent or price of other goods [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1574.3999999999999s)]
*  and services more than 10% from the last market price. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1579.52s)]
*  But it could be as little as 5%. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1584.52s)]
*  It's just not clear. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1586.0s)]
*  And then LA mayor, Karen Bass created a snitch hotline. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1586.8s)]
*  To report on any kind of price gouging and rents, which we've started to see [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1591.2s)]
*  people are now naming and shaming Zillow and Redfin listings where they, you can [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1596.2s)]
*  see the previous history of what they were asking for, for a home or for rent. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1602.32s)]
*  And obviously the free market is making rental homes double in price. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1606.32s)]
*  Freeburg, we talked a bunch about this and I know pink is you've got, we had, I [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1612.56s)]
*  don't know if you're comfortable talking about it, but we had a whole conversation [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1616.6s)]
*  about your getting dragged by the coastal commission in Northern California. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1618.96s)]
*  Freeburg, maybe kick us off here on what your thoughts are on rebuilding this area, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1625.64s)]
*  how this will happen, especially with what we brought up last week. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1632.3600000000001s)]
*  And I think when a bit viral is your sort of talk about putting your thumb [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1638.24s)]
*  on the scale with insurance. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1641.8s)]
*  I mean, this is, I think one of the concerning things here is the free [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1643.6399999999999s)]
*  market not being allowed to progress previously with insurance and then now. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1649.6399999999999s)]
*  With the rebuild. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1654.56s)]
*  Well, California has got at this point, price controls or a mechanism for [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1656.0s)]
*  controlling the change in price on insurance, on housing services. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1661.6s)]
*  And now they've got this non solicitation rule. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1668.12s)]
*  All three, I think are very challenging to, I think an appropriate market recovery. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1671.36s)]
*  Look, the insurance issue is a longer one. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1678.68s)]
*  If you guys want, we could talk about that. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1680.2s)]
*  I've got a couple of notes I can bring up on the history of how we got to this point, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1681.52s)]
*  but I think it's going to be the one of the biggest burdens going forward. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1685.24s)]
*  And it could actually lead to a pretty significant effect in longterm [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1688.52s)]
*  housing prices in California because of the way that the insurance market is [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1692.44s)]
*  structured and regulated in California. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1696.92s)]
*  But if you want, we can talk about that. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1699.16s)]
*  Up or down. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1700.64s)]
*  What do you think ultimately, you know, TLDR, like, do you think prices [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1701.3600000000001s)]
*  are going to go way up here? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1705.68s)]
*  Do you think this is going to take five or 10 years to rebuild these homes? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1707.28s)]
*  I mean, we've never seen this many structures go down at this price [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1710.5600000000002s)]
*  point in a constrained area where. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1715.3200000000002s)]
*  Just construction is so expensive and hard. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1718.48s)]
*  So I think the governor did a good job suspending the permitting requirements [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1720.48s)]
*  for the coastal act for a given time period. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1724.0400000000002s)]
*  And the CEQA review, those are very important, I think suspensions, but [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1726.32s)]
*  he also put in place this executive order for price gouging. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1731.32s)]
*  And if you pull up the note, Nick, so he basically said California penal [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1734.44s)]
*  code section three nine six. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1737.96s)]
*  Which prohibits price gouging during a declared state of emergency will now [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1741.0s)]
*  extend indefinitely in this region. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1745.08s)]
*  And in the language in that penal code, it says that business is not going to [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1747.76s)]
*  In the language in that penal code, it says that businesses cannot raise the [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1752.76s)]
*  price of essential goods and services by more than 10% above their pre emergency [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1757.96s)]
*  price for a specified period. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1762.84s)]
*  And in this case, his executive order is indefinitely. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1765.8s)]
*  So in on an indefinite basis, you cannot raise the price of goods and services. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1769.2s)]
*  Which generally applies to consumer goods like food and emergency supplies, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1774.4s)]
*  but it also applies to building materials and services related to housing work. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1778.36s)]
*  So if you want to attract. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1783.08s)]
*  Builders, if you want to attract contractors, if you want to attract [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1786.68s)]
*  electricians and plumbers to go to the LA area, you have to allow the [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1790.12s)]
*  market to do its job. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1795.16s)]
*  If I'm a plumber operating in Sacramento or in Phoenix, and I'm like, man, I [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1797.04s)]
*  could make some money if I go to LA, you will see an influx of service providers [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1800.84s)]
*  and an influx of goods to support the rebuilding effort in Southern California. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1805.68s)]
*  That's the way the free market should work is there's an opportunity in the [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1809.52s)]
*  market. Folks show up. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1813.52s)]
*  They say, great, I can make money. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1814.64s)]
*  I'm going to come here and do this work. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1816.48s)]
*  And as more folks show up, they begin to compete on price and eventually the [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1818.2s)]
*  cost kind of normalizes and you end up finding what is now the new fair market [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1823.0s)]
*  value between the bid and the ask the people that are saying, Hey, I'll do the [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1827.72s)]
*  work there. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1831.8s)]
*  They ask and Hey, I need people to do work. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1832.24s)]
*  That's the bid and you find a price. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1834.3600000000001s)]
*  But the benefit of that is you increase the supply, you increase the supply of [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1836.1599999999999s)]
*  goods, you increase the supply of service providers, of contractors. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1840.0s)]
*  There is a home building dearth right now in the United States. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1843.56s)]
*  So this is an amazing opportunity because they can now move to LA, build homes. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1846.1999999999998s)]
*  We can get a rapid reconstruction effort underway, except the governor just said [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1850.6s)]
*  we can't pay people 10% higher than what they were getting paid right before this [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1855.6s)]
*  happened on an indefinite basis. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1859.8799999999999s)]
*  And then Karen Bass created a hotline. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1861.6399999999999s)]
*  You can go to LA 311 and report people if they're trying to charge too much. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1863.28s)]
*  And then the, uh, you know, the Stasi will come and investigate you and [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1867.36s)]
*  determine that you're charging too much. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1870.76s)]
*  I understand that there's a strong moral imperative and incentive to say, we [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1872.48s)]
*  got to stop price gouging. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1876.44s)]
*  We don't want people to get hurt. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1877.8s)]
*  But the second order effect is you're actually hurting the market and you're [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1879.24s)]
*  hurting the rebuild effort because you're reducing the incentive for folks to come [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1882.36s)]
*  in and fill the void in the market. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1886.0s)]
*  That is necessary for us to accelerate the development of 15,000 homes in a very [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1887.52s)]
*  short period of time. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1892.16s)]
*  The alternative now is people are going to be sitting around and I already spoke [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1893.24s)]
*  to a couple of friends. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1896.4s)]
*  I'm sure you guys have that are like, I tried calling architects. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1897.1200000000001s)]
*  I tried calling contractors, people that live in this area that have been affected. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1899.92s)]
*  I cannot get anyone to return my call. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1903.16s)]
*  There is not enough service providers down there. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1905.28s)]
*  You're going to end up waiting six, seven years to get your home rebuilt. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1907.6s)]
*  Now what do you do? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1910.48s)]
*  You own a lot. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1911.56s)]
*  You don't have a home to live in. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1913.16s)]
*  And then there's this other thing where we can't take unsolicited [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1915.08s)]
*  offers on the home. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1918.16s)]
*  That was the other executive order. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1918.88s)]
*  If you want to pull that one up, the governor said it is illegal to make an [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1920.0s)]
*  unsolicited offer on a piece of real estate in one of these affected zip codes. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1924.64s)]
*  I don't know what happened in Hawaii that makes the governor keep referencing the [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1929.8s)]
*  Hawaii story as if, you know, that there were people that were taken advantage of [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1935.32s)]
*  and we need to protect the citizens of LA, but I'm pretty sure that having an [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1939.16s)]
*  increase in the number of offers coming in for real estate in one of these [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1944.24s)]
*  affected areas increases liquidity in the market and increases the buying [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1948.44s)]
*  behavior, and that will ultimately drive prices up and that will ultimately make [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1952.4s)]
*  it easier by having more liquidity for some of these folks who owned burned down [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1957.24s)]
*  lots to be able to sell their lot, take their insurance check, move to another [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1961.2s)]
*  neighborhood and go somewhere else because they're going to have to [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1965.52s)]
*  otherwise wait six or seven years to build a home. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1967.48s)]
*  I think you're a little bit off the deep end with some of this stuff, because I [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1972.16s)]
*  think you're not being totally fair in representing what this EO says. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1974.76s)]
*  And that's coming from me. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1980.28s)]
*  I mean, I am not a Newsom fan. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1981.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1984.52s)]
*  And I think he is completely and totally incompetent, but I'll just take the other [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1985.32s)]
*  side of this, which is that I read the EO and I actually think it's somewhat [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1991.8799999999999s)]
*  reasonable and I didn't connect the dots with the EO and the real estate market. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=1997.48s)]
*  And the reason is that if you read all of what he said, the EO is hyper [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2004.04s)]
*  specific to unsolicited offers to a very specific handful of zip codes. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2008.28s)]
*  And it was time boxed for three months. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2014.4s)]
*  So he said, making any unsolicited offer to an owner of real estate property [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2016.64s)]
*  located in the areas encompassed by any names, a bunch of zip codes. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2023.1200000000001s)]
*  I think there was like one, two, there's like 12 or 13 of them. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2027.3600000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2030.96s)]
*  So unsolicited. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2031.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2033.04s)]
*  Yep. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2033.3600000000001s)]
*  To, to acquire any interest in real property for an amount less than the [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2033.76s)]
*  fair market value of the property on January 6th. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2038.72s)]
*  So before the fire started and he said, and he said that's prohibited for three [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2044.8400000000001s)]
*  months, that's it for three months. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2051.04s)]
*  And the reason I think he said that is that if you just scope out a little bit, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2053.56s)]
*  just from this moment in Los Angeles, the problem is that after natural [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2058.2400000000002s)]
*  disasters, there is a spike in fraudulent activities. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2063.2s)]
*  And there are people that try to take advantage of that situation to make money. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2067.3599999999997s)]
*  So for example, after hurricanes, we saw this in Florida, people pose as [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2071.8799999999997s)]
*  contractors, they come in and they offer inflated prices, they offer poor quality [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2076.08s)]
*  of work, and especially when you sort of deregulate for that moment, where there's [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2080.7599999999998s)]
*  less checks, there's less folks involved because you're trying to speed up the [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2086.72s)]
*  process, you can have a bunch of pressure tactics that work against the best [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2090.92s)]
*  interests of the person trying to rebuild on the wildfire side. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2096.12s)]
*  There was this crazy thing, Nick, I'll send you the link from KTLA that talked [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2100.28s)]
*  about these folks called fire chasers, which are essentially like, you know, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2104.76s)]
*  wildfire scammers or ambulance chasers, but during fires. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2108.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2111.88s)]
*  So, so, so my point is, I don't disagree with his incompetence. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2112.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2115.6800000000003s)]
*  And I think he is totally out of touch. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2116.4s)]
*  I think there's a broken cartel that runs the state that's going to drive this [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2119.24s)]
*  state into just complete disrepair. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2123.24s)]
*  He was going to negligent. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2126.8s)]
*  Well, they're already in, you can't say a state that has $322 billion budget [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2128.88s)]
*  is already bankrupt. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2135.12s)]
*  It's, it's teetering on a path where we won't be able to return and we can [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2136.4s)]
*  debate that, but my point is, I just think despite all of this, he is [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2140.56s)]
*  grossly negligent. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2145.24s)]
*  Karen Bass is grossly negligent. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2146.52s)]
*  The California cartel is breaking this date, but on this specific narrow [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2148.8799999999997s)]
*  thing, I kind of will give him his flowers. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2153.4399999999996s)]
*  I think it was like a decent, smart, good thing. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2155.8799999999997s)]
*  It's narrowly focused. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2159.6s)]
*  There's a specific window here that's time boxed so that the worst [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2161.12s)]
*  behaviors of other people are roughly managed and mitigated until we can [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2165.3999999999996s)]
*  figure out a better answer. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2170.4399999999996s)]
*  You're saying that unsolicited offers on real estate can drive fraud. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2171.68s)]
*  What you talked about, if there was a person that is, this does not prevent [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2177.16s)]
*  somebody from selling. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2181.56s)]
*  Let's talk about services separately because he has a separate EO on services. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2182.56s)]
*  This does not prevent anybody whose house burned down from listing his lot. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2185.88s)]
*  You could sell it for a dollar. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2190.08s)]
*  That's right. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2191.6s)]
*  So it's not, it's, I think it's, it's not right. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2191.92s)]
*  And it's inaccurate to say that this is perturbing and distorting the free [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2194.7599999999998s)]
*  market. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2198.72s)]

*  It will be non-zero that will make a mistake. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2241.08s)]

*  The fact that you can't increase pricing on goods and services by more than 10% [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2252.84s)]
*  for an indefinite period. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2257.0s)]

*  This grand ideal of the free market will solve everything. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2265.4s)]
*  Isn't necessarily always true. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2270.2s)]

*  the abuses will be the highest. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2281.2799999999997s)]

*  some of our friends, I've spoken to them over the last few days, I've spoken to [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2299.52s)]
*  their wives. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2303.3599999999997s)]
*  Honestly, I'll say, I'll say it in a horrible way. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2307.44s)]
*  One person said this to me and I'll just, I'll just quote him. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2312.2s)]
*  The amount of people that have reached out to me, if you had asked me two weeks [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2314.56s)]
*  ago, why would so many people reach out with condolences? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2318.52s)]
*  I would have thought that one of my children had died. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2322.08s)]
*  That's what he said to me. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2324.08s)]
*  And it completely struck me with it's not on that same level, but the amount of [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2325.0s)]
*  emotional turmoil that these families are going through probably approaches that. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2330.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't think many of those people are in a condition to make good decisions right [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2335.12s)]
*  now. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2338.24s)]
*  So I almost think a cooling off period actually benefits everybody. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2338.3599999999997s)]
*  It can allow the free market to work in a few months from now. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2342.68s)]
*  We're only talking 90 days. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2346.2s)]
*  No, no, the, the services thing is indefinite. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2347.72s)]
*  That's, that's what I think is a little bit frustrating. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2349.64s)]
*  Let me bring Mark in here. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2351.68s)]
*  Mark, you heard both sides of this debate. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2352.44s)]
*  If you had a lot in the Pacific Palisades that burned down and people started [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2355.68s)]
*  making unsolicited offer, listen, you're sophisticated. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2360.84s)]
*  I've known you for 20 plus years. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2363.24s)]
*  Uh, you're very sophisticated, obviously. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2365.72s)]
*  But do you think that's a reasonable thing to do to put a moratorium on people making [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2367.88s)]
*  these low bid offers and then we'll get to the construction piece second, but you [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2373.6000000000004s)]
*  know, what do you think of these? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2377.4s)]
*  Unsolicited offers. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2378.7200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2380.04s)]
*  Unsolicited offers. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2380.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2381.4s)]
*  What do you, what do you think of that? [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2381.6000000000004s)]
*  I think what, what bothers me about it, there's a presumption and, and maybe [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2382.76s)]
*  Chamath's right in it. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2388.2400000000002s)]
*  You're getting me to think about it a little more than I was, but, but I'm pretty [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2389.7200000000003s)]
*  much where Freeberg is that we're, we're kind of treating these people like children. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2393.4s)]
*  Cause we're, what we're saying is that they're not capable of making good decisions. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2400.7999999999997s)]
*  So we need to protect them from themselves. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2406.92s)]
*  And we're saying, so we don't want you to know that somebody is willing to pay X [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2409.8399999999997s)]
*  dollars for your property because you might take it and you might regret later that [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2416.68s)]
*  you took that is kind of what Chamath is saying. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2421.76s)]
*  No, in a, in a very narrow window where you may not have the best and clearest [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2424.5200000000004s)]
*  ability to make the best decision for you because you're dealing with so many [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2430.5200000000004s)]
*  other crazy issues in your life. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2433.6400000000003s)]
*  And that's, you could say no, but you're presuming there's, there's one side that [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2435.7200000000003s)]
*  bothers me that feels like what we've had from the democratic party forever, which [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2441.7200000000003s)]
*  is that this, this big wise overlord that's going to protect us from ourselves, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2446.2s)]
*  from our worst natures. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2453.6s)]
*  And then on the other hand, you're bringing up something, Chamath that I hadn't [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2455.64s)]
*  thought about that I'm just thinking more about now, which is, well, maybe people [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2460.08s)]
*  could be taken advantage of at the margin because they're in, they feel like they're [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2464.3199999999997s)]
*  in a dire position, but, but if they think they're in a dire position, they might [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2470.52s)]
*  really be in a dire position. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2474.92s)]
*  So they might really need that money. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2476.36s)]
*  Well, for example, let's just say that you haven't heard back from the banks that [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2479.2400000000002s)]
*  own your mortgage about whether there's going to be a moratorium on mortgage [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2482.48s)]
*  payments. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2487.0s)]
*  And so now you're trying to juggle paying for an extra rental and this house while [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2488.0s)]
*  you're trying to figure out where to put your kids. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2492.2400000000002s)]
*  And somebody shows up and says, Hey, I will buy this from you. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2493.76s)]
*  I think that there are a lot of people who would otherwise be able to make a much [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2497.7200000000003s)]
*  more rational decision who may make a panic decision in that moment. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2501.8s)]
*  And I think that if you give people a 90 day cooling off period, I think it at [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2506.2400000000002s)]
*  least shines a light on whether all of this governmental and other infrastructure [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2510.52s)]
*  can actually do something for these people. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2516.04s)]
*  I do think that there is a moment at which you can't govern these things. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2519.04s)]
*  And all I'm suggesting is a very narrow window of time where people's feelings of [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2522.6000000000004s)]
*  just like desperation are at their highest. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2528.2400000000002s)]
*  I think that this is a decent thing to do. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2530.64s)]
*  You know, there is some precedent for the state doing stuff like this. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2533.04s)]
*  You know, in most states, there is a cooling off period with marriages and [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2536.96s)]
*  divorces. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2541.56s)]
*  You have to wait three days to file either way to get married or to get divorced. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2542.44s)]
*  Let's talk about the construction process here. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2547.44s)]
*  Free brokers. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2549.4s)]
*  I think that's the most important one because we're going to rebuild. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2549.88s)]
*  If you don't pay a premium to get somebody to leave another market, come to [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2553.48s)]
*  this one, which is what's going to be required. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2559.96s)]
*  There are simply not enough construction people in any state. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2561.56s)]
*  That's right. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2564.4s)]
*  So now you're competing with another state. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2564.84s)]
*  That's right. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2566.48s)]
*  This immediately triggered the debate and dare I say courage that Travis had [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2566.84s)]
*  around this issue with surge pricing for Uber, Lyft and sidecar and a bunch of [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2572.92s)]
*  other folks who were kind of virtue signaling were like, we don't ever want [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2578.64s)]
*  to do surge pricing. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2582.04s)]
*  Therefore there were never cars on the road on Friday and Saturday nights when [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2582.92s)]
*  people needed them or during, you know, inclement weather, snow storms, or. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2587.12s)]
*  On New Year's Eve. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2595.84s)]
*  And he said, if you want to increase supply, we believe Uber should have [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2597.16s)]
*  availability. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2600.84s)]
*  Lyft took a different decision. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2601.64s)]
*  We're going to have no surge pricing and they just simply weren't available. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2603.04s)]
*  So maybe what do you think about that piece, Pinkus? [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2606.44s)]
*  You think that the free market and people should be able to say, you know [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2609.72s)]
*  what, I'll pay you time and a half to come here. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2615.36s)]
*  I'll pay you double time to work Saturday and Sundays. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2617.36s)]
*  I'll get a couple of RVs, put them in the back. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2620.28s)]
*  If you want to have some folks live on the construction site. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2622.44s)]
*  And if you hit these dates, I'll pay you a bonus for hitting it. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2625.44s)]
*  Doesn't seem like any of that would be wrong to me for somebody who had the [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2628.88s)]
*  ability to pay an incentive for somebody to move from another state would be out [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2633.56s)]
*  of line here. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2639.6800000000003s)]
*  What are your thoughts on that? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2640.4s)]
*  I agree. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2642.48s)]
*  I mean, I'm, I'm pretty much just a free market believer. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2643.0s)]
*  And so I think other than guardrails like Chamath saying, and maybe I like the idea [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2648.84s)]
*  of cooling off periods, it kind of makes sense. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2654.36s)]
*  But outside of that, when it comes to service providers, yeah, you have the [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2657.0s)]
*  opposite problem right now, which is like you're saying you need to incentivize a [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2660.84s)]
*  huge construction force to come to LA and the cost for them to get there, to [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2665.6s)]
*  find housing themselves is going to be even higher or the amount of distance [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2674.08s)]
*  they're going to have to travel every day. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2679.88s)]
*  So I think, I think this could have real unintended consequences and just stop [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2681.32s)]
*  the, just stop the wheels from turning on rebuilding all these homes, which [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2688.52s)]
*  make it way more complex. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2693.7599999999998s)]
*  So I agree. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2695.7999999999997s)]
*  Chamath, any final thoughts on the rebuild and the free market in that [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2697.56s)]
*  regard? [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2701.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2702.3199999999997s)]
*  I think this is where the government ineptitude is at its worst. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2702.8799999999997s)]
*  I think that we need to dismantle this regulatory state that makes doing the [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2710.12s)]
*  right thing impossible. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2715.9199999999996s)]
*  So specifically the thing that Newsom did was essentially create a time [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2717.52s)]
*  expectation on when things will get permitted. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2727.24s)]
*  And I think he said it was like six months. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2730.88s)]
*  The problem is like, this is what just goes to show you how insane the state [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2733.6s)]
*  has become, even if you get a permit within six months. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2738.16s)]
*  And this is where I do agree with Freeberg, like getting service people in [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2743.0s)]
*  being able to build something to spec safely is going to take three, four, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2746.08s)]
*  five, six years, and it's going to be insane. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2750.88s)]
*  And the example of the complete incompetence of the California state [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2754.2799999999997s)]
*  government is if you contrast and compare this with how the state was able to [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2758.7599999999998s)]
*  respond in the Northridge earthquake. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2764.16s)]
*  And the crazy thing, which I thought was incredible was after the 1994 [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2767.0s)]
*  Northridge earthquake, they rebuilt I-10, right? [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2771.08s)]
*  Which is like, that is like a crazy artery. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2775.48s)]
*  In 66 days, guys, they rebuilt it. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2778.48s)]
*  Not they permitted it, not that they were trying to get the California coastal [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2782.32s)]
*  commission to opine on it, not a Sierra club lawsuit about the upper land grouse. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2786.12s)]
*  They rebuilt it. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2791.56s)]
*  So you actually know what's possible in California if tradesmen are allowed to go [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2792.96s)]
*  to work. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2798.44s)]
*  They can build incredibly complicated things with safety, with speed. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2799.6800000000003s)]
*  This is where Newsom, I don't think understands how the real market works. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2804.56s)]
*  Because if you looked at that example, the real question you should be asking is, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2808.56s)]
*  well, what has changed? [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2812.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, technology has gotten way better since then. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2813.88s)]
*  The people are more skilled. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2817.04s)]
*  There are more people to be able to do more of these jobs. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2819.28s)]
*  And so why does it only take six months to just get the permit when in 120 days, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2822.04s)]
*  you could just rebuild an entire highway. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2825.84s)]
*  Similarly, why aren't we saying that we expect these homes built in the next three [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2827.3999999999996s)]
*  years, get these kids back in their homes and back in school? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2831.04s)]
*  You know what they did on that? [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2833.9199999999996s)]
*  They offered a $200,000 per day early build bonus on that program back then. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2836.04s)]
*  So they basically, the state declared we need this freeway reopened and here's [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2841.7999999999997s)]
*  the date. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2847.8799999999997s)]
*  It was like 144 days. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2848.3199999999997s)]
*  And they're like, you'll get a $200,000 bonus for every day under 144 that you [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2849.68s)]
*  deliver it. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2853.52s)]
*  So, so, wow. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2854.2s)]
*  Show me an incentive. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2856.2s)]
*  I'll show you an outcome. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2857.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2858.12s)]
*  The really interesting thing here is there are regulations that this is a unique [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2858.9199999999996s)]
*  opportunity to put in place. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2863.04s)]
*  Nick, if you can pull it up, there was a home that wasn't burned in the Pacific [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2866.4399999999996s)]
*  Palisades and the architect talked about some of the design decisions there. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2869.8799999999997s)]
*  You know, having stone scaping around your home, gravel, et cetera, and using [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2876.2799999999997s)]
*  these new materials and not having overhangs, which, and then having vents [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2881.2799999999997s)]
*  into your attic, which is what a lot of homes have and the embers get into the [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2886.24s)]
*  attic, there's an overhang and they're not using, and they're all wood built. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2890.9199999999996s)]
*  You know, none of this is concrete. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2894.96s)]
*  None of it's brick. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2896.8399999999997s)]
*  California is all wood. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2898.24s)]
*  And so they probably should add some regulations about building things that are [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2899.3599999999997s)]
*  fireproof because if you had a hundred homes that were all fireproof and built to [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2904.64s)]
*  withstand this, that would act as a natural break. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2909.2799999999997s)]
*  And if you didn't have as much vegetation, so there's probably a series of things [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2912.52s)]
*  that should be added here in terms of regulations while you're getting rid of [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2916.3599999999997s)]
*  some of the ones that are slowing you down. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2919.8399999999997s)]
*  But let's pivot over to, oh, and then finally, like allowing people to park [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2922.12s)]
*  their mobile homes in these places to have housing for construction, to your [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2927.12s)]
*  point, Mark, would be super critical. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2930.9199999999996s)]
*  And they block that kind of stuff. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2932.72s)]
*  So when you need temporary housing in California, you can't do it. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2934.0s)]
*  By the way, I want to, I want to hear what Freeberg has to say about insurance, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2937.28s)]
*  but let me connect the dots between what you said and what he's about to say. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2940.88s)]
*  There are three images I just want to show you guys. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2944.96s)]
*  And to bubble this up for everybody that isn't necessarily living in California [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2947.1200000000003s)]
*  and is consumed with what all of this means, there's a bigger trend across the [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2952.04s)]
*  country that I think is just worth putting out there. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2957.2400000000002s)]
*  So Nick, do you want to just show the first chart from FEMA? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2959.88s)]
*  So this is basically a graph per locality all over the United States, where [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2963.32s)]
*  FEMA tries to assess the disaster risk for living in a given area. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2969.88s)]
*  And what you see here is that there's some risk in living on the Eastern [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2975.96s)]
*  seaboard and there's a lot of risk and it's growing for living on the Western [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2980.64s)]
*  seaboard. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2984.2s)]
*  And the two most complicated states that have to deal with this are clearly [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2985.48s)]
*  Florida and California. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2990.52s)]
*  So that's one, which is this is a problem that isn't just focused on this one [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2993.2s)]
*  little area. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2998.52s)]
*  So then if you double click a little bit further, there's a company called Core [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=2999.56s)]
*  Logic. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3003.52s)]
*  They publish a lot of real estate data. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3003.96s)]
*  Here's a chart about the Western United States that just double clicks into [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3006.32s)]
*  wildfire risk. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3010.08s)]
*  And I was shocked when I saw this. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3011.96s)]
*  This is, first of all, most of California. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3013.8s)]
*  This is like Nevada. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3017.76s)]
*  This is Arizona. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3019.08s)]
*  This is parts of Texas. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3020.16s)]
*  This is Washington. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3021.6s)]
*  I didn't even know the fire risk went up that high, but this is essentially a lot [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3022.56s)]
*  of the Western United States. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3028.16s)]
*  And then the last chart goes through and it actually does, Core Logic does an [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3029.72s)]
*  assessment of the value at risk. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3033.92s)]
*  So in California, it's three quarters of a trillion dollars that are at about [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3037.32s)]
*  1.26 million homes that are at moderate or great risk of fires. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3043.0s)]
*  In Colorado, it's about 141 billion. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3050.44s)]
*  In Texas, it's 88 billion. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3053.88s)]
*  In Oregon, it's 45 billion. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3055.84s)]
*  In Arizona, it's 36 billion. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3057.7200000000003s)]
*  The point is that everything you said, Jason, now needs to get scaled out, meaning [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3059.48s)]
*  there needs to be a national level conversation. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3068.0s)]
*  This can't be a bunch of city planners making code and making laws in a little [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3070.4s)]
*  municipality. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3076.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3077.28s)]
*  Because that problem, what that shows you is we have a multi-trillion dollar risk to [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3077.72s)]
*  a lot of people in the Western United States, specifically around this issue, that [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3084.2s)]
*  has to get dealt with by code. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3089.96s)]
*  All right. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3091.92s)]
*  Really interesting in New York. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3092.68s)]
*  Finally, New York has put into place congestion pricing. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3094.44s)]
*  I've been waiting for this my entire life. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3098.7599999999998s)]
*  Here's a map. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3102.32s)]
*  This went into effect January 5th. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3103.56s)]
*  This congestion pricing concept exists in London, as everybody probably knows. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3105.88s)]
*  Basically, if you're below Central Park, which is 6th Street in Manhattan, and you [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3111.6000000000004s)]
*  enter between 5 a.m. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3115.92s)]
*  and 9 p.m., you're going to get, you know, on your EZPass a charge of but $9 cheaper [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3117.1600000000003s)]
*  than a bacon, egg, and cheese in Manhattan these days. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3123.88s)]
*  If you're going clubbing in Manhattan between 9 p.m. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3126.44s)]
*  and 5 a.m., it's just like two bucks. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3128.88s)]
*  It's going to increase to $12 in 2028 and $15 in 2031. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3131.08s)]
*  Trucks pay more, taxes pay less. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3135.8799999999997s)]
*  The results have been awesome. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3138.12s)]
*  Wait times to get on the island are down 50% across the board, Lincoln tunnel, down [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3140.7999999999997s)]
*  46% Holland tunnel, down 63% Williamsburg Bridge, down 35%. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3146.48s)]
*  It's just an awesome effort. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3151.8799999999997s)]
*  When I lived there, man, as a resident, the traffic was nuts. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3154.3199999999997s)]
*  You can have emergency services move. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3158.24s)]
*  A lot faster. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3160.68s)]
*  You get rid of noise pollution. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3161.44s)]
*  You obviously get rid of air quality pollution for ice engines. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3163.44s)]
*  It's great for cabs, great for pedestrians and great for bike riders. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3167.2s)]
*  The only people really complaining are selfish and entitled people who drive [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3171.7599999999998s)]
*  their cars into Manhattan. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3176.68s)]
*  That's at least my position on it. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3178.56s)]
*  Opponents are saying it's a money grab for the transit authority because the money [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3180.96s)]
*  from this goes to make public transportation better. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3185.12s)]
*  What do you think, Mark? [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3188.44s)]
*  You're in favor of this? [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3189.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think more generally, I feel like since the pandemic, what's been on my [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3191.6s)]
*  mind a lot living still in San Francisco, I wanted to start a social network called [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3198.3999999999996s)]
*  Still Here because it's like, oh, you still live here? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3202.8799999999997s)]
*  Me too. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3206.56s)]
*  Some way for us to like come out of our houses and notice that you're here and I'm [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3208.2s)]
*  here, but we never leave our homes. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3213.44s)]
*  I walk around this city at my own risk and I feel like cities have lost the point. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3215.2400000000002s)]
*  They've lost the plot. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3223.28s)]
*  We still live in cities or value them, but I feel like we have to go back to first [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3226.6s)]
*  principles and think why did we move to cities in the first place and what was the [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3230.6s)]
*  value supposed to be and is that still the deal we're getting? [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3235.2000000000003s)]
*  Or does it have to be a new deal? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3239.12s)]
*  Because we used to live in a city because it was economic. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3240.6400000000003s)]
*  We were closer to our job and then we lived in a city because there was a high [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3244.0s)]
*  density of things that we wanted, cultural people, restaurants, and the best cities [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3249.44s)]
*  really were the ones that are fun to walk around. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3256.12s)]
*  And then we got to a point where it's not safe or clean to walk around. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3259.44s)]
*  You don't work in the city anymore. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3264.2s)]
*  And San Francisco started to feel like this gigantic like retirement community. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3266.16s)]
*  It's just all these people who still live here because their kids are in school, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3270.12s)]
*  maybe, or they grew up here. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3273.4s)]
*  You know, a lot of our friends left, went to Austin and other places. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3275.76s)]
*  And we started, I don't know about Chamath, but I think Dave, but I think our family [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3281.36s)]
*  has a conversation probably twice a year of should we move? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3285.92s)]
*  Why haven't we moved? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3289.2000000000003s)]
*  What's wrong with us? [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3290.28s)]
*  And so there's this questioning going on around cities and I think it's a good [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3291.36s)]
*  question and I think cities need to innovate aggressively to give, to be better. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3295.48s)]
*  They have to compete with the other options again. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3302.56s)]
*  They have to make it fun to be there, fun to work there. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3305.44s)]
*  I think it's great that Daniel Lurie is mayor of San Francisco and he's putting [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3309.12s)]
*  smart people around him and they're trying to rethink first some of attacking [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3313.52s)]
*  these core problems, but also how do we make San Francisco fun again? [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3319.24s)]
*  So I love things like congestion pricing. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3324.84s)]
*  I think now is the time to try every new innovation that you ever thought of and [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3327.4s)]
*  see what sticks and, and figure out like, how do you take this, this tax? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3333.96s)]
*  Not literally. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3340.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, New York has a big tax, but this tax on all of us, whether it is that you [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3341.0s)]
*  can't walk across this city that you don't feel safe or that, that the, the [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3346.28s)]
*  good side of it being fun to be in, you know, is that the deal is off. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3351.8s)]
*  And so I think, you know, and I also, what I'm hoping Daniel Lurie does and [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3359.0400000000004s)]
*  other smart mayors is that they benchmark and they say, who's doing it really well [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3364.6400000000003s)]
*  around the world, whether it's dealing with homelessness or things like congestion [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3369.0800000000004s)]
*  pricing, who's, who's innovating and doing it well and why aren't we doing it here? [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3373.8s)]
*  I mean, I think you got to run these, you got to reinvent these cities and, you [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3379.2799999999997s)]
*  know, sorry to sound cliche, but I think you got to kind of take a startup [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3383.8799999999997s)]
*  mentality and say, you're not going to live on your incumbency anymore. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3386.9599999999996s)]
*  You've got to reinvent this and we can't make companies come back to work, you [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3390.9599999999996s)]
*  know, come back to the office. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3397.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean, the companies can make their employees, but it'd be really nice if [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3398.3999999999996s)]
*  the employees wanted to be there. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3401.72s)]
*  Um, you know, and you can't make people live in California, so I'm in favor. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3403.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3409.7599999999998s)]
*  Chamath, any thoughts on Mark's point about making cities fun again and joyful [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3410.2s)]
*  again, sounds like a pretty good platform. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3415.12s)]
*  I mean, I think he's right. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3418.2s)]
*  Um, San Francisco sucks. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3419.36s)]
*  It's trash. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3421.68s)]
*  You never go there. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3422.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3423.84s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3424.32s)]
*  And the reason that you don't like to go there is? [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3425.68s)]
*  It's dirty. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3428.72s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3429.7599999999998s)]
*  There's crime. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3430.8s)]
*  There's grime. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3431.8s)]
*  Everything just sucks there. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3433.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3435.24s)]
*  Freeburg, your thoughts on the Gotham city that's [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3436.0s)]
*  Did he visit you in the Presidio? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3440.96s)]
*  Dave, did Chamath ever come to the Presidio? [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3443.12s)]
*  I have come to your office. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3445.6s)]
*  I've come to Dave's office. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3446.8s)]
*  I've come to, I've gone to Peter's office there, but what I do is I, I [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3447.96s)]
*  don't even go through the city. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3452.12s)]
*  I go all the way around. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3453.04s)]
*  I drive all through the East Bay up through Berkeley. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3454.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3457.04s)]
*  I'm just kidding. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3457.32s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3458.72s)]
*  I just think that the city is very poorly managed. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3459.92s)]
*  And just the quality of many cities are poorly managed. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3462.16s)]
*  And I think that there's a common through line in these poorly managed cities. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3465.56s)]
*  All the things that you say, there's no will to do. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3470.64s)]
*  There's no will to keep crime at bay. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3474.08s)]
*  There's no will to make, you know, usable spaces for people. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3476.8799999999997s)]
*  There's no will to invest in the arts. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3480.0s)]
*  So what do you expect? [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3482.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3483.52s)]
*  There's more money collected by these cities, but there's just [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3483.92s)]
*  just more total grift, corruption and waste. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3486.64s)]
*  I really think that the city is very poorly managed. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3489.2799999999997s)]
*  I really like that you got to this will point because whether we come back to the [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3492.16s)]
*  coastal commission or not, or talk about California or San Francisco, I don't think [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3496.12s)]
*  it's really about the red tape. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3502.7599999999998s)]
*  I think it's about the willpower of the people who are running the tape and reading. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3504.7599999999998s)]
*  You're a hundred percent right. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3509.3999999999996s)]
*  Did you see this thing? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3510.8399999999997s)]
*  I have to read this to you because this is really stunning. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3512.2799999999997s)]
*  I, sorry, Mark, keep going, but you're so a thousand percent right. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3515.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, cause sure. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3519.0s)]
*  Maybe, maybe in one case Gavin can override the coastal commission, but it doesn't matter [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3520.6s)]
*  if you cut their red tape by 90%. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3527.12s)]
*  As long as there's any tape that they can use, the people running both the staff there [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3530.16s)]
*  and the people on the board have stated on their website that their policy is managed [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3536.6s)]
*  retreat. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3542.24s)]
*  They drew a new map of the California coastline. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3542.68s)]
*  If that's their intention, they're going to look for anything they can to stop and obstruct [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3545.64s)]
*  you. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3551.76s)]
*  So it's, it's really not like their hands are tied because there's so much permitting. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3552.0s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3556.92s)]
*  They've made a decision and the decision in California and San Francisco specifically [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3557.64s)]
*  was that we're going to cater to fentanyl dealers and junkies and that those people [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3561.56s)]
*  were going to get a stipend, a hotel room and be allowed to take a super drug on the [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3566.36s)]
*  streets. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3573.08s)]
*  Thousands of people with no recourse. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3574.16s)]
*  Listen, I'm pro drug. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3576.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3578.08s)]
*  Here's, I sent you guys a, I sent you guys a, but not fentanyl and meth. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3578.48s)]
*  These things are super drugs. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3583.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3584.56s)]
*  Let's make it less about San Francisco. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3584.7999999999997s)]
*  Let's talk about middle Ohio and let's talk about Anderil. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3586.44s)]
*  Palmer Lucky did this really awesome. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3591.6s)]
*  Shout out. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3594.2799999999997s)]
*  Really awesome interview. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3595.44s)]
*  Nick, I just sent you the link to it. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3596.3199999999997s)]
*  He's building a new Ohio plant. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3598.52s)]
*  But the question and answer from the interviewer is exactly what Pink has talked about, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3601.92s)]
*  which is will the interview says, was this the only state that could guarantee that [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3607.12s)]
*  timeline that you needed? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3614.32s)]
*  And here's Palmer's answer. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3615.52s)]
*  Was this the only state that could guarantee that timeline? [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3617.56s)]
*  I think that they were the state that gave us the best shot of hitting that timeline. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3620.7200000000003s)]
*  Look, we've really engaged well with jobs, Ohio, with a lot of the politicians here, [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3624.76s)]
*  not just at the state level, but the local level, you know, like you said, we're [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3629.2000000000003s)]
*  hiring four thousand people here in direct jobs, a lot more jobs than that in a direct [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3631.84s)]
*  or sorry, an indirect capacity. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3636.8s)]
*  It's the largest single job creation event in Ohio history. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3638.28s)]
*  It was a state that told us we have the workforce. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3641.88s)]
*  We have a million people who are capable of working in this facility within a 45 minute [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3644.84s)]
*  drive. We're willing to work with you on higher education to help train people so they [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3648.2000000000003s)]
*  can come in and they can work with you. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3652.4s)]
*  Our customer in the form of the United States Air Force, the United States Air Force, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3654.8s)]
*  obviously is a huge presence here in the form of Wright-Patterson Air Force base. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3658.08s)]
*  So really all the stars aligned to make Ohio a great place for us to do it and to do it [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3661.56s)]
*  fast. And speaking candidly, as someone who is from California, there's some states [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3665.7200000000003s)]
*  that are really good at pushing you out and slowing you down. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3670.04s)]
*  And there's others that are great at pulling you in and speeding you up. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3674.12s)]
*  And that's what Ohio was. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3677.2400000000002s)]
*  Fantastic. Yeah. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3678.52s)]
*  States are competing for elite companies. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3680.52s)]
*  And there's a willpower that's that there's an intention. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3684.64s)]
*  And you know that if they want to make it happen, they'll make it happen. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3689.0s)]
*  Just like Gavin just did. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3692.76s)]
*  Right. Gavin could have theoretically, I don't know, signed an executive order to [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3694.1200000000003s)]
*  override the Coastal Commission on even his de-sail plant. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3699.4s)]
*  Like, I don't know why he didn't just force that through. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3703.8s)]
*  But if we had de-sail, maybe there'd be more water to fight the fire now. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3706.6400000000003s)]
*  So I think the important thing is to note that cities have a right to be what they [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3710.36s)]
*  want to be. You guys might find this surprising, but I'm not necessarily of the [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3716.72s)]
*  belief that every city should necessarily cater to progress and acceleration and [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3722.2s)]
*  enterprise Asian and industrialization. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3728.3999999999996s)]
*  Look, when you go to Portofino every summer to month, you would probably, you know, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3731.9199999999996s)]
*  stop going and would be disappointed if you found out that they were building a [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3737.04s)]
*  giant glass tower apartment complex and a giant office building right by the Port [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3740.9199999999996s)]
*  of Fino port. Like, that's just not the character of what that city wants to be. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3746.44s)]
*  And I do remember when I first moved to San Francisco 25 years ago, it was. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3751.4s)]
*  It felt like a smaller European like city. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3756.8s)]
*  It wasn't overrun with technology companies at the time. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3759.44s)]
*  And it was the charm and the quaint nature and the smaller buildings of San Francisco [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3762.84s)]
*  that made it a beautiful, fantastic town. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3767.28s)]
*  I think that part of the challenge of San Francisco has been this diametrically kind [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3769.76s)]
*  of opposed viewpoint of progress from the technology sector and a desire to keep San [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3774.12s)]
*  Francisco a small city by the bay. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3779.7599999999998s)]
*  And that that frustration has manifested with a lot of kind of ugliness over the last [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3782.56s)]
*  couple of decades. In addition to obviously all the silly, stupid policies that just make [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3786.7999999999997s)]
*  no sense whatsoever. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3790.3599999999997s)]
*  They're rooted in people thinking that this is a good solution in the short term, but [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3792.16s)]
*  it creates extraordinary damage and harm in the long term separate. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3795.56s)]
*  But I do think that cities have a right to be what they want to be. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3799.0s)]
*  And I think that. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3802.0s)]
*  But Dave, I think that's just I just want to interject as a fellow San Franciscan for a [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3802.64s)]
*  long time, just as long as that. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3806.7999999999997s)]
*  That's the normal tension that's been here all along. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3810.12s)]
*  And that kind of makes the city culture great. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3813.04s)]
*  And there's you want to have this creative melting pot here. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3815.4s)]
*  But there's this other side that I think has come in to play in the last 15, 20 years or [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3821.36s)]
*  10, 15 years, which is this progressivism side, which we saw Chesa, you know, with. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3828.2000000000003s)]
*  And I think it's it's a different virus. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3834.1200000000003s)]
*  That's the ugly silliness I meant, I was saying. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3837.92s)]
*  But like, let's put that aside. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3839.84s)]
*  Let's put San Francisco aside. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3841.44s)]
*  I do think that a city can and should be what it wants to be. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3842.92s)]
*  Does it want to attract and build industry? [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3845.5600000000004s)]
*  Does it want to attract and build enterprising companies? [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3848.44s)]
*  Or does it want to be a small, quaint town? [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3852.1200000000003s)]
*  Does it want to stay, you know, with that? [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3854.2400000000002s)]
*  That's not the choice. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3856.76s)]
*  That's a false trade off. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3858.0800000000004s)]
*  The problem is that people in government at every level sells the former doesn't actually [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3859.4s)]
*  even give them that nor the latter. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3866.5200000000004s)]
*  What they give them is a dysfunctional hellscape instead. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3868.88s)]
*  So it doesn't do that, right? [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3872.5600000000004s)]
*  Because it doesn't make those promises. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3874.48s)]
*  It's not asking to elect people that are trying to do it. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3876.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, not every city is making that. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3878.6000000000004s)]
*  Why are we lying to everybody? [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3880.8s)]
*  And why are people falling for these lies over and over and over again? [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3882.28s)]
*  There's a moral clarity in telling the truth. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3885.12s)]
*  Portofino doesn't try to do that. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3887.68s)]
*  But I don't think the point is... [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3889.2s)]
*  You're saying that the cities that promise that and don't deliver... [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3890.2799999999997s)]
*  San Francisco promises it. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3893.2799999999997s)]
*  London promises it. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3895.16s)]
*  New York promises it. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3896.52s)]
*  These things are chaotic messes. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3898.48s)]
*  And it's not the trade off of, oh, while Paris has found a way to stay quaint. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3900.96s)]
*  That was never on the ballot. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3904.68s)]
*  Some person comes up and says, I'm going to spend X billion dollars a year. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3906.24s)]
*  Then another person shows up and says, actually, I'm going to spend it a totally different way. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3910.64s)]
*  They both claim to have measurements of how it's going to be great. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3914.4s)]
*  And my point is none of them are rooted in the real world. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3918.28s)]
*  Nobody knows how to actually run a business. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3921.4s)]
*  All the money gets wasted and nothing happens. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3923.2000000000003s)]
*  It neither stays quaint nor does it advance. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3925.96s)]
*  If you were living in Los Angeles, you had the opportunity to have Rick Caruso, [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3929.28s)]
*  who built so many amazing experiences and shops for the citizens there. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3933.4s)]
*  And you picked Karen Bass. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3942.44s)]
*  I looked on her Wikipedia page looking for any kind of operational position she ever filled. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3943.68s)]
*  It's you want to read her resume? [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3949.92s)]
*  It's tragic. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3951.52s)]
*  I mean, I just, I would literally, like I said last week, not send her to get my lunch [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3952.56s)]
*  because you know, that order would be totally screwed up. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3958.12s)]
*  She is so dis so unqualified. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3960.52s)]
*  And you had this perfect person, Rick Caruso, who literally you can't script this. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3963.44s)]
*  He built the Pacific Palisades Village. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3969.04s)]
*  When the days before there was going to be a fire, do you know what he did? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3971.52s)]
*  He hired water trucks to park on those streets. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3977.04s)]
*  You can find the picture, Nick, pull it up. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3980.7599999999998s)]
*  And he hired firefighters and people to protect the village that he built. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3983.44s)]
*  Karen Bass was in Ghana, partying, taking meetings. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3990.2s)]
*  I don't know what the connection between Los Angeles and their citizens and what they need [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3994.8s)]
*  to get done in Ghana after she promised she would not do this global, you know, globe [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=3999.84s)]
*  trotting, which she apparently has a track record of doing. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4005.36s)]
*  She left and stayed there knowing this was all coming. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4008.92s)]
*  Rick Caruso, who you didn't vote for mayor. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4012.84s)]
*  He did the right thing. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4016.92s)]
*  Vote these people out. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4018.2000000000003s)]

*  You can do it. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4021.28s)]
*  We recall Chesa Boudin. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4022.16s)]
*  You remember on the show, David Sacks, he is a Republican. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4024.04s)]
*  A Republican entrepreneur, venture capitalist. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4028.84s)]

*  They're unqualified. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4046.48s)]

*  Whatever. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4052.36s)]

*  Hundreds of people are doing it now. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4095.36s)]
*  Shame these people into resigning. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4096.92s)]
*  It's a very mature way for you to affect you. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4098.96s)]
*  You know what? [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4101.4s)]
*  It worked in Brooklyn. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4101.96s)]
*  Shame worked. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4102.96s)]
*  I don't know why people think they have no power. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4103.96s)]
*  You can literally just go in there and do things. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4106.08s)]
*  And one of the things you can do is recall them. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4108.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4110.48s)]
*  Do we have anything else except your polemicals left on the docket? [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4110.64s)]
*  All right. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4113.4s)]
*  Tick tock's future is in question right now. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4113.759999999999s)]
*  The ban is about to happen unless the pairing company ByteDance divests by [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4116.679999999999s)]
*  January 19th, which is this Sunday. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4122.48s)]
*  Tick tock will be banned in America. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4125.0s)]
*  Google and Apple are going to be forced to remove Tick Tock from their app stores. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4127.44s)]
*  And Oracle Tick Tock's cloud provider has to stop providing hosting services and cut [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4131.04s)]
*  ties, assuming ByteDance doesn't come up with a last minute deal. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4135.799999999999s)]
*  Tick tock's only hope is the Supreme Court blocking the law. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4139.4s)]
*  What do you think, Mark? [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4143.719999999999s)]
*  Do you think it's Chinese spyware? [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4145.08s)]
*  Do you think they should be forced to divest? [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4146.679999999999s)]
*  What do you think their repercussions will be? [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4149.32s)]
*  Here's what's so hard for me about this. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4151.719999999999s)]
*  On the one hand, part of it seems so obvious from a both, not just national [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4154.2s)]
*  security point of view, but also just fairness. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4159.5199999999995s)]
*  Like it's insane if you think about it, that there's a Chinese company that's [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4164.08s)]
*  arguing in court for protections under our constitution and freedom of speech [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4168.56s)]
*  when none of our companies have those kinds of rights in China, much less the [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4176.360000000001s)]
*  right to even operate there if they're not majority controlled or in line like [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4182.04s)]
*  you guys talked about with censorship or whatever else. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4186.92s)]
*  So on the one hand, it seems like a no brainer to me that on this case. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4189.52s)]
*  But what you're starting to see come up in the last couple of days, I'm even [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4195.200000000001s)]
*  hearing it from one of my daughters, who's a major tick tocker is the law of unintended [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4199.4400000000005s)]
*  consequences here is that we could see this band, especially if they don't get to [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4205.160000000001s)]
*  a deal with somebody. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4211.04s)]
*  And then the 170 million Americans, many younger Americans who rely on this, all [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4212.68s)]
*  of a sudden feel like this is censoring them and it's taking away their freedom of [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4220.0s)]
*  expression. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4224.96s)]
*  And it could backfire in a lot of ways. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4226.32s)]
*  And we're already seeing memes where they're going on to these other apps. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4229.16s)]
*  Like there's this Chinese red book, which is even worse. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4232.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4236.88s)]
*  I think that one is owned by the Chinese government. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4237.04s)]
*  And so we're driving them there. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4239.56s)]
*  And so, so I'm the best outcome, I think would be forced to divest and sell to [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4241.4s)]
*  another American company. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4247.76s)]
*  But if that doesn't happen, I I'm kind of nervous about a real backlash. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4250.96s)]
*  I'm delighted, Chamath, that our kids are going to go out and play and have [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4257.360000000001s)]
*  friendships and stop scrolling on TikTok. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4260.72s)]
*  What you described sounds awesome. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4264.080000000001s)]
*  I literally get on their iPads and phones when I sometimes allow them to have phones [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4266.360000000001s)]
*  and just delete the app and then they go get it back. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4272.56s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4275.080000000001s)]
*  Kids around it. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4276.160000000001s)]
*  What do you think, Chamath? [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4276.8s)]
*  What do you think is going to happen here? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4278.04s)]
*  I mentioned this to President Trump and I really think this is true. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4279.08s)]
*  The reason why there was so much bipartisan support for the bill as it worked through [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4284.24s)]
*  Congress is because I think that they were briefed on just how severe the security [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4288.84s)]
*  violations of this app are, because I don't think we've seen anything in modern [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4294.4800000000005s)]
*  history that is that is this controversial yet be so almost unanimous. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4298.64s)]
*  So I think that that's an important data point. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4305.52s)]
*  There is something happening in the app that they've been briefed on that makes [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4307.52s)]
*  them take this posture. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4313.4400000000005s)]
*  And when I listened to the Supreme Court arguments, I didn't hear a very compelling [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4316.64s)]
*  reason why this ban should be overturned. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4321.0s)]
*  So I do agree with Mark that we have to find a suitable home. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4324.56s)]
*  And I think that we'll probably find one. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4330.08s)]
*  And I think that it probably happens under the Trump presidency. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4331.96s)]
*  And whoever gets their hands on it gets their hands on an incredible asset that they [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4334.84s)]
*  will be able to buy extremely cheaply, because there is no way that there is a fair [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4341.8s)]
*  market value here deal for that asset, because whoever is the buyer is in the total catbird [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4346.12s)]
*  seat. And in order to get a deal done with the federal government, I think you're just [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4351.16s)]
*  going to get a basically like a buy it now price that's very cheap. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4355.28s)]
*  The other thing that I'll say, though, on a totally separate tangent. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4358.0s)]
*  So when I started hunting around, TikTok's real time recommendation algorithm was open [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4360.8s)]
*  source, the learning method. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4366.5199999999995s)]
*  Yep. Nick, do you want to just throw it up here? [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4368.24s)]
*  It's called Monolith. This is an incredible paper. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4369.68s)]
*  The cleverness of what these guys have built cannot be underestimated. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4372.24s)]
*  And what's incredible is what they describe in this paper, which I think, frankly, a lot [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4378.0s)]
*  of social apps would benefit from understanding is exactly how they built it to [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4383.08s)]
*  essentially not take this more monolithic training approach for recommendations. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4388.88s)]
*  But how do you do it in real time? [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4392.64s)]
*  How do you make it collisionless? [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4394.240000000001s)]
*  It's incredible. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4396.84s)]
*  This paper is a tour de force, and it just makes me realize that despite the. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4398.68s)]
*  Political maneuvering of this hot potato, there are some folks that have been working [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4406.92s)]
*  in that app or in the parent company that are truly technically talented. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4411.16s)]
*  And it's a bit of a shame that they're going to get sort of throw the baby out with the [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4416.64s)]
*  bath water, so to speak. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4420.320000000001s)]
*  So people should know that there's some technological innovations inside of ByteDance [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4421.56s)]
*  and TikTok that are just truly amazing feats of computer science. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4426.8s)]
*  This is an example. It doesn't, though, change the fact that I think that enough of [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4431.64s)]
*  Congress and the rest of the security apparatus know that this is a mechanism to spy. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4435.360000000001s)]
*  I think you both nailed it. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4440.160000000001s)]
*  Isn't China saying, though, that they're going to, if this does get divested, they're [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4441.280000000001s)]
*  going to keep me either by dance or Chinese government saying we're not going to give [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4445.92s)]
*  over the algorithm or are you saying it's open source? [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4450.32s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4452.68s)]
*  Well, this is an example of just sort of like describing the methodology. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4453.8s)]
*  It's not functionally open source yet, but I think that open sourcing it doesn't solve [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4456.88s)]
*  the problem. And the reason is so let's just say that you're Pegasus. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4460.92s)]
*  Pegasus was able to reverse engineer or build penetration attacks into WhatsApp that were [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4464.92s)]
*  imperceptible to everybody until it happened to Jeff Bezos, to other people. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4471.36s)]
*  Right. Where you get these state sponsored attacks on your phone. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4475.56s)]
*  And all of a sudden you're dealing with this attack vector that then you call the FBI and [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4480.280000000001s)]
*  they take your phone and they help you deal with. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4486.080000000001s)]
*  It's happened to a bunch of people. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4488.240000000001s)]
*  It's happened to me twice. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4490.72s)]
*  So the fact that these things can happen and then the attack vectors get incrementally [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4493.72s)]
*  more and more sophisticated, it used to be that there was a PDF payload. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4499.84s)]
*  Then there can just be an image payload. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4504.04s)]
*  Now it's any payload. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4505.84s)]
*  Right. And you don't even have to click to open it. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4508.4400000000005s)]
*  And all of a sudden they just root your phone. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4510.04s)]
*  So these are extremely sophisticated mechanisms that are enabled by a very few, very [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4512.6s)]
*  talented people, talented, I'll put in quotes. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4518.8s)]
*  But when those talented people work on the wrong side, you have to act. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4522.08s)]
*  So open sourcing it won't solve this. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4525.64s)]
*  These these exploits are known to a few. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4527.76s)]
*  And I think that if it's known to the NSA, this is probably what was disclosed to folks [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4531.6s)]
*  under confidentiality that caused them to get to this conclusion. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4536.0s)]
*  I think people just need to wake up and realize the Chinese government does not have [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4538.6s)]
*  Americans best interests at heart. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4542.56s)]
*  I mean, there is no concept of reciprocity, as you mentioned, Mark. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4544.68s)]
*  That's the number one reason to do this. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4550.12s)]
*  Number two, what you pointed out your mouth with security. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4551.84s)]
*  And if you think about the two biggest imports from China right now, it's fentanyl and [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4554.6s)]
*  TikTok. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4559.360000000001s)]
*  They here's what I will want to make us addicted. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4560.2s)]
*  They want to impact our society. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4562.36s)]
*  They want to divide us. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4564.68s)]
*  This is a massive psyops that's going on. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4566.12s)]
*  It is a psyops and it is a spyware and it's been proven. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4570.16s)]
*  They spied on journalists. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4573.0s)]
*  These are bad actors. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4574.56s)]
*  It has to go. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4575.68s)]
*  I was super excited when I saw that there was the potential that X would take over [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4576.64s)]
*  TikTok. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4582.16s)]
*  And the reason I say that is I do think that if you can take the video content of [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4582.92s)]
*  TikTok and the graph of creators, but have a different app and a different substrate [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4589.64s)]
*  be the delivery mechanism where you know that it's much safer and it's governed by an [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4597.400000000001s)]
*  American, that to me would be the compromise. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4601.320000000001s)]
*  So I think the app should go away. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4604.56s)]
*  But if you can somehow give creators a path to sort of like restart their content [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4607.4400000000005s)]
*  creating capabilities on X, I think that that's actually a pretty good one. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4612.76s)]
*  You guys notice in the app Freeberg that the left hand tab, because you have following [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4616.5599999999995s)]
*  shop and for you, they had a left hand tab all the way over that stem and it's just [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4621.92s)]
*  science, technology, engineering and math content. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4627.5599999999995s)]
*  I've not noticed that. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4631.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4632.64s)]
*  Take a look. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4633.16s)]
*  I don't know if it's just mine and they're micro targeting me because they know I'm [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4633.72s)]
*  such a fan of STEM, but I think it's for everybody. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4636.32s)]
*  Any thoughts, Dave, as we wrap on the TikTok? [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4640.0s)]
*  Seems like they're going to strike a deal. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4642.76s)]
*  Chuck Schumer today is calling for a delay in the ban. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4645.280000000001s)]
*  I'm sure by the time this episode airs, something will have been worked out to create [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4648.240000000001s)]
*  some space for them to get a deal done. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4652.04s)]
*  But I think they want to get a deal done and keep TikTok active in the U.S. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4653.8s)]
*  Seems like both the Dems and the Republicans are pushing for it. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4657.04s)]
*  So this kind of also leads to what I think will be. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4659.64s)]
*  The grand deal with China, which I think will happen in the first six months of the [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4664.6s)]
*  Trump administration, I'm obviously speculating, but it feels like there's going to [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4667.8s)]
*  be some work out here. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4672.44s)]
*  China's like in a lot of economic distress. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4674.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know if you guys have followed much on the stories of the deflationary [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4677.5199999999995s)]
*  challenges that China is dealing with. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4681.759999999999s)]
*  Chinese bonds are trading at a below 2% yield now, which is kind of unprecedented. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4683.32s)]
*  And there's this real concern that China is in a very significant economic [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4689.24s)]
*  deflationary spiral. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4693.0s)]
*  So they're in a very weakened position economically at the moment. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4694.48s)]
*  The United States seems to be in a position of strength. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4698.16s)]
*  And I would imagine just given the rhetoric that this administration may try to work [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4701.72s)]
*  out again, some deal that's going to provide access to the Chinese market in exchange [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4707.4s)]
*  for the U.S. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4711.8s)]
*  minimizing the tariff effect on Chinese importers to the U.S. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4713.04s)]
*  So there could be, I think, something that eases the tension with China and creates [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4716.24s)]
*  mutual economic value in the first six months of the administration. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4723.48s)]
*  We'll see. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4728.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, it's a great point. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4729.32s)]
*  Trump is a great negotiator. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4730.36s)]
*  It's probably his greatest strength and he's great at saber rattling. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4731.839999999999s)]
*  And we're strong. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4734.639999999999s)]
*  They're weak right now. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4735.839999999999s)]
*  A grand deal could be an awesome outcome. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4737.2s)]
*  I think this was my one of my this was my contrarian prediction, I think. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4739.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, no, this was my stock. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4742.92s)]
*  This was my stock prediction. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4744.04s)]
*  Yeah, this was like my Chinese tech stocks. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4745.16s)]
*  Yeah, same. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4747.36s)]
*  I I've been loading up on Alibaba a couple of Chinese names with the same bet. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4748.48s)]
*  Hey, guys, here's a chart for you. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4755.679999999999s)]
*  So companies are not hiring as many MBAs. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4757.56s)]
*  This is a recent spike in unemployment among MBAs from top business schools like [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4762.8s)]
*  Harvard, MIT and Stanford. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4768.84s)]
*  I'm not sure. I think. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4771.160000000001s)]
*  Pinkus, did you go to Harvard for your MBA? [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4772.4800000000005s)]
*  Guilty. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4775.160000000001s)]
*  Guilty. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4776.320000000001s)]
*  So and you've also stopped working. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4777.52s)]
*  So you're represented here on the chart. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4779.76s)]
*  Yeah, I still have a job. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4781.68s)]
*  I used to work. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4783.160000000001s)]
*  What are your thoughts on this? [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4785.080000000001s)]
*  Are MBAs out of vogue? [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4786.56s)]
*  Are they opting out? [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4788.160000000001s)]
*  What's your theory here? [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4789.080000000001s)]
*  Well, so, yes, I went there. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4790.4800000000005s)]
*  I would say that. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4792.56s)]
*  That my all the learning that's helped me in my career started later after I got out. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4795.56s)]
*  My first product management job was really when I started learning things that are useful [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4802.68s)]
*  to me today. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4808.360000000001s)]
*  I think being there, I learned a lot about like how to sell to corporate America and [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4809.88s)]
*  some how do they think kind of things. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4814.32s)]
*  And then I've gone back to HBS for decades trying to recruit from there. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4818.0s)]
*  And in the beginning, they would tell me the kids would when I had support dot com and [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4822.68s)]
*  it was going to go public, they said, I'd have to be a vice president and own 3 percent [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4827.36s)]
*  of the company to take a job with a startup like you. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4831.5199999999995s)]
*  And this was just before the company went public. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4834.32s)]
*  There was a little bit of a renaissance period where some HBS people were excited to join [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4837.36s)]
*  Zynga, probably because they thought it was going public, but they were a little more [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4841.96s)]
*  risk on at that point. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4845.2s)]
*  And now everyone's open to jobs. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4846.76s)]
*  My take is that there's this fundamental imbalance that people go and get an MBA [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4851.36s)]
*  because they're de-risking their career. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4858.4800000000005s)]
*  You go to HBS or Stanford and you're guaranteed this high salary and this kind of great [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4860.8s)]
*  job for life. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4867.52s)]
*  So the reason to go there is to take the risk off. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4868.759999999999s)]
*  That's in fundamental opposition to where we are in our economy, in my opinion today, [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4873.28s)]
*  or where the most interesting sectors are. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4879.2s)]
*  Those kinds of jobs have dried up and the kinds of jobs that I think should be interesting [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4880.799999999999s)]
*  to MBAs are more like go find a Y Combinator company and join a founding team as the [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4887.92s)]
*  business person or whatever. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4895.24s)]
*  And these people are smart and qualified, but there's this mismatch that they are [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4897.0s)]
*  fundamentally risk averse. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4902.12s)]
*  And so they're not. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4904.08s)]
*  So it says they haven't found jobs. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4905.52s)]
*  Part of it is I think they're going to they're going to have to fall further or this might [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4908.0s)]
*  happen so that a part of it they have maybe debt or they have to pay back this expensive [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4913.16s)]
*  degree. But I think that they've got to get to a point like I was when I started my first [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4918.08s)]
*  company, Freeloader, I happily had very little to no opportunity costs because I had [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4923.64s)]
*  torched my career by that point, torched my resume. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4928.320000000001s)]
*  I was fired or asked to leave every job. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4931.92s)]
*  And so there was kind of no turning back. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4935.280000000001s)]
*  So can you imagine being Mark Pinkes' boss? [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4937.84s)]
*  I mean, that's almost as hard as being Tramont's. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4941.76s)]
*  Yeah, I always say I'm a great team player as long as I'm running the team. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4944.72s)]
*  So right. Great quarterback. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4948.56s)]
*  Yeah. But yeah, so I had no opportunity cost when I started my first company, which looked [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4950.24s)]
*  like it didn't have a chance in hell, you know, of ever making it. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4956.32s)]
*  So you probably thought so, too, then about my company. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4959.84s)]
*  But so now the question is maybe what's going to happen is we're going to get a new [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4962.8s)]
*  equilibrium where these the opportunities for these people start to come down, the [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4967.12s)]
*  guaranteed opportunities and a consulting firms, right? [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4971.52s)]
*  They all go to McKinsey, Boston Consult Group, whatever. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4975.24s)]
*  Even I just the class I taught on Monday at Stanford, they said everyone wants a job [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4977.84s)]
*  at Meta or Google and that's the get rich quick place. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4983.24s)]
*  And it's I don't even think that's necessarily true anymore. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4987.0s)]
*  And they can't get those jobs because those companies are now trying to get rid of [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4990.2s)]
*  middle management. So those jobs have dried up. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4993.96s)]
*  You know, part of what's in this data probably also is a lot of these people aren't [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=4997.56s)]
*  taking jobs. They're not finding jobs that meet this high expectation for pay and [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5002.96s)]
*  opportunity. So I think it's a I think it's a good thing. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5009.2s)]
*  It also probably is going to reduce the demand to go into these MBA programs, because [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5013.12s)]
*  if you're thinking, well, that's not going to be my risk off trade and I'm not going [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5018.04s)]
*  I'm not going to be guaranteed. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5022.84s)]
*  Hundred percent. So why go in the first place? [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5024.04s)]
*  And I would advise people today, you know, to depending on what industry I'm [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5026.16s)]
*  biased by, I'd say go get a product management job somewhere and make enough that [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5031.24s)]
*  you can afford to live on it. And that's going to be the beginning of learning. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5036.28s)]
*  I think these chamoff. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5039.8s)]
*  What are these things called when these MBAs graduate? [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5041.88s)]
*  They raise a bunch of money to go buy some real fun. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5044.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's not happening anymore. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5047.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that was like the none of them made money. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5049.76s)]
*  None of them made money. Turns out these MBAs don't know what they're doing. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5052.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, yeah. So when they take over the business run by a family and some matriarch or [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5056.16s)]
*  50 years to get it to 25,000,000. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5060.92s)]
*  I don't know. There's that there's that one deal out of Stanford GSB. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5063.36s)]
*  The guy founded Asurion, which is like, you know, 10. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5066.92s)]
*  It's that guy would have founded that company outside of Stanford. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5071.4s)]
*  He could have gone to Timbuktu dot com University, Disgraciad State, and he would [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5075.24s)]
*  have been fine. That speaks to more about the cleverness of that one individual, not [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5079.88s)]
*  the ninety nine thousand other deals that have been done. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5086.44s)]
*  Let me say something that builds on what Pinkus was saying, which is I think that [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5089.0s)]
*  this is a interesting window into the future of AI in the sense that I think what [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5093.52s)]
*  companies are internalizing slowly, that the first place that AI [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5099.32s)]
*  disintermediates is actually middle management. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5104.88s)]
*  You thought that it was the customer support person. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5108.4400000000005s)]
*  Maybe you thought it was the engineer. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5111.0s)]
*  Maybe you thought it was the designer. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5113.12s)]
*  Maybe you thought it was the product manager. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5114.68s)]
*  I think those are less true. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5116.400000000001s)]
*  I think it's the middle manager. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5118.52s)]
*  It's the functionary that basically is acting as essentially cartilage. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5120.0s)]
*  Inside of this organization has less and less to do in a place where AI enabled [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5126.68s)]
*  systems are making a lot of decisions on behalf of businesses. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5133.88s)]
*  And if you take a step back, how did that evolve? [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5139.280000000001s)]
*  Well, it started because of what I mentioned a couple of weeks ago. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5142.64s)]
*  What the software industrial complex will really be known for after it is [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5146.8s)]
*  dismantled and gone is that it created all of these really dysfunctional [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5151.28s)]
*  org charts in a company. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5158.599999999999s)]
*  Meaning when you are a system of record that sells something, let's make it up. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5160.88s)]
*  Hey, I'm the best general ledger software. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5166.28s)]
*  Okay. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5169.92s)]
*  And a CEO says, great, implement that. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5170.2s)]
*  And then all of a sudden it's like, well, you're going to need a CFO. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5172.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5175.84s)]
*  But then the CFO comes to you and says, well, you actually need a head of FP&A [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5176.52s)]
*  ahead of this, ahead of that, ahead of the other thing. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5180.8s)]
*  Then the CEO says, okay, then those people hire. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5183.360000000001s)]
*  And what happens is the software sprawl is really what created those jobs. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5186.240000000001s)]
*  Somebody else says, here's a customer relationship management thing. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5190.96s)]
*  Okay, great. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5195.16s)]
*  So then you hire a CMO and a CRO. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5195.72s)]
*  Those people build infrastructure. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5199.08s)]
*  So my premise about this is if you look inside of any org chart of any company, [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5200.6s)]
*  you can map those jobs to some clunky old piece of software that was sold to them. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5206.96s)]
*  Maybe it was 10 years ago, maybe it was 20 years ago, but that's why orgs are this [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5212.200000000001s)]
*  bulky. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5217.240000000001s)]
*  And now when you have all of these new next gen businesses that are ripping all [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5218.68s)]
*  of that software out, the middle management layers that used to manage that [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5223.240000000001s)]
*  software are no longer necessary. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5227.080000000001s)]
*  That's why you're not hiring MBAs. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5228.68s)]
*  And I think that this trend is only going to grow. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5230.56s)]
*  So I don't think that this is a commentary on the people. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5234.0s)]
*  The people are probably quite smart. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5236.88s)]
*  But I do think that this is a warning sign that people should not go and pursue these [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5239.320000000001s)]
*  degrees because I think, as Pinka said, you're not taking the trade of least [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5242.8s)]
*  volatility. You're actually taking on a lot more volatility than you probably thought [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5247.4400000000005s)]
*  you shouldn't be taking on by going to a place like Harvard or Stanford. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5251.160000000001s)]
*  Freebert, any thoughts as we wrap here about this MBA chart? [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5255.64s)]
*  The collapse of the MBA program could be the beginning of the unwinding of the [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5259.5199999999995s)]
*  higher education market. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5264.44s)]
*  Why? [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5267.719999999999s)]
*  Same word. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5268.0s)]
*  I think this is the easiest one to discard first in an age of AI and automation and [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5270.0s)]
*  self-learning. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5277.5599999999995s)]
*  And I think that, I mean, I've been thinking a lot about, I've, I've young kids, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5278.599999999999s)]
*  right? [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5284.599999999999s)]
*  So my kid, my oldest kid is seven years old. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5284.84s)]
*  I had to think about that for a sec. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5288.68s)]
*  So many kids now. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5290.68s)]
*  And, [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5291.84s)]
*  Isn't it great, by the way, I go through this all, I don't know. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5293.76s)]
*  I have to go, I have to like, what's my kid's birthday? [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5296.400000000001s)]
*  Jamal has like a busload of children. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5298.68s)]
*  When you have five, you can't. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5300.24s)]
*  So I have a fifth. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5302.64s)]
*  Wait, five and you're at four days? [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5303.360000000001s)]
*  I have five. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5306.0s)]
*  I can't, I have to really think about all the birthdays. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5306.84s)]
*  But yeah, I would say, I think a lot about whether or not it makes sense for my kids [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5310.400000000001s)]
*  to go to undergrad. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5315.4800000000005s)]
*  And I think like about going to classes as an undergrad, I certainly, there's the [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5317.12s)]
*  social experience and I learned a lot in, you know, kind of working at a lab when I [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5321.08s)]
*  was there and doing other stuff. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5326.24s)]
*  But those were like on the job experiences. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5328.639999999999s)]
*  I do think that the social experience and the practical experience can be gotten [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5331.32s)]
*  outside of the college infrastructure, this educational infrastructure. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5337.16s)]
*  Oh, I cannot tell you guys how much time I just had a great idea. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5342.92s)]
*  I just had the best idea ever. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5346.5599999999995s)]
*  The all in MBA. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5348.4s)]
*  Let's start our own MBA program. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5350.0s)]
*  I think that's the whole point is people should get back to kind of an apprenticeship [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5352.4s)]
*  type model or a self-learning model. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5355.88s)]
*  Everyone's got their own personal tutor now. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5357.72s)]
*  That's what I think people aren't realizing is anything you want to learn with AI. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5359.5199999999995s)]
*  And I heard about what Johnny Ive has done with his kids. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5364.8s)]
*  I'm pretty sure they skip college and they just went to work directly with him and his [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5368.599999999999s)]
*  design firm. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5374.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5375.84s)]
*  I'm like, I'm taking him out to lunch because I want to interview him. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5376.240000000001s)]
*  But I think that's such an interesting way. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5378.88s)]
*  Your daughters and my daughters want to start a podcast together. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5382.360000000001s)]
*  Pink is what they want to name it. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5385.84s)]
*  Oh, no, I don't. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5388.92s)]
*  I don't know if I should say it. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5390.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5391.88s)]
*  I didn't hear the name. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5392.280000000001s)]
*  I think your mom's daughter is in on this as well. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5393.280000000001s)]
*  I think it was another friend's child who came up with the name. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5396.12s)]
*  They want to call it the nepo pod. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5399.76s)]
*  I'm here for it. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5401.24s)]
*  No, I think Freeberg nailed it on this one because I just had a Ruch Selvin, who is the [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5402.08s)]
*  PM at Google doing deep research on this week in startups yesterday. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5408.84s)]
*  And this product is nuts. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5412.88s)]
*  And they designed it to basically be one of these like million dollar or five million [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5415.04s)]
*  dollar reports you pay for from these consulting firms that MBA is right. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5420.44s)]
*  And it does a big job. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5425.44s)]
*  It's more accurate. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5426.84s)]
*  It's done in five to 10 minutes. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5428.0s)]
*  This thing fires off. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5430.320000000001s)]
*  Have you used deep research at Mark? [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5431.88s)]
*  No, I keep hearing you talking about it. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5434.52s)]
*  And I'm such an idiot about this stuff. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5436.400000000001s)]
*  It's on the desktop. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5438.68s)]
*  You can't use the mobile and then I ask Gemini how to use it. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5439.68s)]
*  And it's only a good time and you have to pay 20 bucks for it. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5444.2s)]
*  And then Grok 2.0 is doing something similar. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5446.6s)]
*  When you put your query in, you can't use the mobile. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5449.12s)]
*  You can't use the mobile. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5451.56s)]
*  You can't use the mobile. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5452.56s)]
*  You can't use the mobile. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5453.56s)]
*  It's something similar. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5454.6s)]
*  When you put your query in, it decides like all the second level queries that would be [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5455.6s)]
*  asked. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5459.8s)]
*  Then it checks its work. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5460.8s)]
*  So it's firing off a spider that goes and crawls 150 pages in real time. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5462.280000000001s)]
*  Then it asks questions about the data. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5467.72s)]
*  Then it says, what's missing from this? [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5469.160000000001s)]
*  So all the questions you would get from your manager, if you were working at Boston Consulting [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5471.280000000001s)]
*  Group where they tell some young MBA, hey, you missed this, you missed this. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5474.96s)]
*  Can you double check this? [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5478.780000000001s)]
*  Can you find double click on this? [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5479.780000000001s)]
*  It goes and does those follow up questions. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5482.2s)]
*  And now you can do a cron job where you can say, take my research and every week do a [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5485.76s)]
*  update on it and fill in information and tell me the differences. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5492.5199999999995s)]
*  Instead of just buying a Boston Consulting or McKinsey or whatever report, you build [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5495.679999999999s)]
*  it and then have it auto and the deep research is coming out. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5500.639999999999s)]
*  This thing's going to automatically refresh it in your Google Docs and then update you [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5503.679999999999s)]
*  on what's been changed. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5507.62s)]
*  And Grok is doing it as well, except Grok has all the tweets. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5510.36s)]
*  So when you use Grok now, did you see now at the top of the page it says, and I think [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5513.44s)]
*  it's only in the Grok app, the dedicated app they just launched last week, it shows you [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5517.56s)]
*  all the tweets and it shows you all the web pages that it indexed for that query. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5522.2s)]
*  So this is like putting somebody on a week long research project. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5528.44s)]
*  And like I said, it takes between five and 10 minutes to do this and it costs a massive [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5532.28s)]
*  amount of server capacity to do these real time, you know, two, 300 queries are occurring [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5536.4s)]
*  behind your one. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5541.96s)]
*  It's nuts. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5543.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know if you guys have been using advanced voice on chat GPT much or do you guys use [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5544.5599999999995s)]
*  the voice? [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5549.44s)]
*  And so lately, anytime I kind of have come across an interesting topic, I end up finding [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5550.679999999999s)]
*  that I just talked to chat GPT for like an hour or two and I'll be like in my car, like [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5555.799999999999s)]
*  when I'm driving to work or going to a meeting or I go for like a walk down to the coffee [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5560.2s)]
*  shop, I'm like, OK, so tell me about like what happened during the ice age with respect [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5565.48s)]
*  to how quickly sea levels receded. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5571.32s)]
*  And I start to gather and like it's basically like your own personal tutor. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5573.5599999999995s)]
*  I finally have a best friend, Mark. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5577.919999999999s)]
*  And I think that basically you end up seeing a future where if people are put into almost [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5581.16s)]
*  like the real world becomes the lab environment that is created in a very short window and [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5588.5199999999995s)]
*  small amount of space in a college environment where you're like in some like applied [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5593.76s)]
*  scape that applied scape basically becomes the real world. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5599.4800000000005s)]
*  And you've got your college in your ear. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5604.04s)]
*  You've basically got your tutors, your educational experience, your capabilities that you're [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5606.280000000001s)]
*  learning and you learn more in real time. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5610.2s)]
*  And I think that that's what AI is going to take us to, which is basically going to [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5612.68s)]
*  destroy much of the value of higher education. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5615.8s)]
*  And I think that this MBA piece is probably just the first step of many. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5618.52s)]
*  That's going to ultimately erode the value of education. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5622.96s)]
*  Did you guys see that fleshlight that can actually be synced to a video you're watching? [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5626.04s)]
*  I see you know, that's pretty crazy. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5631.2s)]
*  Can we go to the UFOs instead of sex toys? [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5635.28s)]
*  We get it. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5638.44s)]
*  Or show us the video. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5639.32s)]
*  Show us the video. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5640.24s)]
*  No, it's also you get one. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5640.88s)]
*  It's all about to show us from his hidden folder. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5644.32s)]
*  I saw it on X. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5648.04s)]
*  It was like a summary of like the top 10 things from CES. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5648.84s)]
*  And it was a fleshlight that would gyrate based on the actual contortions in the video. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5653.32s)]
*  Which was using AI. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5660.2s)]
*  You know what I'm saying in one of Chamath's guest rooms tonight? [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5661.2s)]
*  I'm a little nervous. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5662.400000000001s)]
*  It's interesting, Pinkus. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5663.52s)]
*  You get to see two different things here. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5664.72s)]
*  When AI comes up as a topic, Freiburg finally has a best friend and Chamath finally has a [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5666.8s)]
*  lover who will do exactly what he tells it to. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5672.24s)]
*  This was absolutely perfect. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5675.12s)]
*  So Mark, lately we've been talking to all the guests about UFOs and UAPs. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5677.52s)]
*  Welcome to Conspiracy Coin. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5682.4400000000005s)]
*  You have a point of view on UFO UAP phenomena? [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5683.72s)]
*  I do. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5688.08s)]
*  And I guess everyone else has too. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5690.6s)]
*  So I won't be that weird and outlier. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5693.400000000001s)]
*  So first of all, I'll just say I don't believe in UAPs, UFOs, and I don't not believe in them. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5695.68s)]
*  I'm just curious about it. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5701.88s)]
*  And I've I've had this theory that something is going to happen, that we're going to break [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5703.56s)]
*  our current understanding of physics theory and our physics laws. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5708.4400000000005s)]
*  And so I've been looking for that moment. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5713.76s)]
*  And one of those is around the UAPs. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5716.360000000001s)]
*  So I've been more and more curious and digging more and more. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5720.080000000001s)]
*  And I started working with a friend who made the movie Icarus on the idea of like a Netflix [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5722.88s)]
*  docu-series. I thought it should be funny and have somebody like a Larry David kind of [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5729.52s)]
*  character narrating it. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5734.200000000001s)]
*  But he said maybe maybe he came back to me. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5735.68s)]
*  He's making a documentary about fentanyl crisis and how it China documented how China has [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5738.72s)]
*  dumped it here. And he said, you've got to meet with me and this guy. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5744.8s)]
*  I came while he was working on that, he was interviewing a former DOD contractor who had [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5749.6s)]
*  worked for them for decades and said, you know, I've got a lot on fentanyl, but I have this [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5755.56s)]
*  whole other thing to show you about these UAPs. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5759.4s)]
*  And he he'll just tell you his claim, his claim. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5764.04s)]
*  So they came and met with me and we had to meet outside and put our phones in fairway [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5767.28s)]
*  bags, fair day bags. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5772.4s)]
*  So it was a good setup. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5775.639999999999s)]
*  It's nothing else. And he said he claimed that in doing running these war games for the [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5778.28s)]
*  Defense Department, it inadvertently was summoning these UAPs, these drones. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5785.28s)]
*  And he had tons and tons of video of it and classified them. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5792.12s)]
*  I'm just telling you what he told me. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5795.96s)]
*  Let me guess the drone, all the drone videos look like they were shot on an 8 millimeter [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5797.36s)]
*  1968 camera. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5802.12s)]
*  Wait, hold on, hold on, Jason. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5803.48s)]
*  Mark, just explain this. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5804.88s)]
*  So the United States is simulating war games. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5806.24s)]
*  Yeah. And what is it doing exactly that's causing these drones to show up? [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5811.16s)]
*  He did not tell me what were the games, what were the exact triggers that. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5815.759999999999s)]
*  But he said different things would trigger a different one and he classified them. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5822.92s)]
*  And he said some of them were aggressive from an electronics and would take out electronics [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5827.84s)]
*  and communications. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5834.28s)]
*  And he so he was interested and my friend was interested in saying, OK, can you put [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5836.36s)]
*  up a couple of people a million and a half dollars to recreate this and film this? [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5842.44s)]
*  And I thought about it, even had him go meet with Reed. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5849.04s)]
*  And it didn't move quickly. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5854.5599999999995s)]
*  And then he went dark on us and stopped responding. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5856.639999999999s)]
*  And then some friends of mine went to a gathering at and what they it was on multiple [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5861.16s)]
*  things related to this. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5870.28s)]
*  And they said that this guy was there and that he summoned one of these. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5871.719999999999s)]
*  They kind of said it looked like a large drone. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5876.4s)]
*  And my friends showed me some pictures that they took, which were really it was at night [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5879.5599999999995s)]
*  and they were really great. Stop, come on, stop. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5883.639999999999s)]
*  I'm not making this up. I'm just telling you just one piece of advice with this documentary [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5885.96s)]
*  film stuff. You know how to make one hundred million dollars in documentary films, right, [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5890.2s)]
*  Pinkus? Yes, start with a billion. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5893.679999999999s)]
*  Start with a billion. You're the mark in all of this. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5895.8s)]
*  You're just a mark. This guy needs a million dollars to finish his house or something in [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5899.16s)]
*  Topanga Canyon. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5903.2s)]
*  Fair. And you're the way to do it. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5904.56s)]
*  I didn't find it. You're the mark. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5906.68s)]
*  I didn't find it. OK, good. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5908.28s)]
*  So all I'm saying is that I think that there's a possibility that there is some kind of [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5910.2s)]
*  drone that's getting that that is showing up. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5915.96s)]
*  And I'm not saying it's even from, you know, from non-human making. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5920.360000000001s)]
*  I believe it. I believe it. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5925.8s)]
*  I am looking, I'll be honest, because I am looking for a reason to believe in this. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5927.12s)]
*  I'll be honest. Like, I know my bias. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5931.32s)]
*  I am very sympathetic when I hear these stories. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5933.8s)]
*  I listen way too long, you know, to the podcasts on this stuff. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5937.44s)]
*  Are you donating to Alex Jones? [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5942.44s)]
*  No, but I know. But I I. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5944.5199999999995s)]
*  OK, how about this? Are we convinced that there has been absolutely zero unidentified [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5948.28s)]
*  object inside some vault buried deep somewhere? [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5956.48s)]
*  In either the US or national state government, are we guaranteed that the odds of that [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5963.32s)]
*  are zero? And I say no, it's not. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5968.599999999999s)]
*  Let's do our first. What is it? [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5971.36s)]
*  Fermi paradox. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5973.32s)]
*  Free bird Fermi paradox. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5975.5199999999995s)]
*  Why aren't the if there if there are aliens, why haven't we seen them quick around? [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5977.08s)]
*  I'm not I'm not. I'm not saying I'm saying there is a UAP that is that is. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5982.28s)]
*  It's a UAP that has been unidentified that is sitting inside some vault somewhere in [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5986.5599999999995s)]
*  a state government in the world. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5990.96s)]
*  So your position is the aliens have come. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5992.879999999999s)]
*  No, stop saying aliens. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5996.36s)]
*  You but you make the whole thing seem ridiculous when you say aliens. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=5997.639999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying that I'm saying visitors from another planet. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=6002.2s)]
*  No, stop with the visitors. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=6004.92s)]
*  Just let's just put it this way. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=6006.92s)]
*  A vehicle. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=6008.599999999999s)]
*  That does not have anything inside it. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=6010.719999999999s)]
*  A vehicle could be autonomous and unmanned. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=6012.2s)]
*  Are the odds exactly zero? [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=6014.599999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=6017.4s)]
*  But with billions of planets, it would, you know, logic would make you think that one [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=6020.16s)]
*  has come already, right? [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=6026.2s)]
*  That's what this billions of inhabitable planets and species out there, there must have [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=6028.16s)]
*  somebody must be ahead of us. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=6032.2s)]
*  But the other conclusion of Fermi's paradox is we statistically are the highest a society [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=6033.92s)]
*  has ever gotten. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=6040.68s)]
*  And we have yet to send our probes out to the rest of the universe, although we have [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=6041.96s)]
*  sent probes freeburg to Uranus. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=6047.56s)]
*  All right, everybody, thanks for tuning in. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ35G6XI8Uw&t=6050.400000000001s)]
