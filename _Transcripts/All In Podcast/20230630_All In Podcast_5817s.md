*  Thus syndicate comm yeah, thank you. You've been doing you said five shows a week lately your voice is shot [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=125.86000000000001s)]
*  I your voice is starting to go. So I asked you if you'd moderate and you thankfully said yes, I've got the energy [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=132.62s)]
*  I missed last week. I enjoyed listening to you guys with BG great episode. Sorry, I couldn't join [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=139.02s)]
*  But let's kick it off. That's funny. I still watch the episode that I missed [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=144.78s)]
*  Not interested. He's like I'm not on the show. I'm not interested. I don't have time to participate [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=149.26s)]
*  I don't only have time to watch it. The truth is sex [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=154.26s)]
*  Why don't you admit to everyone that where you're in a show you probably watch it four or five times [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=157.26s)]
*  All right, so let's kick this off [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=162.98s)]
*  Obviously you guys recorded right before the Wagner group [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=165.78s)]
*  Attempted coup or potential coup or theorized coup began last week [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=170.54s)]
*  So sacks you kind of sent out a text saying the show is already stale because you know kind of missed that that news cycle [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=175.18s)]
*  By publishing right after it started, but you recorded right before so let's do [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=182.22s)]
*  Just a quick recap of what happened with Russia [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=188.7s)]
*  Ukraine and particularly its Wagner Wagner group rebellion [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=193.34s)]
*  Last Friday the Wagner group, which is a Russian paramilitary organization led by Evgeny Prigozhin [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=197.34s)]
*  Launched what seemed like an armed insurrection against Russia Wagner had occupied portions of Rostov on dawn a city of over a million people [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=203.82s)]
*  A regional capital and headquarters of Russia's Southern Military District [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=210.88s)]
*  before setting off towards Moscow and then abruptly stopping I think about 200 kilometers before reaching Moscow City at that point there was [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=214.85999999999999s)]
*  Supposedly a negotiation the president of Belarus got involved and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=225.3s)]
*  Prigozhin decided to step down [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=231.34s)]
*  Putin said I'm not going to persecute or I'm not going to prosecute you for these crimes [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=233.66000000000003s)]
*  He was given immunity and it was announced that all the members of the Wagner group [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=237.5s)]
*  Were given the option of returning home or joining the Russian military and the Wagner group was going to be just dissolved [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=243.18s)]
*  Sacks maybe you can kind of give us your summary of the events that took place [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=249.86s)]
*  And then we'll talk a little bit about the interpretation of what we think this means for the conflict in Ukraine [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=254.86s)]
*  Well, you're right that this rebellion [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=260.46000000000004s)]
*  Took place just after we dropped our last episode [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=263.3s)]
*  and so everybody both on Twitter and in the comments was dunking on me for my take on last week's episode that the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=266.66s)]
*  Much hyped Ukrainian counter-offensive was was not succeeding that it was in fact failing [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=274.26s)]
*  I think there's abundant evidence for that which hasn't changed even CNN [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=279.66s)]
*  Had written an article basically supporting the idea that the counter-offensive was not living up to what had been promised [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=283.94s)]
*  and so everyone was in the comments saying that my take had basically aged like milk and [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=289.86s)]
*  This armed rebellion or mutiny by Prigozhin was evidence that the Russian regime was about to collapse that Russia was in [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=295.1s)]
*  fact on the verge of [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=302.86s)]
*  Civil war and you saw the exact same people who had oversold the counter-offensive now overselling this [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=305.22s)]
*  Mutiny as something that would bring down the Russian [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=311.94s)]
*  Regime and and the war and of course that that did not happen [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=315.42s)]
*  It was certainly a highly unusual event [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=318.94s)]
*  I've read takes now from every different corner of the internet about what it was and what took place you have people speculating that this [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=321.58000000000004s)]
*  Was all staged. I do not believe that I do believe that it was an [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=327.58000000000004s)]
*  Insurrection or mutiny by Prigozhin [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=332.02000000000004s)]
*  I think the trigger for it was the fact that his Wagner organization was being merged in [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=333.58000000000004s)]
*  With the Ministry of Defense and the regular Russian army and his men were all being made to sign [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=339.98s)]
*  Contracts with the Ministry of Defense that would have resulted in a giant loss of income and status for Prigozhin [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=345.06s)]
*  Simultaneously for months now. He's been criticizing the Ministry of Defense specifically the the Minister of Defense Shoigu and the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=352.5s)]
*  Chief General of the General Staff [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=360.5s)]
*  Durasimov so he's been vocally critical of them and I think that this basically erupted into a [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=363.74s)]
*  Mutiny by him where he basically tried to leverage his position. Like you said he marched [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=370.98s)]
*  What they now think are about 8,000 men, which is about a quarter of Wagner into Rostov on Don [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=377.74s)]
*  He then took the ministry headquarters and sent about 3,000 of his men on a convoy to Moscow [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=384.1s)]
*  I think that although this is probably best described as a mutiny [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=389.9s)]
*  I think that it did have coup optionality to it. I think that Prigozhin [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=394.14s)]
*  Was seeking to find out how much support Putin had and who might join him and he had put out a number of statements [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=399.61999999999995s)]
*  That I think from the Russian regime's point of view could be described as seditious [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=407.17999999999995s)]
*  That morning and there's a lot of evidence that he staged this attack on his base [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=411.5s)]
*  He claimed that there was a missile attack by the Ministry of Defense and that's what launched this March for justice and in his comments [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=416.7s)]
*  He was careful not to criticize Putin directly [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=424.62s)]
*  But he had a lot to say about ministry defense and the overall conduct of the war and it was I think harshly critical [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=427.46s)]
*  Indirectly of Putin and I think he was looking to see who might support him [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=434.06s)]
*  And what happened is that on the way to Moscow during this convoy? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=438.47999999999996s)]
*  Nobody supported him. In fact, all the statements came out from the other generals including Sir Viken [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=443.46s)]
*  including all the regional governors of [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=450.38s)]
*  members of the Duma and other important figures in Russian society and there wasn't a single person willing to publicly support [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=453.41999999999996s)]
*  Prigozhin and that's when Putin went on TV called this basically an act of treason and a stab in the back [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=460.82s)]
*  And at that point I think [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=465.97999999999996s)]
*  Prigozhin's options were pretty limited and he basically took a deal [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=468.26s)]
*  That was broker by Lukashenko in which he would go into exile in [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=472.38s)]
*  Belarus [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=477.21999999999997s)]
*  In exchange for basically being allowed to live [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=478.26s)]
*  That was basically the deal that was ultimately cut and so I think where things stand today [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=481.26s)]
*  Is that although I think this was an embarrassment and a black eye for the Russian regime [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=485.7s)]
*  it never looks good for regime to have any kind of mutiny or insurrection and [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=491.17999999999995s)]
*  And I think that it does raise questions that Putin's now gonna have to answer to his various allies and supporters about how stable his regime is [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=497.62s)]
*  I think ultimately Putin has ended up in a place of consolidating [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=505.7s)]
*  Russian society behind him. Like I said, there were no power centers that supported this mutiny [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=510.97999999999996s)]
*  They all rally to Putin's defense and the people of Russia [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=516.9399999999999s)]
*  Even though Prigozhin is a popular figure being kind of a war hero from the Battle of Bakhmut [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=520.22s)]
*  The Russian society supported Putin I think he's at something like 80% poll numbers. So I think where things fall [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=525.2199999999999s)]
*  Well, like Levada Center, which is an independent polling agency, for example [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=533.26s)]
*  These are not the Russian regime's own numbers and when I told numbers, would you say in a poll that you don't support Putin? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=537.9s)]
*  Well, I don't know how Levada Center what their methodology is [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=544.66s)]
*  But these numbers when the numbers are bad are cited by Western sources [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=548.38s)]
*  But there are other forms of evidence too. You may have seen this video that went viral over the past few days of this song [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=552.52s)]
*  That's now the number one chart buster in in Russia where it's this very patriotic Russian song [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=558.84s)]
*  Where they're basically singing I am Russian that's sort of the main chorus Nick. Can you pull up the song? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=566.0799999999999s)]
*  I'd like to see this place coming at you 95.5. I love Russia [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=570.72s)]
*  This is some serious propaganda [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=576.96s)]
*  I mean that looks like a pretty good party [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=583.24s)]
*  If you look up the the lyrics to the song the English translation of the lyrics that just a bit is I'm [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=590.3199999999999s)]
*  Basically proud to be Russian and I don't care who doesn't like it. That's basically the the lyrics of it [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=596.8s)]
*  How do you get invited to that party? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=603.1s)]
*  I got so many jokes. I'm not gonna make a you gotta be careful [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=606.1s)]
*  Folks you gotta be careful here. Why it looks like a fun party. It's a catchy song. I [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=610.62s)]
*  Mean, I love to dress up and show up. Tell me where to show up Putin [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=616.02s)]
*  I think the point here is that Russian society is united behind the state in wanting to fight this war [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=619.66s)]
*  and I think that part of the reason why [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=626.7s)]
*  Purgosians mutiny was so oversold as an imminent coup that would bring about the collapse of the Putin regime [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=629.38s)]
*  And of the Russian war effort and of their frontline is because that we since the beginning of this war [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=636.3000000000001s)]
*  We've had this narrative that if we applied enough pressure to Russia [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=641.6600000000001s)]
*  that there'd be a palace intrigue and a palace coup and [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=646.3000000000001s)]
*  that liberal forces inside of Russia would rise up and topple the dictator Putin and [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=649.82s)]
*  Basically get them out of this war and I think what's happened is fairly predictable [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=654.86s)]
*  but it's the opposite of that which is the Russian people are rallying around the flag and rallying around Putin the war leader and [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=659.5s)]
*  They are a patriotic people just like the Ukrainians and I think both these countries that both the Russians and the Ukrainians are a proud [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=665.62s)]
*  People and I think they're in a fight to the death and I think that both countries. Okay regardless is [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=673.28s)]
*  And we have basically stuck ourselves in the middle of this fight to the death between these two countries and I don't see this working out very well [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=679.6s)]
*  Okay, so look I I will make an admission. I consider myself a modestly well-read person [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=686.52s)]
*  Modestly well-informed I had never heard of the Wagner group or pregocian prior to this coup attempt last week Chema [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=692.9200000000001s)]
*  Jcal had you guys heard of this person before and [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=701.0s)]
*  The Wagner group. Yeah. Yeah [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=705.0s)]
*  Oh, well, maybe I'm an idiot or that just not interested [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=707.84s)]
*  I think what was so surprising was like how out of the blue the story seemed to be last week that [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=710.7s)]
*  There was this disagreement between this person that commanded this paramilitary organization [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=716.08s)]
*  Who then turned around against Putin and stood up against him and marched back towards Moscow and it felt to me like it came [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=721.04s)]
*  A little bit out of the blue and was such like a weird kind of shocking event [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=727.84s)]
*  Did it feel kind of like that to you guys that there was surprising instability and the surprising [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=732.4599999999999s)]
*  Potential revolution happening locally. I think stepping back here and just looking at the news cycle [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=739.0999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, I don't think many people expected this [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=744.6999999999999s)]
*  This is a wild card and so people could be humble in you know [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=747.1999999999999s)]
*  Their belief of like how much they actually understand about what's going on there [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=751.42s)]
*  The Russian soldiers are not in favor of this war. This is a war that's very unpopular in Russia [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=755.6999999999999s)]
*  Actually and for the Ukraine having been invaded by Russia they're fighting for their land and they're gonna they are much more motivated [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=760.46s)]
*  I wouldn't believe any of this propaganda, but this is a bit of a raw shock test [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=767.14s)]
*  Everybody on the left got on Twitter and said this is the end of Putin [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=770.58s)]
*  Everybody's gonna rise up in the streets and they overplayed that you know angle of the story [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=774.3000000000001s)]
*  and then of course the right or people who are [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=778.3000000000001s)]
*  Pro Russian or anti the West backing this war are gonna take the other side preberg. They're gonna take the side of [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=781.14s)]
*  You know, oh everybody loves Russia 80% of people are voting for this is ridiculous to think that anybody in Russia is gonna answer [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=788.18s)]
*  Do you like Putin? Do you support Putin on a survey? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=795.38s)]
*  Can you imagine a Putin's a murderous dictator who kills all of his enemies and he controls through violence? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=798.3s)]
*  Nobody's answering a survey correctly this you know top song is complete propaganda [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=804.9399999999999s)]
*  Putin has control of the entire media apparatus there [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=810.54s)]
*  What this showed actually if you step back and you look at go to the party though if you were invited well [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=813.86s)]
*  I mean are there gonna be potential LPs there [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=818.94s)]
*  last week [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=822.1s)]
*  It's just a joke folks, but stepping back if you look at modern-day dictators, they tend to stay in power for about three decades [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=824.62s)]
*  Putin's in his third and [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=831.7s)]
*  I think we're gonna see in the next ten years [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=833.98s)]
*  Putin lose power and he's going to be out of power [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=838.74s)]
*  And when we look back on it, it's gonna be one of two causes [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=843.38s)]
*  It's gonna be either cancer which you know, the speculation is his head cancer and that's why he disappears from view [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=846.3000000000001s)]
*  Because he might be getting treatment [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=852.62s)]
*  And we'll look back on us that the end of his power will be his control of [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=854.82s)]
*  Russia which he [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=861.98s)]
*  controlling these [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=863.7800000000001s)]
*  Controlling through violence and fear of violence and threat of violence is exhausting [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=865.26s)]
*  You have to be paranoid and that's why it generally doesn't last that long [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=869.2199999999999s)]
*  Especially compared to the West where we have a democracy and people last about a half decade [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=872.18s)]
*  He will look back on his end which will be in the next ten years either [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=877.14s)]
*  Through cancer or through his invasion of Ukraine. This is the biggest blunder he's ever made and and this is [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=882.02s)]
*  Crazy sign that somebody would actually [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=889.14s)]
*  Attempt or even float a coup is insane [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=892.62s)]
*  He's murdered every single person who has ever even [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=896.26s)]
*  You know challenge his authority in a minor way the fact that his one of his right-hand men [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=899.9s)]
*  This is one of his tight inner circle [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=905.5s)]
*  The fact that one of the people in his tight inner circle would actually [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=908.5s)]
*  Start heading towards Moscow is insane [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=913.26s)]
*  So to say this wasn't a big deal and Putin's, you know now consolidated power and everybody's in the street dancing [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=916.34s)]
*  six [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=923.14s)]
*  This is just simply not true. I never said it wasn't a big deal. I wasn't talking about you [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=924.42s)]
*  I was talking about the mids on Twitter. I never mentioned your name. I think that [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=928.9799999999999s)]
*  Your point Jake out at the beginning [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=932.54s)]
*  That this doesn't really seem to change anyone's point of view on the outlook your point of view [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=935.54s)]
*  Sounds like it's the same as it was a week ago [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=939.86s)]
*  Saks your point of view is probably the same as it was a week ago [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=942.3399999999999s)]
*  I think there are a couple of takeaways here for first of all [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=945.4599999999999s)]
*  They've had polling of opinion in Russia for a long time and like I said when the polls go the way that [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=948.62s)]
*  The Western sources want no one questions their accuracy again [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=954.86s)]
*  I don't know exactly the methodology but Levada Center is an independent pollster that Western publications do trust [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=959.32s)]
*  I hear them repeat it over and over again and you know by their methodology, which I assume hasn't changed [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=965.62s)]
*  I think Putin's popularity before the war is around 65 percent now. They're showing it at about 83 percent [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=972.34s)]
*  Jason you may not like the war and you know, I certainly don't like the more like I know nobody likes the war [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=977.78s)]
*  But I think it is simply a fact that the Russian people have rallied around the flag and they do support [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=983.66s)]
*  This war and and Putin as the leader [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=990.38s)]
*  Now I do think he has egg on his face here from this per Goshen uprising in terms of did I see this coming? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=993.4399999999999s)]
*  No, I didn't have this on my bingo card. I don't think anybody else did either [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=999.54s)]
*  However, did I know who per Goshen is? Certainly. I mean, I've been tracking per Goshen statements [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1002.38s)]
*  Since around February. He's been vocally criticizing the Ministry of Defense [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1007.38s)]
*  specifically Shoigu and Jurassic Moth in increasingly insubordinate and you could argue even seditious ways [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1012.06s)]
*  I'm really kind of surprised in a way that he wasn't dealt with before this and I'm sure that the Kremlin is kicking itself [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1017.9399999999999s)]
*  We're probably not dealing with it sooner. But in terms of why he's still alive [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1024.8s)]
*  I think that Putin had a really tough decision to make about you quash this [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1029.62s)]
*  Rebellion completely which would have led to horrific images of you know violence potentially in Moscow or [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1034.98s)]
*  Russians killing Russians that might have actually led the the Russian front to question itself or collapse [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1043.5800000000002s)]
*  So I think he did the expedient thing which is he cut a deal [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1049.88s)]
*  He got Lucas Schenck to help broker it and he cut a deal and I think at the end of the day [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1052.98s)]
*  I think that he made the cool-headed decision that was in his and in Russian interest [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1057.14s)]
*  Which was to avoid this to getting to the point of a bloody violent insurrection [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1064.1s)]
*  I get to mop any any point of view shift for you coming out of [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1068.48s)]
*  The prego shin event of the last week on Russia Ukraine. I mean, I want to know how much he got paid [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1073.1399999999999s)]
*  To stop marching towards Moscow. Yeah, I mean it is like a man must have been it must have been a lot [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1080.34s)]
*  Not bad for a guy that was what put it Putin's caterer a few years ago, right? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1088.62s)]
*  Started a catering business guys. I spent nine years in jail. This guy's like been nine years in jail [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1093.12s)]
*  It's like the sopranos he went to jail for nine years for selling illegal hot dogs or something [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1097.76s)]
*  Just paid billions of dollars to basically stop this paramilitary group from taking over one of the largest countries in the world [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1104.32s)]
*  It's a large nuclear arsenal in the world. Yeah [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1110.82s)]
*  It's just so you know who this guy is [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1113.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean, he really is the street thug that Putin is always accused of being he was a street thug [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1115.68s)]
*  He did go to jail [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1122.7s)]
*  He was one of these guys who came up in Russia as a businessman when to be a businessman [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1124.22s)]
*  You had to be so tough businessmen were getting murdered left and right by gangsters [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1130.3000000000002s)]
*  You almost have to be a gangster yourself [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1134.3000000000002s)]
*  Apparently he made some money in the supermarket chain business and that led him to create a catering business [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1136.5800000000002s)]
*  Which brought him to Putin's attention and he started catering for the Kremlin. He's sometimes called Putin chef [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1142.5s)]
*  I don't think he was a chef himself [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1148.3400000000001s)]
*  He was a guy who owned he owned the business and then from there he was given the license to create this PMC this private [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1149.98s)]
*  military corporation [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1157.34s)]
*  Wagner group he wasn't the only founder of it [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1159.54s)]
*  He had a co-founder was actually the military man behind it [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1161.8600000000001s)]
*  But Wagner became this this group of mercenaries who do all sorts of business in [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1165.3s)]
*  Africa mainly where they are working on behalf of governments there [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1171.5s)]
*  To protect mineral resources or oil wells [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1176.22s)]
*  A sopranos captain who would he be like Phil leotardo does like 20 years in jail comes out [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1180.02s)]
*  I think it's sort of like John Gotti going against Michael Corleone [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1184.78s)]
*  Yeah, I think that Putin is sort of the very cold right rational guy with everything in his head. Who's very calculated [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1188.06s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't reveal much right more like a Michael Corleone. Whereas I think that he's emotional [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1195.54s)]
*  Emotional erratic he's been saying these statements for months here [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1201.66s)]
*  Which I don't see how they lose cannon loose cannon and the crazy thing though is is that what you saw on Twitter and social media? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1205.02s)]
*  Was unrestrained glee really delirium over the idea that per Goshen might topple Putin and become [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1212.14s)]
*  The custodian of Russia's thousands of nuclear weapons [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1219.42s)]
*  Yeah, you know so my comment on this whole thing is be careful what you wish for why in the world would Americans [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1222.64s)]
*  Want that we'd be jumping out of the frying pan into the fire [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1230.06s)]
*  You know [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1232.94s)]
*  I've been saying since the beginning of the war that this fantasy that Putin's gonna be toppled by a palace coup and you're gonna replace [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1233.44s)]
*  Him with Navalny or something like that or we're gonna get Gorbachev 2.0 [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1238.86s)]
*  I said that was always unrealistic and what you're much more likely to end up with is an even worse [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1242.34s)]
*  Dictator or possible or a hardliner and I think that is what would happen if for Goshen had taken over [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1248.1399999999999s)]
*  I think would have much worse for the West [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1253.78s)]
*  The final point is what's the takeaway from here is I think this is gonna put more pressure on Putin [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1255.3s)]
*  To conduct the war in a more violent way [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1260.94s)]
*  I know that people already think that the war is horrible and violent but Putin has been criticized by hardliners on his right [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1263.7s)]
*  for basically making the war a special military operation instead of an all-out war and [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1272.1s)]
*  Progosian I think expected to find more support [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1276.94s)]
*  Among the sort of ultra-nationalists in Russia and among the military [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1280.1s)]
*  Who have been critical of Putin for waging the war in what they consider to be? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1283.74s)]
*  To half-hearted or an incomplete way. They would like to see this declared to be a war they would like to see the full [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1288.58s)]
*  Mobilization of Russian society and this is the problem that I see now is that I think Putin already knew but this has to [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1295.22s)]
*  Underscore for him that this war is existential for him personally if he loses at the end of not only his regime [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1302.42s)]
*  But probably his life in Russia and I think he's gonna do whatever it takes to win this war [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1308.14s)]
*  and I think you could see now over the next few months a [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1313.38s)]
*  Full mobilization in Russia and I think that this could lead us to the next point of escalation in this war [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1315.6200000000001s)]
*  That is if this Ukrainian counter-offensive actually successful on some level right now it is it is not succeeding [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1321.14s)]
*  So there's no reason there's no reason for Putin to do that [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1327.0400000000002s)]
*  But if this counter-offensive succeeds you will see the next level of escalation. So sacks you did a great job stringing six points together [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1329.46s)]
*  I think Mikey takeaway is which is now 18 points you've made so you can retire for the rest of the show [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1336.06s)]
*  Mikey take away from your series of statements. However, is an important one, which is to watch the potential escalation driven by Putin here [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1342.82s)]
*  Any wrap-up? Otherwise, I'm gonna move forward with [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1351.7s)]
*  You know thinking about this like [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1354.6599999999999s)]
*  There's a famous Sun Tzu quote the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1357.5s)]
*  This is a big [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1363.34s)]
*  Mistake and we need to make sure that we don't get into an a war with Taiwan and China and China over Taiwan [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1365.54s)]
*  So okay, we have to avoid these things and then that's what I are in alignment Sun Tzu Calacanis. We heard it here first [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1371.5s)]
*  Let's move forward with peace. I can only hope that the conflict ends soon as I've always said I [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1378.26s)]
*  Realized over the last week how little I know about the Russian military conflict with Ukraine and I appreciate [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1384.48s)]
*  Saxes contributions super helpful. I went to Cal UC Berkeley [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1392.08s)]
*  1997 fall of 97 and it was the last year [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1398.72s)]
*  That Cal had affirmative action admissions and I remember at that time [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1402.6799999999998s)]
*  there was a big case a guy named Baki was rejected by the University of California Davis Medical School and he alleged reverse discrimination in [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1407.6s)]
*  1974 and sued the University of California and [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1415.56s)]
*  Eventually it became a landmark US Supreme Court case Regents of the University of California verse Baki and in [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1419.48s)]
*  1995 the UC Regents voted to eliminate affirmative action [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1425.8s)]
*  So the year that I was at Cal I think was the last year of affirmative action [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1429.84s)]
*  Admissions and it's obviously been a pretty hot topic [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1435.32s)]
*  Here in California [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1439.96s)]
*  For the past, you know 25 30 years this morning [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1443.12s)]
*  The Supreme Court ruled on two separate cases regarding using race as [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1447.08s)]
*  an admissions criteria in college admissions and [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1453.0s)]
*  The votes were six to three against affirmative action in the University of North Carolina case and six to two against affirmative action in the Harvard case [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1456.1999999999998s)]
*  Katanji Brown Jackson recused herself because she previously served on Harvard's board of [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1464.72s)]
*  Overseers all the conservative as they're you know kind of [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1469.52s)]
*  Characterized judges voted to strike down affirmative action and all the as they're characterized liberal judges [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1472.52s)]
*  voted to keep it both of these cases were filed in 2014 by a group called students for fair admissions and [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1477.8799999999999s)]
*  Effectively the court said that at Harvard at UNC the schools were systematically [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1484.36s)]
*  discriminating against Asian Americans in violation of civil rights laws [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1490.68s)]
*  By using their race as a system for for profiling [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1494.1599999999999s)]
*  Excluding and trying to be more inclusive of a more diverse and racially diverse [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1499.04s)]
*  Set of applicants so to mouth I'd love your read I guess on the surprise or [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1504.2s)]
*  This was an except expected case. I think Saxon. I mentioned this before but I think we both expected this to happen. I [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1510.96s)]
*  Think it's probably important to maybe [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1518.8799999999999s)]
*  Set up a more practical explainer [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1522.84s)]
*  Freeberg so Nick if you want to just throw up that [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1526.1200000000001s)]
*  Image that I just sent you we can sort of explain the genesis of [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1529.92s)]
*  the lawsuit so what you can see here is [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1534.8s)]
*  admit rates into Harvard by race [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1539.56s)]
*  Ethnicity, but also by academic decile [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1544.44s)]
*  Yeah [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1547.2s)]
*  and so what it basically shows in a nutshell is an African American student in the 40th percentile of the [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1547.68s)]
*  Academic index is actually more likely to get in than an Asian student at the hundred percent up [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1554.84s)]
*  And so that at the core is sort of always being that means that means that the Asian American student [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1561.3s)]
*  had better scores than 99 percent of [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1568.24s)]
*  other applicants [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1572.32s)]
*  And still didn't get it, right, right [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1573.8s)]
*  So you have to go back I think to [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1578.12s)]
*  2003 [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1581.72s)]
*  When essentially what the Supreme Court said is like look we're gonna allow this affirmative action stuff to last roughly for another [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1583.08s)]
*  25 years [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1590.76s)]
*  But by that point we expect that the work that needed to be done will have been done again [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1592.08s)]
*  this is them saying this not me and [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1597.48s)]
*  So I think what today does is actually [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1600.96s)]
*  Quite important not just for what it means for universities [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1604.8s)]
*  But also what it means for private enterprises so just to take a second on this I think what happens today is [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1609.54s)]
*  The pretty obvious stuff which is that you have to change [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1616.62s)]
*  University applications you have to change all of the admissions profiling all of the stuff that you would normally do [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1620.62s)]
*  You probably I'm not even sure if you can even have a box where you can declare race. Maybe you can or cannot I don't even know [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1627.86s)]
*  But all of that changes today [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1634.46s)]
*  So then the question is well, what's the first-order derivative what change is next and I called someone who's a pretty well-known [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1636.5s)]
*  Constitutional Supreme Court lawyer on this and [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1645.02s)]
*  The next step is [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1648.3400000000001s)]
*  Probably going to be around athletics based and legacy based admissions [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1650.7s)]
*  So athletics based admissions are pretty obvious, which is you don't really have great grades [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1655.6200000000001s)]
*  But you're really stupendous at a sport that's important to that school [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1661.3s)]
*  So then they let you in because they want to compete in said sport for whatever reason [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1666.54s)]
*  the legacy one is even more prickly which is not you're kind of a dummy but your parents are rich and or went to the [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1671.26s)]
*  school before and so then they let you in as well and [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1677.46s)]
*  His thought on this is that those things [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1683.7s)]
*  Will go away [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1687.06s)]
*  Because if you can't use race-based admissions to kind of balance the scales [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1688.8600000000001s)]
*  Then it'll become pretty quick where somebody launches a legacy based lawsuit or an athletic based bias lawsuit and wins that as well [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1694.62s)]
*  So that's the first-order derivative. So, you know the thought are those because those aren't constitutionally [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1703.74s)]
*  Protected whereas [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1711.2199999999998s)]
*  equality [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1713.26s)]
*  Based on race, but it becomes a huge headache for these schools [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1714.1799999999998s)]
*  Right. And so you're going to be fighting these [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1717.82s)]
*  Admission standards constantly changing and so if you're not gonna let you know a [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1720.76s)]
*  bunch of poor minority black and brown kids in but you're [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1726.0s)]
*  Letting in the sons and daughters of rich important people. I think that that's going to paint that school in a very bad light [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1730.52s)]
*  White typically white typically like although one would say the great thing over the last [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1740.0s)]
*  Couple of decades is there have been a lot of minorities that have gotten into these very elite schools [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1745.68s)]
*  Which means this their kids would be the first generation that's eligible for legacy, but you're gonna wipe that away [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1750.68s)]
*  So I think from a just a social stigma perspective and I have a solution for this which I'll get to at the end for those [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1757.34s)]
*  People but so I think that's the first-order derivative [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1763.84s)]
*  The second-order derivative is now what lawsuits get launched and what are the implications for private companies, right? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1766.04s)]
*  So right now this affects any institution that receives federal funding and that includes all the universities [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1771.96s)]
*  So there's no private or public university really except for a handful that don't take this money. So they'll all have to do this [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1778.1200000000001s)]
*  but the really important question after that will be what happens to companies like Apple or Facebook or Exxon who have [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1784.0s)]
*  race based programs to try to [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1792.32s)]
*  attract [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1795.1200000000001s)]
*  African American engineers or [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1796.44s)]
*  Hispanic [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1799.48s)]
*  Chemists whatever the program is that you want to come up with [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1801.24s)]
*  will those get challenged and will those companies have to change and [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1805.1200000000001s)]
*  my friends thoughts on that were that yes that those would also change and [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1809.26s)]
*  That's gonna have a really important impact on private enterprise and how they approach this stuff and how [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1813.5600000000002s)]
*  Dei stuff works and frankly downstream how ESG works because all these ESG checkboxes now some of them will actually become [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1819.0800000000002s)]
*  illegal, right [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1826.48s)]
*  So I think the importance of decision can't be really understated [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1827.92s)]
*  It's going to the changes will be slow and then they'll be fast [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1832.3600000000001s)]
*  they'll first touch higher ed, but then I think they'll touch private enterprise and so I think it was a [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1837.04s)]
*  There's a very important [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1841.8000000000002s)]
*  decision in America that just happened to mark what is [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1844.3600000000001s)]
*  What is the right ethics and values? I mean, what do you guys I guess we could just do this around the table [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1848.72s)]
*  Jay Cal maybe you kick it off [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1854.24s)]
*  Should we I mean from your point of view do you think that [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1856.8s)]
*  values should include [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1861.0s)]
*  racial diversity in [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1863.28s)]
*  admissions and universities [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1865.36s)]
*  Yeah [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1866.76s)]
*  This is like the ultimate or is the values about equality of opportunity for everyone regardless of race, right? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1867.28s)]
*  You're asking the exact right question. I think [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1873.56s)]
*  The world's greatest moderator but yeah doing a solid job so far and this creates a lot of cognitive dissonance for people, right? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1876.92s)]
*  because you you really want to [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1882.64s)]
*  Believe that the world is a meritocracy and you know if you were to take other [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1886.24s)]
*  Pursuits in the world. You'd never say like we should let race gender [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1891.8s)]
*  age affect [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1896.28s)]
*  People's performance in the hundred-yard dash or their their compensation at a company, right? All of that should be based on achievement [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1898.4s)]
*  and so there is a question on what [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1905.64s)]
*  achievements should be taken into account when you apply to a school and [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1908.96s)]
*  It's pretty obvious the legacy thing, you know is [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1913.04s)]
*  You know a back door into these schools [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1916.84s)]
*  But we want to feel like we're also making progress because listen the world has been unfair [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1919.3799999999999s)]
*  the world was built on slavery and [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1925.9199999999998s)]
*  our country has you know, it's only 150 years past that and [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1929.52s)]
*  Civil Rights Act was what 1964 or 65 like we've we've we really want to see everybody achieve here [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1934.1999999999998s)]
*  So I think you have to pause for a second and say well if the goal is you want to see [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1940.24s)]
*  You know black Americans perform better and I think that's the the underlying [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1945.28s)]
*  Concern here and it is based on the legacy of America [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1952.04s)]
*  Well, how do you do that? And I think we're looking way too far down in the educational pipeline [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1956.3600000000001s)]
*  The solution here is really childcare. The solution here is nursery schools pre-k [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1963.2s)]
*  Elementary school education and those things need competition and that's where people fall behind [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1968.04s)]
*  To be looking at this at the end of the academic journey is I think crazy. So [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1972.44s)]
*  You know when I'm president, I'm gonna have 365 day a year, you know childcare and [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1977.84s)]
*  Pre-k and that's where we should if we really want to try to make up for some wrongs in the history of this country [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1985.28s)]
*  And try to have better outcomes. We need competition in schools [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1990.84s)]
*  Which means probably breaking some of these unions and giving people vouchers and choice and then we have to invest more in the earliest [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=1995.1200000000001s)]
*  stages of education and [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2001.76s)]
*  I think [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2003.8s)]
*  everybody wants to see a better system here DEI to Chumat's point is [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2005.16s)]
*  It is illegal to hire people based on race gender any of those criteria [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2010.8400000000001s)]
*  Obviously and the DEI programs are trying to fill more applicants [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2015.68s)]
*  So their goal typically in the way they don't break the law is to just try to in their best [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2021.08s)]
*  Cases find more applicants. And but even that does feel [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2027.8s)]
*  like there's many times in life when [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2033.28s)]
*  People will say things in corporate America like we have too many white guys in this these positions [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2036.72s)]
*  We need we cannot hire another white guy [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2041.8s)]
*  So the reality of DEI that I've seen up close and personal when I was at AOL I've told the story before [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2044.08s)]
*  Somebody said to me there's no way for us to make you an EVP [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2049.6s)]
*  You have to stay at SVP and I said why is that like I'm doing all this EVP level work [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2053.2s)]
*  and they said cuz you're a white guy and [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2057.24s)]
*  The entire company is white guys at EVP and we cannot add another white guy there [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2059.52s)]
*  But we'll just give you the same bonus compensation. So don't worry about it. And [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2064.7999999999997s)]
*  So there's all kinds of games being played here, but I think it's great that we're having this conversation, right? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2068.3199999999997s)]
*  It's a hard conversation for America to have for me the [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2072.24s)]
*  I've talked about this in the past. I've always had [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2076.16s)]
*  Concern [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2080.2799999999997s)]
*  When we make the shift away from equality of opportunity to equality of outcome [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2081.48s)]
*  Because we all have this objective that we want to see [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2087.56s)]
*  Everyone have equal rights to success in some way in the United States. The question is at what point do you move beyond? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2090.92s)]
*  opportunity where everyone is given an equal opportunity in this country to [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2099.3599999999997s)]
*  Invest themselves in transforming their own lives [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2105.6s)]
*  versus a [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2109.12s)]
*  equality of outcome where regardless of how much you do how much effort or [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2110.92s)]
*  Your trials you are given the same as everyone else and that ends up looking a lot like socialism [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2116.8799999999997s)]
*  And it's very concerning because I think it limits progress and opportunity for everyone [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2122.16s)]
*  the real challenge with this particular topic is college admissions about [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2126.0s)]
*  Outcome or is it about opportunity its outcome in the sense that you spend 12 years [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2132.48s)]
*  Going to elementary school and high school and working hard to get yourself into college [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2137.64s)]
*  So it's the outcome of all of that effort and some people aren't given the opportunity to have success during those 12 years and [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2142.7599999999998s)]
*  you know and [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2150.9199999999996s)]
*  It is an outcome [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2152.52s)]
*  What do you think we should do and it's an opportunity? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2153.68s)]
*  Because it's about going to college because without having a great college cycle [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2155.9599999999996s)]
*  You may have a more tougher time getting into a into the workforce [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2158.92s)]
*  So that is why it's a hard value question for me. I I don't have a great answer on this [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2161.7200000000003s)]
*  But I'm just pointing out it's a lot like the abortion argument where both sides have some [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2166.84s)]
*  Value oriented point of view that feels like it's negating the other person's point of view [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2174.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, they're both coming from either [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2179.36s)]
*  This is an opportunity or it's an outcome decision and that's what makes it so challenging the National Bureau of Economic Research [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2181.8s)]
*  Did a study in [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2187.2799999999997s)]
*  2019 that they published and what they found was that [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2189.32s)]
*  43% so for three forty three percent of white students admitted to Harvard were [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2194.08s)]
*  athletes or [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2199.7599999999998s)]
*  legacy students or children of faculty and staff [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2201.84s)]
*  Or had a relative that were donors to the school [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2206.0s)]
*  Forty three percent wait it's rigged and then they found on top of that that's 75% of those white students admitted from those four [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2210.56s)]
*  Categories would have been rejected if they had been treated as a normal applicant [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2218.92s)]
*  So I think for all the people that are looking at all the black and brown kids that may not get into a place like Harvard [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2223.64s)]
*  If you don't look at these other categories [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2230.6s)]
*  It is a little it's a bit of a gross injustice quite honestly [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2233.8399999999997s)]
*  That these institutions have to evolve and if you're gonna be forced to be meritocratic then actually be meritocratic [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2236.98s)]
*  And by the way, I actually am fine [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2243.62s)]
*  With legacies and donors, but I think what should happen is you should just publish a rate card and you should make it hyper [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2246.58s)]
*  Transparent and so I love it for the rich guy who's got an idiot son or daughter [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2252.7000000000003s)]
*  Let's just be upfront and honest with everybody. It costs 50 million dollars to get into Stanford [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2257.42s)]
*  It costs 80 million dollars to get into Harvard [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2262.38s)]
*  We all know these numbers so we should just publish them [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2264.9s)]
*  You should pay the price and be done with it and for Harvard and Stanford and Yale and all these schools [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2267.48s)]
*  Having an extra 10 or 20 dummies, but an extra 2 or 3 billion may be a reasonable trade-off [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2273.58s)]
*  But at least it would be transparent and fair, right? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2277.9s)]
*  This is an important free market question as well because these are private institutions. They're privately funded not if they take federal dollars [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2280.86s)]
*  They're not agreed. Yes, but if they take federal dollars, they're not and then it becomes a government [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2287.92s)]
*  Processing its government influence. It's a state school all those is there a separate category here [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2292.38s)]
*  Just like country clubs or any private membership club where the members of the club get to decide who they want to admit to the club [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2297.58s)]
*  And is that un-American and should the Supreme Court and should our Constitution have a role in defining how private institutions? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2304.92s)]
*  Make decisions about who gets it. No Harvard could absolutely return all the federal funding the billions of dollars a year they get that's totally reasonable [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2313.02s)]
*  Then they decide to just focus on legacy admits [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2319.52s)]
*  That's totally reasonable. It's within their rights [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2322.92s)]
*  Sax like we got a guy. I know that I know that you used up your quote your speaking quota already [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2325.78s)]
*  Well, yeah, I didn't want to I don't want to but I'm gonna give him for my points [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2330.4s)]
*  I want to hear just one last second for Jake health minutes. Go ahead. I give you okay [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2334.7200000000003s)]
*  So yeah to two points, I guess so on the legacy thing. I agree with Jamal that we should get rid of it [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2338.6600000000003s)]
*  It's not meritocratic. I think that if they did publish a rate card, that would be more honest [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2344.08s)]
*  But they'd be too embarrassed and ashamed to do that. But I think making that argument exposes the hypocrisy of it [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2348.8s)]
*  I've already told my kids I'm not helping them get into college [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2355.1800000000003s)]
*  So they're gonna have to do it on their own. And so look I think that's the best thing by the way [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2357.78s)]
*  That's the best if you can give kids. Yeah that perspective. Sorry, go ahead sex [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2362.1000000000004s)]
*  I don't mean so that's that's point number one fully agreed on the legacy thing with respect to the decision itself [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2366.26s)]
*  Can I just clarify that do you believe that the legacy thing should be like in federal law? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2372.0600000000004s)]
*  I mean, is that a government thing or do you think that that's how those institutions should behave because those are different [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2377.8s)]
*  I mean, I'm asking are you suggesting that the law should be involved that the government should be involved [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2383.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't know if it's a legal thing because I don't know how to implement that law [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2387.2400000000002s)]
*  But I think it's somebody they should stop doing one way or another [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2389.96s)]
*  Maybe it should be a law, but I think it should stop. So I think that's point like I see things for private [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2392.6800000000003s)]
*  Private membership. So just let me just double click on that [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2397.6800000000003s)]
*  Do you think that should extend to private membership clubs like country clubs as well that they shouldn't be allowed to? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2401.1600000000003s)]
*  Decide who they let in and don't let in what makes it different that it's Harvard [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2405.8599999999997s)]
*  Is it because it's education versus any other private no because it takes federal funding [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2409.66s)]
*  It takes taxpayer money. I should not pay for some person to be able to get into a school [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2414.06s)]
*  They don't deserve to get into just because their parent went there or just because their parent wrote a check. That's [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2420.4599999999996s)]
*  Unreasonable and if they don't take federal funding these schools take so much federal funding that their quasi public institutions [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2427.08s)]
*  Even the private ones, so that's the distinction. That's the distinction for you just to be clear. And also there is a strong [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2433.2400000000002s)]
*  Meritocracy opportunity argument on this and I think it's why that whole parents college admissions scandal was [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2440.36s)]
*  Was such a big deal is that for a lot of people in this country the ability to have your kids advance themselves [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2447.92s)]
*  By being the first to get into college or go into college or going to a better college [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2455.08s)]
*  That is a big part of creating opportunity in this country so for people to try and defraud that I think created a huge backlash [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2459.14s)]
*  So look, I think that the legacy thing just needs to end one way or another. I don't know exactly what the right legal [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2466.7s)]
*  Implementation is I have two questions for the panel number one. Should you be able to say by geography? [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2475.44s)]
*  Hey, listen, we're Harvard or we're Stanford. We want to have a representation of people from around the world [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2480.98s)]
*  So we're gonna you know have the top three students from each country or you know, or by population [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2485.92s)]
*  However, you do it, you know mathematically [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2491.96s)]
*  Come in so a little bit of geography because I did hear from one of these [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2495.2400000000002s)]
*  Coaches that cost like six figures to get your kids into college. They said the best thing you can do is like move to Kentucky [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2499.2400000000002s)]
*  You know and then [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2506.32s)]
*  Harvard and Stanford are looking to get a certain number of students from each state [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2508.84s)]
*  I don't know how true that is, but they said that's like one of the top ways to do it [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2512.34s)]
*  And then well, do you remember Jason just to build on your point? I don't know if you guys remember but a few years ago [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2515.54s)]
*  The the in fashion thing to do was to learn to play squash and I remember all these parents telling me that and [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2520.02s)]
*  They had kids that were older than my kids and they were they were hiring full-time squash coaches [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2526.98s)]
*  Because apparently squash was like yes angles angle shots. Yeah, I think like stop with the angle shooting guys [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2532.98s)]
*  Yes, the gun should go off you should run the race and your time is your time and you should go to whatever the best school [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2539.7999999999997s)]
*  Is that you deserve to get into based on your academic ability now going back? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2546.9199999999996s)]
*  The big problem and I think Jason you really nailed it on the head [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2551.24s)]
*  Trying to fix it with affirmative action at the university [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2555.8799999999997s)]
*  Is still quite unfair in the sense that there are so many black and brown kids [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2559.68s)]
*  I think with tons of potential that don't even get there [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2563.8399999999997s)]
*  And so the real question is what are you doing at the grade school and at the high school and at the preschool? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2566.74s)]
*  so that you actually get more of these kids to the starting line because [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2573.1s)]
*  Fixing it when they're 18. I think is a little too late. Yeah, right fixing it [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2577.2999999999997s)]
*  Three four and five years old. That's when they deserve and need all the help in the world two years [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2582.98s)]
*  That's why we need school choice. We need charter schools [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2588.5s)]
*  We need to break the monopoly that the unions have over the schools running it running it for their own benefit and not fight [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2590.9399999999996s)]
*  enemy if you define institutional racism as [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2596.76s)]
*  Conditions that trap people in conditions of poverty across generations [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2600.2400000000002s)]
*  I'd say the abysmal quality of our public schools [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2604.08s)]
*  Are as number one and one two and three and the reason is because there's no competition and the unions running for their own benefit [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2607.08s)]
*  They're under they shut down these schools for in California because they didn't want to work is they're afraid of don't know don't see the sea [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2613.08s)]
*  Where we just got a label? [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2619.26s)]
*  Beep it up. We're gonna be [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2621.12s)]
*  That was not for the benefit of kids and it wasn't medically necessary that was a benefit they saw for themselves [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2624.06s)]
*  Yeah, Jake how you come you come from a family. Yep that were [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2629.2599999999998s)]
*  Members of unions because they worked for fire for police. Yeah, is that right? Yeah [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2633.54s)]
*  We speak negatively about the effects of the teachers unions on our public education system. I think it's absolutely correct [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2639.8599999999997s)]
*  But how do you share the point of view from the other side if you're a teacher and you're a member of the union and the union takes care of you [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2647.2799999999997s)]
*  What's the argument sure to say this union is damaging public education and the teacher that's working in the union and a member of the union says this is necessary for my [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2654.2799999999997s)]
*  Lively or to protect me for my benefit [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2664.2799999999997s)]
*  Help us share the point of view because we all have the strongly held point of view that the unions are destroying and eroding public education [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2667.2799999999997s)]
*  People have the right to form unions [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2674.7400000000002s)]
*  But what we all do is we are forced to be consumers of one educational product because of how we pay taxes [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2678.7400000000002s)]
*  We pay taxes in I think in my in California [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2684.7400000000002s)]
*  We each pay sixteen thousand dollars into the educational system [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2687.7400000000002s)]
*  And so if you're a parent, you should get that 16k back and be able to choose what you do with it [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2690.7400000000002s)]
*  So there's competition so the unions can have protection, but there still should be competition for these services [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2695.7400000000002s)]
*  And I think there are two separate issues. Yeah, there's one other thing which is I just want to give a shout out to a nonprofit that I support called smash Academy smash.org [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2702.2s)]
*  It's done by Mitch and Freda Kapoor that Mitch Kapoor founded Lotus one two three if you're under the age of 40, you might not know him [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2713.2s)]
*  And what they do is they realize that a lot of the students who do get into good colleges are not going to be able to get into good colleges [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2722.2s)]
*  It turns out a lot of the black and brown students they get accepted and they're behind in math [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2731.66s)]
*  And so what smash has done is they have a three year program and I go speak at it sometimes and I donate money to it [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2736.66s)]
*  And I encourage you to do the same. They have this intensive summer program. So before you go to college, Shemoff, if you were one of those students [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2742.66s)]
*  You know, you might get into college and then they drop out or even worse [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2749.66s)]
*  They switch from a stem to liberal degree to a non stem degree because they're two years behind on stem or a year behind on stem [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2754.12s)]
*  And so the Kapoor has found this like little opportunity to kind of catch people up and I think that's what we have to do [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2763.12s)]
*  We have to address this much earlier and not put a bandaid on it. Yeah, and the system the Ivy League system, you know needs to [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2769.12s)]
*  Well, it's not just I have these right? I want to just pick on Harvard, but it's like all the state institutions [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2778.58s)]
*  Which we talk about institutions, okay all institutions that receive federal funding [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2783.58s)]
*  They need to take a deep look in the mirror and say are we doing the best thing for society? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2788.08s)]
*  The second question I had for the panel was well, I'm not getting you [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2791.58s)]
*  But yeah, but our pure academics the best way to accept people into a college or should there be some blend of it? [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2795.7799999999997s)]
*  Like putting sports aside because that's an obvious one, but you know is there's academics, but then there's also creativity [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2802.2799999999997s)]
*  You know if you you might be terrible on your SATs or standardized tests and you might be an incredible virtual SO pianist [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2807.88s)]
*  So I think yeah, what is the criteria and making that criteria fair is what we all want and it feels tremendously unfair [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2814.1s)]
*  my point of view is [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2821.1400000000003s)]
*  If the government is funding these schools, then the government certainly has to have a point of view on what's the reasonable? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2823.38s)]
*  Model for admissions the government's not funding the schools. I love a diversity in a marketplace [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2830.88s)]
*  I love having different schools having different admissions criteria that allow different people to find their path [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2838.02s)]
*  Through different institutions to your point. Juilliard does not care perhaps as much what you did on [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2845.62s)]
*  you know your SAT in chemistry and [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2852.86s)]
*  Art schools do not care as much how well you did in math and [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2857.42s)]
*  STEM schools don't care whether or not you want an art competition [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2861.98s)]
*  And I think that that's the important thing that we need to preserve we need to preserve [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2865.3999999999996s)]
*  optionality for institutions to define what sorts of individuals they want to try and recruit and [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2871.0s)]
*  Progress and train and get ready for the workforce and the path in life that they then choose [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2876.8799999999997s)]
*  Versus trying to create a cookie-cutter model for what the government says [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2882.68s)]
*  It's fair for everyone and as much as we can take government funding out of these institutions and out of these systems and give them [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2886.24s)]
*  Freedom to set their own admissions criteria and create differential [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2892.22s)]
*  Educational systems. I think that's gonna create the best diversity of a workforce [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2896.98s)]
*  And I'm I would kind of be more excited about that sort of [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2902.2999999999997s)]
*  An institutional system than one that is standardized by the government. You know why that'll never happen [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2906.74s)]
*  Because the profit motive of these universities is really to be shadow organizations for their endowments and [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2913.2999999999997s)]
*  The thing with endowments is that the people that work there very much want to [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2920.36s)]
*  Get paid and behave like [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2926.4s)]
*  profit generating organizations and I think [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2928.68s)]
*  The issue is that if their sole job was to really fund the [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2932.32s)]
*  Operational expenses of the university then the endowments would be run very differently, right? [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2940.64s)]
*  Like take again, I just looked up on the internet but Harvard has about the operating expenses are roughly [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2945.18s)]
*  Five and a half billion dollars a year, but the revenues are about five and a half billion dollars a year, right? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2952.44s)]
*  So if instead you had to basically fund, you know, there was essentially no revenue per se, right? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2957.24s)]
*  There's there was very little tuition and you didn't take any federal funding. You'd have to come up with five billion dollars a year [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2962.8399999999997s)]
*  So you just basically take that as a draw [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2968.72s)]
*  From your endowment the endowment would be run very differently it would be a don't lose money endowment that would generate [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2972.2999999999997s)]
*  Very low vol returns. I think the problem with that is that that's not how the endowment at Harvard works [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2980.7s)]
*  They wouldn't necessarily make [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2987.1s)]
*  Risk seeking investments in things like private equity and hedge funds and venture capital and to the extent they did they would just make much much [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2989.14s)]
*  Fewer much much smaller or both [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2995.42s)]
*  So I think what you're saying could be possible [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2997.8199999999997s)]
*  But the problem are probably the endowments at these universities, okay [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=2999.96s)]
*  Well, I three billion dollars moving Harvard's endowment now, so yeah, it would be 10% [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3003.88s)]
*  Can anyone tell me who the largest real estate owner is in San Francisco? [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3009.2000000000003s)]
*  You see working on the internet. Oh, no, I know I know it's that Institute the Academy of Art University [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3013.2400000000002s)]
*  I knew this because they kept buying things and using them. I think you know [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3018.7200000000003s)]
*  She used all the profit over the years to buy more real estate and she accumulated that money [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3023.12s)]
*  And she accumulated the largest real estate portfolio [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3028.62s)]
*  Sorry, who is she the founder I forgot her name [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3032.86s)]
*  This is a for-profit university or private or I mean a nonprofit university [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3035.62s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of artists that come out of Academy Art and they work in a lot of different industries including industrial design [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3040.1s)]
*  including animation [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3046.02s)]
*  I'm saying is it like RISD or is it like actually an art school? Oh, no, it's a great art school. Yeah Academy of Art [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3048.22s)]
*  Anyway, let's keep going. So look speaking of stem [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3055.06s)]
*  Making a big pivot away from art [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3058.56s)]
*  To AI a couple big news items, you know [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3061.98s)]
*  The AI frenzy continues here in Silicon Valley all the way from early to growth stage funding [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3065.98s)]
*  Through to M&A events. We saw this week data bricks [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3073.34s)]
*  Which is a privately held data infrastructure company announced that they were acquiring mosaic ML for 1.3 billion dollars that headline number [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3077.74s)]
*  Is based on a cash and stock purchase price where the value of the stock that was being used to acquire mosaic ML [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3085.92s)]
*  Was based off of the last round valuation for data bricks, which was 38 billion dollars from a fundraising that they did in 2021 [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3095.02s)]
*  So arguably the valuation should be lower and the overall purchase price could be considered lower [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3102.2200000000003s)]
*  But that's besides the point mosaic ML as you guys may remember as a company. I mentioned a number of episodes ago [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3106.56s)]
*  Led by the founder of Nirvana, which was an early AI business that was acquired by Intel [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3113.92s)]
*  And then he started mosaic ML and he offers [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3120.92s)]
*  Open-source models and I shared the performance data of their most recent announcement on the show a few weeks ago [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3124.8799999999997s)]
*  You know, there's rumors. I don't have any confirmed reports, but there's rumors that mosaic ML saw [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3131.7999999999997s)]
*  Their ARR grow from 1 million to 20 million dollars since January [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3138.02s)]
*  There was other rumors that said they were only at 6 million of revenue [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3142.96s)]
*  Regardless data breaks is paying a pretty hefty premium and I think it begs the question [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3146.3399999999997s)]
*  What do data infrastructure database companies end up looking like in the future if AI has to become part of the core infrastructure? [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3150.8599999999997s)]
*  Of every enterprise and this is creating a big shift. So sacks as our enterprise [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3157.98s)]
*  software [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3164.62s)]
*  Investor expert maybe you can share with us what this means for the sector. Does this buoy excitement for AI? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3166.5s)]
*  Infrastructure startups does this change the investing landscape? Is it just reinforcing what folks are already doing? I [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3173.84s)]
*  Think it's a reinforcement. I mean the space is probably the hottest space. We're talking about like AI infrastructure for enterprises [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3181.96s)]
*  I think it's probably the hottest space right now and in venture land. We actually looked at this deal [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3188.56s)]
*  We had a small location there next round. They had a term sheet for a series B [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3193.36s)]
*  Emergence was actually an elite it and this is mosaic ML. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know if I'm supposed to be telling you all this but [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3199.6400000000003s)]
*  That a term sheet from emergence to raise 50 million at 400 posts Wow [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3213.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and we were gonna have a small allocation in that and as I recall [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3219.7999999999997s)]
*  The valuation was somewhere around [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3224.6s)]
*  30 to 35 times ARR which actually is not that insane for a very fast growing company in a hot space [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3227.4s)]
*  So that implies about 10 million of ARR. I don't remember the exact figure [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3233.48s)]
*  But I think it's that sort of the ballpark but growing very very quickly [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3237.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean up from like one or two at the beginning of the year, right? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3241.12s)]
*  so I actually [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3245.64s)]
*  Understand why someone would want to acquire or invest this company? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3247.96s)]
*  Like I said, I think we wanted to invest and while we were sort of you know [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3252.04s)]
*  Trying our best you didn't say anything when I talked about him on the show a few weeks ago [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3255.8799999999997s)]
*  You were just sitting there mom's a word or actually I knew that this deal was was basically in the works because [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3259.24s)]
*  The founder called us up and he had already promised us a small allocation around [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3264.7599999999998s)]
*  Naveen did and he called up and said actually I've got this deal [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3269.6s)]
*  So we're putting the round on hold and so I didn't think I should say anything because obviously it was still ongoing [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3272.8s)]
*  But yeah, we knew about this deal that was kind of coming down the pipe [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3280.48s)]
*  I didn't know for sure that it would happen [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3283.6400000000003s)]
*  But but yeah, we heard it was in the ballpark of this like 1.2 1.3 billion dollar number [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3285.1200000000003s)]
*  Which like you said because Databricks is a private stock. Maybe it's only [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3290.8s)]
*  Half of that or 750 or something like that. Who knows? It's still a great deal [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3295.1200000000003s)]
*  but you know, a lot of you are saying it's a crazy deal, I don't think it's a crazy deal because [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3299.0800000000004s)]
*  Before this happened after Naveen signed the term sheet [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3302.8s)]
*  For the series B an investor came over the top to invest in a 700 million dollar valuation [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3306.84s)]
*  So people were kind of going crazy now. I don't think that's necessarily a rational behavior [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3313.32s)]
*  I think that's more of evidence of a mania going on [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3318.4s)]
*  But I think that what he got offered is obviously a fantastic deal [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3321.44s)]
*  And I think what its evidence of is that these big enterprise in for companies are gonna try and build an end-to-end [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3324.32s)]
*  Tool chain here and I think mosaic ml had a very very important part of the [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3332.16s)]
*  Tool set which is training up these models basically maximizing GPU [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3338.2799999999997s)]
*  Efficiency because GPUs are basically the scarce item right now [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3343.6s)]
*  We have a GPU shortage and it's probably you're not gonna get better for a year or two if that so [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3346.98s)]
*  This is a very important part of the of the stack and I think it's probably a smart acquisition for both. Yeah [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3352.52s)]
*  I mean remember snowflake which competes with data breaks also acquired Neva [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3358.92s)]
*  Which was founded by one of my colleagues a guy I work with and you really great guy [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3363.7200000000003s)]
*  sweetheart for 150 million dollars last month that deal was announced and [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3368.76s)]
*  the pattern recognition that seems to emerge here is that if you're in the [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3373.6s)]
*  Data infrastructure business it seems like it's becoming critical to level up that it's not just about storing and [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3377.6400000000003s)]
*  moving and manipulating data [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3384.88s)]
*  But the interpretation of data through models and the tooling to build those models becomes a critical component [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3386.8s)]
*  Bing of all of these tool kits that these software companies have to provide to their enterprise software companies [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3394.0800000000004s)]
*  And it's a big leveling up that's necessary [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3399.2400000000002s)]
*  Which seems to me there's other companies out there like them that are also going to need to strap on tools like this [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3401.2400000000002s)]
*  To make themselves competitive in this market scape, which means that there are more acquisitions still to come [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3408.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, come on Jake how you guys agree or have a different point of view [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3414.0800000000004s)]
*  Looking at it. It's a it's a big number the headline number, but I agree with sacks that the actual numbers half the number [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3418.36s)]
*  So if it was you know, if you look at the number of engineers they had based on linkedin data and pitch book data [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3424.2400000000002s)]
*  Probably 60 70 employees 80 employees and then 40 50 of them are engineers [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3430.32s)]
*  so that puts it at 30 million dollars per engineer and that's one way to look at these acquisitions and [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3435.0800000000004s)]
*  I think you know [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3441.4s)]
*  Probably three to ten million dollars per engineer for like really high-end engineers is more the going price [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3443.48s)]
*  But if this is half that amount because they bought it with monopoly money, in other words their 2021 price for their company [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3450.2400000000002s)]
*  It's great. And then they get nailed it free bird. What's happening is [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3457.08s)]
*  this layer of [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3461.32s)]
*  natural language on top of [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3463.6800000000003s)]
*  any service whether it's something as simple as the help or something as complicated as a giant [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3466.36s)]
*  financial company with tons of transaction data being able to talk to it and understand it and then have your [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3472.92s)]
*  Machine learning team build tools [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3480.96s)]
*  So business owners don't have to hire data scientists the actual business leaders [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3483.36s)]
*  Can talk to the data and get back answers or just say hey, tell me about our customers [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3487.36s)]
*  How have they changed over the year and then hey, that's pretty interesting. Tell me more about our customers and [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3492.92s)]
*  You know, how are they [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3498.68s)]
*  Reacting to these three new products and you will get back in intelligence that previously was unable [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3500.8s)]
*  to be [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3509.04s)]
*  Accessed and so I [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3511.16s)]
*  Was I was just at Sequoia yesterday with or two days ago with the latest seven graduates from our accelerator [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3513.16s)]
*  we bring them to meet with Sachs and his team we bring them to meet with Sequoia and [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3519.64s)]
*  when we were at Sequoia, I [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3523.32s)]
*  Realized that of the seven companies four of them would not have been possible [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3525.56s)]
*  Before these machine learning API's were available and open AI is but one there are now in the companies [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3531.04s)]
*  I'm talking to their their trialing free Berg on average [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3537.36s)]
*  678 language models before they pick one and they're not picking open AI every time [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3541.2400000000002s)]
*  Putting that aside these businesses were not possible before [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3545.76s)]
*  this technology was introduced and available via API in the last six to twelve months and [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3549.2400000000002s)]
*  I think there's a bunch of businesses that economically would not work that now work. I can give one example [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3554.32s)]
*  There are countless meetings that are recorded over zoom, right [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3562.48s)]
*  Think like a local school board meeting [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3567.84s)]
*  well [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3570.32s)]
*  Nobody could ever make a database of all the discussions going on at local school boards and then analyze all [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3570.8s)]
*  But now because all of those are saved on zoom and they occur on zoom and they're available for public record [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3577.28s)]
*  You can ingest every single one of those and then build a Bloomberg terminal of every discussion happening at every school board [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3583.92s)]
*  everywhere in the United States and do that with [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3590.7200000000003s)]
*  Chat GPT or any of the language models and then get really great insights from it [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3594.08s)]
*  That would be too costly to transcribe at you know, a hundred dollars every hour to and normalize let alone to analyze [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3598.96s)]
*  and so I'm looking at [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3606.36s)]
*  Businesses as an investor what I'm looking at right now is businesses that were previously not economically viable [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3610.0s)]
*  before this technology and then that are now economically viable if that makes sense and [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3616.68s)]
*  I'm just looking at each company under that [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3622.64s)]
*  Lens right now and I'm finding a lot of interesting startups. They seem to have that in common to mock similar news supporting this very quick [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3625.28s)]
*  evolution further up the value stack [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3632.72s)]
*  So we were just talking about these companies that are providing effectively tooling as infrastructure [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3635.24s)]
*  a little bit more up the value stack is inflection AI, which was started by Mustafa Suleiman and [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3641.96s)]
*  Reid Hoffman who was a co-founder while Mustafa was working with him as a [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3648.72s)]
*  venture partner at Greylock [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3655.24s)]
*  but Mustafa as you guys know was the [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3656.72s)]
*  Co-founder of deep mind which Google bought for four hundred million dollars really created the core of Google's AI [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3659.48s)]
*  Capability and is considered one of the kind of preeminent thought leaders and entrepreneurs built that has built in this space [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3664.94s)]
*  He started inflection and [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3671.6400000000003s)]
*  The business just announced today that they've just closed a 1.3 billion dollar funding round led by Microsoft Reid Hoffman [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3674.28s)]
*  Bill Gates Eric Schmidt Nvidia [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3680.6000000000004s)]
*  with an intention of [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3683.36s)]
*  building the largest AI cluster in the world [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3686.0s)]
*  22,000 Nvidia H 100s as part of the build out but I think you've shared [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3688.84s)]
*  Historically that these big funding rounds for these AI businesses that haven't necessarily even launched product yet [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3694.84s)]
*  Don't make sense. Is this still you know, kind of reinforce your point and you know, what's your read on on the inflection funding? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3700.76s)]
*  Well, the list price of an H 100 is about 30 odd thousand but the street price [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3708.32s)]
*  It's very hard to get it so if you go to the if you go to like eBay and try to buy an H 100 [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3714.38s)]
*  It's like 40 or 45 thousand [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3718.5s)]
*  so if you have a [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3721.06s)]
*  22,000 cluster of H 100s, that's about [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3722.94s)]
*  900 million dollars of capex just that and then you know all the sundry stuff around it [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3726.1400000000003s)]
*  Call it roughly plus or minus a billion dollars [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3733.34s)]
*  And so of the one and a half billion they've raised let's say a billion goes into building this [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3737.1800000000003s)]
*  22,000 node cluster [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3742.2999999999997s)]
*  You have 500 million for SG&A [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3744.18s)]
*  And so what that leaves behind is basically two and a half billion of enterprise value for their chatbot [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3746.3399999999997s)]
*  So, I don't know. I mean I've never used PI has anybody any of you guys used it [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3753.74s)]
*  Do you guys know if it's good Jason? I'm sure you've experimented with it. Have you experimented with it or not really which one? [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3757.8599999999997s)]
*  PI [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3763.8199999999997s)]
*  That's what their that's what their chatbot is called PI. Yeah, I think it's like hey pie commerson [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3765.54s)]
*  I think I did try it once and [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3771.0s)]
*  it was [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3774.1200000000003s)]
*  Not memorable. Oh, you mean po no, not no [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3775.8s)]
*  That's core. I just like your personal one where you talk to it and I say hey [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3780.4s)]
*  How are you doing and their concept is like you have this one relationship? So it's like one chat thread [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3784.52s)]
*  It's not kind of how I like to work with the I use threads and I share threads with my team [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3789.88s)]
*  So I'm not a fan of this like you have one relationship with one assistant [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3795.34s)]
*  I think the thing is it's interesting to note that [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3798.52s)]
*  Very rarely when you invest money in the billions of dollars [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3801.6s)]
*  Does the capex or purchase of one specific form of equipment take up literally? [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3806.4s)]
*  25% of the enterprise value that's a typical [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3813.96s)]
*  at least for a startup [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3817.92s)]
*  Here if you're buying a fixed plant of a slow cash for generating business [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3820.24s)]
*  Maybe you know a bunch of that has some value so that's what stood out to me in all of these things Reberg is again [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3824.0s)]
*  Increasingly, this is all just a pass through to Nvidia [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3830.16s)]
*  It's probably in some ways a pass through to the big cloud providers [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3835.28s)]
*  So whenever I see a chip maker and a cloud provider come together to put in a lot of money [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3838.7200000000003s)]
*  It's essentially round-tripping cash [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3843.02s)]
*  They're giving them money which then they use to buy their services and then you know, you just you're just pumping revenue [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3844.94s)]
*  So I hope it works [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3850.04s)]
*  I wish them the best, but that's the... [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3852.04s)]
*  We just talked about where the infrastructure companies that are increasingly looking like [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3854.68s)]
*  more commodity service providers if they don't up level with AI tooling, acquiring Mosaic ML [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3861.4s)]
*  and acquiring Neva, do you think that that's an indication of more M&A to come? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3869.32s)]
*  And if so, doesn't that justify the increased funding, the increased valuation and the activity [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3876.7599999999998s)]
*  that we're seeing in the early stage with some of these businesses? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3883.08s)]
*  I think for sure there's going to be more M&A and I think the valuations will be high, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3885.32s)]
*  not because these companies have a lot of revenue yet, but because it's very strategic for these big [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3889.16s)]
*  infra companies to assemble the end-to-end tool chain. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3893.56s)]
*  I think we should explain to folks what that means. Enterprise software companies provide [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3897.56s)]
*  software to businesses that are not traditionally technology companies. They also provide software [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3902.2s)]
*  to other businesses to help them build new tools, to help them build out their business. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3906.68s)]
*  So an enterprise software company can sell to United Airlines or consult a Visa or consult a [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3911.56s)]
*  Ford and that software can then be used by that company to build tools that are powered by [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3915.64s)]
*  the database or powered by the data analytics or increasingly powered by AI tools. And so they [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3921.96s)]
*  can build AI applications and AI capabilities into their business, whether it's United Airlines [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3928.04s)]
*  or Expedia or Visa or whomever. And that's why these companies are so critical in terms of enabling [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3933.16s)]
*  the transformation of industries with AI tooling and why getting AI tooling into their capability [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3940.52s)]
*  set is so critical right now. It's important to note though, guys, that whenever you have the [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3946.52s)]
*  emergence of a new sector, Sachs, I think you are right that M&A goes up, but it tends to be that [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3950.2s)]
*  the valuations go down. Peak M&A froth happens at the beginning of the cycle when hype is at maximum [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3956.36s)]
*  and facts are at the minimum. And that's okay. That's good for the startup. It's marginally [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3963.2400000000002s)]
*  negative for the existing shareholder of a large company. And then over time, it gets itself sorted [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3970.84s)]
*  out when the facts are more obvious. So it's kind of like, you guys remember when the optical [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3976.04s)]
*  networking craze hit and you had these multi-billion dollar acquisitions and where did they go? They [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3981.48s)]
*  went nowhere. They just disappeared. We actually have like a market map that we did that I think [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3987.56s)]
*  can explain this concept of an end-to-end tool chain. So this is a slide that our growth team, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3992.36s)]
*  shout out to Mike Robinson and Kim McEbara, they put this together in preparation and part of the [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=3999.4s)]
*  investment memo for Mosaic. And I think to explain the point you were kind of making, Freeberg, like [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4004.44s)]
*  why do enterprises need these services? One really simple way of thinking about it right now is that [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4011.08s)]
*  every enterprise would like to roll out its own chat GPT. They would all like to have their own [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4017.08s)]
*  internal version of chat GPT where their employees, for example, could ask questions and get answers. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4022.2s)]
*  That's where all the action is right now. Every enterprise would buy that tomorrow if it existed [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4028.2s)]
*  in the way that they want. Give an example of what that is, Sax. Yeah, give an example. The idea would be that [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4033.72s)]
*  any employee in the company could ask questions to the AI model the way you can ask chat GPT [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4038.68s)]
*  questions and it would have all the enterprise's data and it would also understand their permissions [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4043.24s)]
*  and have all the security settings so that only the right field could get the right information. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4047.3999999999996s)]
*  That's the kind of intelligence they want to unlock. I mean, there are lots of other use cases as well, [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4051.8799999999997s)]
*  but that's a really simple one. A corporate oracle. So I can, if I'm in HR, I can ask, hey, [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4056.2799999999997s)]
*  tell me about our compensation. Yeah, totally. Co-pilot for the CEO. I think there's going to be [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4061.16s)]
*  lots of these. I think the sales team is going to have their own co-pilot. I think the marketing [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4066.52s)]
*  team is going to have their own co-pilot and customer support has it already. Customer support [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4069.48s)]
*  will have it. And engineers will have their own co-pilot. So there's going to be a lot of these, [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4073.96s)]
*  but I think enterprises want one at the level of the call it the company intranet where employees [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4077.72s)]
*  could just ask it questions. But they do not want to share their data with open AI. That's very clear. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4083.0s)]
*  They want to roll out their own models. So the question is, well, how do you roll out your own [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4088.84s)]
*  model? And what this shows here is the different piece of the stack that you have to have. So first [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4092.68s)]
*  you capture all of your data. You got to label it to be classified right for the model. You got to [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4096.68s)]
*  store it somewhere. Then you need to get one of these open source AI models off the shelf. And [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4101.48s)]
*  there's probably the most prominent site for this called a hugging face, which already has something [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4106.76s)]
*  like, I think a $2 billion valuation. That's another like really crazy valuation to ARR [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4111.8s)]
*  multiple, but hugging face has kind of all the open source models. It's very active. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4118.2s)]
*  And so people grab the latest open source model. That's the best fit for them. And then they need [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4123.16s)]
*  to train that model. And that's really where Mosaic played. And there's a ton of activity right now [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4128.12s)]
*  in this last mile problem of how do you customize a model to make it suitable for your use, whether [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4133.16s)]
*  you're an enterprise, whether you're a customer service team, whether you're a SaaS app that [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4138.599999999999s)]
*  wants to incorporate AI capabilities into your app. That's where all the action is right now is [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4144.04s)]
*  customizing these open source models. That then leads to basically be able to get the right [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4149.4s)]
*  inferences. And there's a sort of separate category around hardware that is, you know, [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4154.2s)]
*  we don't play there, but this is kind of the end to end tool chain. I think these big tech companies [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4159.32s)]
*  are going to be racing to put this whole thing together. Fill it out. Yeah. Yeah. And that's, [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4163.56s)]
*  so there'll be more M&A is your prediction, which means more startup valuation, boom, [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4167.72s)]
*  a more capital deploying. There was a couple of articles this week and Chamath, this is your red [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4171.64s)]
*  meat as much as Ukraine is, Sax is, because you've talked about this at length. Social messaging [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4178.360000000001s)]
*  startup IRL is shutting down after a board investigation found 95% of its claimed 20 million [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4185.0s)]
*  users were actually fake. This is a company that in June of 2021 raised $170 million Series C at [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4190.76s)]
*  a valuation of over a billion dollars, making it one of the many proclaimed unicorns of Silicon [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4197.08s)]
*  Valley led by SoftBank's Vision Fund. The investor who was sitting on the board said that they didn't [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4201.5599999999995s)]
*  know if we've ever given an investment term sheet to a startup faster than SoftBank gave to IRL [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4206.2s)]
*  at the time. At the same time, different story, but in the same week, a company called Baiju, [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4212.44s)]
*  which Chamath you have talked about in the past was once valued at $22 billion and claimed to be [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4217.96s)]
*  India's most valuable startup is in turmoil as shareholders and creditors are seeking to dilute [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4223.56s)]
*  the founder and he's rushing to find capital and raise a billion dollars to try and buoy the [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4228.04s)]
*  company process. One of the investors marked the company's valuation down to 5.1 billion, so down [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4234.120000000001s)]
*  75%. I guess the question is overall, are we still seeing this kind of turmoil in Silicon Valley from [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4239.160000000001s)]
*  the Zerg era funding of startups in stark juxtaposition to the excitement and the [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4247.64s)]
*  frenzy around AI? It's a characteristic of the exact same thing, meaning if you replaced AI [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4252.68s)]
*  with crypto, it's the exact same thing. If you replaced AI with co-working, if you replaced AI [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4259.160000000001s)]
*  with, I don't know, synthetic biology, if you replaced AI with SaaS, this has all happened [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4269.16s)]
*  before. I think it's important to identify what this is. What this is, is that there aren't enough [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4277.32s)]
*  checks and balances and there are fundamentally people who are deeply inexperienced, who are in [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4283.96s)]
*  the wrong job. And in the few key moments where the venture capitalist is supposed to add value, [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4290.36s)]
*  that person is ill-equipped and unprepared. Why? Because they were the VP of X, Y, and Z at some [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4299.16s)]
*  startup and they got hired through no fault of their own into a dynamic because these venture [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4304.04s)]
*  funds wanted to raise larger and larger amounts of money. So what happens? You don't even know how to [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4310.679999999999s)]
*  ask the basic questions or even more insidiously, you don't have the courage to say [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4317.08s)]
*  the hard thing. And so these things happen that are frankly inexcusable. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4323.24s)]
*  Right? So in the case of one of these companies, and I've mentioned this before, [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4330.84s)]
*  they approached us for financing and when we asked for a data room, we got a Google doc link [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4335.64s)]
*  to a spreadsheet. Now there's no reasonable world in which a company is that unsophisticated when [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4342.68s)]
*  it comes to understanding their business. Right? A data room should include an enormous amount of [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4349.08s)]
*  operational and financial metrics that you can use to come to your own conclusion, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4355.72s)]
*  so that you can present it transparently to the investor. The idea that boards wouldn't even hold [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4359.56s)]
*  these companies accountable is just a sign that the board members themselves are pretty fundamentally [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4366.84s)]
*  inexperienced people. And I think the thing that we do, which is a mistake, is we say, oh well, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4371.72s)]
*  X, Y, and Z firm led this deal. Yeah, that may be true, but really what it means is that firm [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4377.0s)]
*  in a grab to get the money, hired some person that checked some boxes, put them in the job, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4385.56s)]
*  that person led around, and there just wasn't any infrastructure to either teach that person or then [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4392.2s)]
*  that person to have the courage to hold the founder responsible. That will play out in AI [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4399.24s)]
*  as well. It's just that we're at the beginning of the hype cycle, right? Because we replace AI again, [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4403.8s)]
*  as I said, with any of these other things, we sat here a little bit hand wringing when we saw these [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4409.639999999999s)]
*  crazy valuations for these NFT projects. Where are those now? Right? So you name it. This is about [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4414.5199999999995s)]
*  fundamentally inexperienced people doing a job that seems pretty easy from the outside, [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4421.4s)]
*  but in practical reality, there are only a few legends in our business. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4427.400000000001s)]
*  Most people, and I think it was Shai Goldman that did the math on this, most people [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4431.320000000001s)]
*  do not know how to run these businesses well. Nick will find that tweet you can show. I think it's [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4435.320000000001s)]
*  like two and a half percent of all of the funds that are in pitch books, so over 800 of them, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4441.320000000001s)]
*  have ever generated more than 3X in two funds. So this is a hard business, it turns out. You can't [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4446.68s)]
*  just wake up and be an investor, it turns out, and that's what we're finding. So I don't know, [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4452.84s)]
*  it's not very surprising in the end. None of this is surprising. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4458.2s)]
*  Chamath had a really good point in the middle there is that there is a generation of venture [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4461.64s)]
*  capitalists who were added during the boom, who were operators, but they've never been taught to [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4465.400000000001s)]
*  have the discipline of capital allocators. And one of those key pieces of discipline [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4469.64s)]
*  is asking uncomfortable questions and doing uncomfortable diligence. And you can trust people, [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4474.76s)]
*  but you need to verify that is a key part of the job. You can trust the founders, but you have to [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4482.36s)]
*  verify that the data you have is correct. The fact that SoftBank did this, that incredible valuation, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4487.88s)]
*  and the person who did this deal, never checked that the customers were real, is makes you unfit [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4493.16s)]
*  to serve in the job. And I will do diligence. And during that time period, Freiburg, I had many [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4502.36s)]
*  founders say to me, you're asking for more diligence than the lead. And this deal is closing, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4508.76s)]
*  and we are oversubscribed. And I said, Okay. And they said, Okay, so you're not going to ask, [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4514.360000000001s)]
*  you're not going to require this business. Oh, no, we require this diligence, we want to see [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4519.4800000000005s)]
*  your, you know, very basic stuff, your bank statement, your PNL, we want to talk to once [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4523.0s)]
*  you give us a list of your first 1000, give us a list of 500 customers from last month, we'll give [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4527.64s)]
*  you five numbers, we're going to talk to five random customers, like people did not want to do [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4532.68s)]
*  this stuff, we do that this work at our firm, when we start to own 510% of this, and we train [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4536.2s)]
*  our founders to do to be ready for proper diligence, all that diligence is happening now. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4540.76s)]
*  Now, in the early stages, there's not much to go on. But you can check stuff. During this period, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4545.08s)]
*  people founders used the hot market to not participate in the due diligence process. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4550.599999999999s)]
*  And when you look at companies, a lot of times people will suspend suspend disbelief, [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4557.96s)]
*  you know, this company by Joe, I don't know a ton about it, but it seems to have, you know, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4562.76s)]
*  like an educational app, like a company brilliant.org that Chamath and I are in that [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4567.72s)]
*  early investors in and Chamath incubated. Great, great business. And but then their business and [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4572.52s)]
*  their revenue seems to be based on a series of like Kuman like, in person instruction, that's [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4578.76s)]
*  not a high gross margin business. Sorry, if you have to have a storefront, you're not a software [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4584.6s)]
*  business anymore. And so people started giving valuations. And this is the second part, and I'll [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4589.56s)]
*  just wrap on this people started giving valuations to these companies that were real world businesses [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4594.200000000001s)]
*  that were low margin businesses, direct to consumer, whatever it was, they suspended disbelief, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4598.280000000001s)]
*  and they gave them valuations for high growth, high gross margin businesses. And that was another [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4603.080000000001s)]
*  mistake. And you put those two things together, not doing diligence, and then just misvaluing [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4610.200000000001s)]
*  of actual assets. That's the cleanup work that's been that's going on right now. And it takes years, [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4615.96s)]
*  I mean, it took decades for them to pinch Bernie Madoff, it can take 10 years for these frauds to [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4621.32s)]
*  come out. There was a guy who kept telling the SEC about Bernie Madoff, I think he was like nine [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4627.32s)]
*  years since the first time he let them know that the you know, perfect returns were just not possible [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4631.4s)]
*  statistically. So it takes time, but they're they're picking these folks up everywhere, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4637.88s)]
*  Doe Kwan got picked up in Montenegro, you know, the guy from Luna. And it's going to take a decade [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4644.2s)]
*  to clean up all of the fraud in our space. I think this was sort of mentioned by Jamal, but I think [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4649.32s)]
*  it needs to be a bigger point, which is the influence of fund size on these decisions. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4654.44s)]
*  I mean, craft funds are in the six to 700 million range. So when we write a check, it's usually 10, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4659.88s)]
*  15, $20 million check in a series A company. That's like a big check for us, we're really [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4666.2s)]
*  going to sweat that decision for Softbank at 10 to $20 million check in $100 billion fund, [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4672.68s)]
*  which is what they had. It doesn't even make sense. It's a waste of their time. It's not even a [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4678.6s)]
*  rounding error for them to basically make a decision $1000 check for you. Yeah, exactly. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4683.0s)]
*  So for them, they had to write $200 million checks to justify their time managing $100 billion. And [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4689.0s)]
*  so the mistake when they make a mistake is 20 times bigger than it should be. That should have [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4696.200000000001s)]
*  been maybe a $10 million mistake, not a $200 million mistake, but their fund size forced them [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4700.68s)]
*  to basically write these gigantic checks. And they're writing them into companies that were [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4706.6s)]
*  effectively seed stage or series A companies. If it was into a growth stage company, I think that's [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4711.0s)]
*  fine. There's a lot more data and there's a lot more customer references that you can check at a [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4716.280000000001s)]
*  later stage company. By the way, the number one part of diligence I'd say for us other than [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4720.76s)]
*  at metrics, which is anyone can do is the off sheet references, talking to customers from a list [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4725.639999999999s)]
*  that you figured out yourself, not from the company itself is probably the single most important [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4732.599999999999s)]
*  qualitative part of diligence. So I don't know what happened here, but [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4737.96s)]
*  it's not stated explicitly, but I think it's important. David, you have credibility. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4742.28s)]
*  So when you say something, Sachs, people listen because you have bona fides that are undeniable. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4746.92s)]
*  Same thing with J Cal, same thing with you, Freeberg. I think, you know, and this may sound [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4751.56s)]
*  mean, but it's like most of these people are just XYZ mid level VPs from a startup. And that's a [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4755.0s)]
*  great thing, but it's not necessarily going to give you the gravitas, especially if that's not [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4761.56s)]
*  what you are forced to do to help build that company. And when push comes to shove inside of [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4768.04s)]
*  a boardroom or in the middle of diligence, there has to be conflict. I think it's a necessary [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4773.96s)]
*  feature of good decisions. And that conflict arises internally within your investment team, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4779.96s)]
*  but it also has to come externally with the executives of the startup and with the CEO [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4784.12s)]
*  themselves. Because when you're prosecuting a good decision, it's unbelievable that you agree on 100% [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4789.08s)]
*  of things. And there has to be certain things that are controversial. Otherwise, by definition, [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4793.64s)]
*  that company isn't really even pushing the boundary. So I just think that these are all skills that are [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4797.400000000001s)]
*  poorly taught while you are building a business. It is not the reason why you should have been in [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4804.12s)]
*  charge of allocating 50 and $100 million checks into companies that is just crazy town. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4809.08s)]
*  I love your point, Sachs, though, about fun size dynamics, fun size dynamics, our destiny, right, [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4814.2s)]
*  it really is. And the optimal fun size for venture is somewhere between 250 and 600 million, [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4819.959999999999s)]
*  according to everybody who's been doing this for more than a decade or two and who's successful. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4827.24s)]
*  Whether the costs are coming down. So as the input costs come down, whether it's for engineers and [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4832.28s)]
*  co pilots and, and hardware and abstraction layers, then theoretically, greater outcomes [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4836.36s)]
*  should be generated with fewer dollars in which would again, tell you that fun sizes should [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4842.04s)]
*  actually go down, not up that the reason they go up is because you get paid an annual management fee. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4847.08s)]
*  And so obviously, the way to wait, so you're not going to have to pay a lot of money to get [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4851.88s)]
*  a fixed number every year versus 2% on a smaller number. Or, you know, for example, what we did was [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4856.2s)]
*  we were like, we're going to go and hit grand slams. And so I traded off management fee in return [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4862.6s)]
*  for 30% carry. And that turned out to be literally a multi billion dollar smart decision because I [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4868.44s)]
*  gave up 10s of millions of dollars up front for back end. Now the back end could have gone to zero [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4875.4s)]
*  and maybe it still can. So who knows. But the way to make more money is to get 2% on a larger fixed [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4880.5199999999995s)]
*  number. So who knows, but you know, most folks wouldn't do that. Most folks take the sort of [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4885.16s)]
*  risk adjusted bet and say, you know what, I'll just take the 2% and I'll raise a 200 million, [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4890.76s)]
*  then a 500 million, then a billion, then a $2 billion. Yeah, and they stack them all and [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4895.48s)]
*  they get the 2% and all of a sudden the profits don't matter, which means the outcomes don't [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4900.92s)]
*  matter, which means the diligence is perfunctory and it becomes a theatrical expose that you can [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4904.36s)]
*  do. And so you can't just, you know, this sort of thin fig leaf, you can point to LPs [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4910.92s)]
*  and say, we did our work here, give us more money for this next fund. That's the rat race [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4917.32s)]
*  that the venture community is in. And it's going to get played out in companies like IRL and [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4921.8s)]
*  ByJu's and a lot of these AI companies, quite honestly. Well, and the chickens have come home [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4926.36s)]
*  to roost for all the crypto investments. This time is not different, is I think what I'm trying to say. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4930.6s)]
*  This time is not different. Did you guys see there was some article that reported that fundraising [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4934.36s)]
*  cratered? So Insight was trying to raise a $10 billion fund and they've only been able to raise [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4939.56s)]
*  two. No, no, no, it was, it was 22 down to 10 and of which they've raised two. Okay, so 10%. And then [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4944.6s)]
*  Tiger was trying to raise 12, they cut it to six and then they can only raise two. Makes sense. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4951.88s)]
*  Yeah. So basically that's like a whatever, 80 to 90% reduction in the size of these funds. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4957.8s)]
*  Yeah. Meanwhile, the sovereigns where they were going for this money are buying sports teams. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4964.6s)]
*  They're like, you know what, instead of tech, let's just buy sports teams. They're buying [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4968.6s)]
*  Series A. And they're buying Manchester United and they're buying distress portfolios. Yeah. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4972.360000000001s)]
*  And the sovereigns. But there's a huge crunch. There's a huge, we've talked about it before, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4977.160000000001s)]
*  but there's a huge crunch in late stage financing. It's only going to get worse over the next [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4980.280000000001s)]
*  18 months. I asked Brad last week, like how many of these zombie corns do you think there are? [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4984.120000000001s)]
*  He said 1,400. He said 30 to 40%. I think he might be, you know, could be look out of 1,400. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4989.320000000001s)]
*  I think it could be 700 or zombie. I think it's at least 700. I think it's, [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4995.8s)]
*  I think it's probably 60%. Yeah. And then the other 40%, let's say how many of them have a [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=4999.400000000001s)]
*  down round coming. I think 60% go to zero of the remaining 40%, half of them probably return money. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5005.4800000000005s)]
*  And then of the remaining half, half of those maybe get one and a half X. And then you get [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5015.0s)]
*  a geometric distribution from there, which means the blended return of that entire stream of [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5020.76s)]
*  unicorns will be about 1.1 X, but it will be very massively distributed. I think that is exactly [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5025.08s)]
*  right. I would, I would, everybody's getting their money back, except if you don't have diversification. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5030.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. It's the, I think the market is sending a very clear message, which is these, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5035.96s)]
*  which are you saying everybody's getting, no, no, most people won't get their money. Most people [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5041.8s)]
*  won't get their money back, but on average it's going to be one extra turn. Yeah. So it's not [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5045.08s)]
*  going to be evenly distributed. Correct. Well, I'm glad that the term zombie corn has held guys. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5048.76s)]
*  We are coming up on our time. Do you guys want to do science corner or do you want to wrap? [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5054.36s)]
*  Yeah. The three of us need to use the bathroom break. So go ahead and just, [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5059.32s)]
*  if you could just go do it, we're going to go and take a leak and we'll come back and make a [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5064.12s)]
*  Uranus joke. You know, I'm okay. I'm going to wrap. So look, it's been great. It's been great [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5067.5599999999995s)]
*  being your host. We crushed it. So give us a science corner. Give us a quick. You don't hug me. You don't [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5073.4s)]
*  embrace me. You don't love my contributions. Freeberg, Freeberg, I actually, I posted a clip of RFK [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5077.88s)]
*  talking about vaccines. I'd love for you to listen to it and actually give us the critique. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5083.96s)]
*  Yes, I will. Can we do it next week? That's going viral right now. He did such a good job explaining [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5088.52s)]
*  his position on that. He did such a good job. Yeah. Look, did you guys read the Offit piece? [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5093.4s)]
*  I forwarded it to you and I said, please read this. If you guys read that piece, I'll watch [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5098.44s)]
*  his clip and let's talk about it next week. Is that cool? So yeah, he is a vaccine scientist who [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5103.64s)]
*  RFK Jr. references often as someone that he met with and spoke with and says, I caught him in a lie [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5110.12s)]
*  and Offit basically said, here's exactly what happened. Here's the conversation. Here's the [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5115.88s)]
*  data. Here's the fact. Here's the science. And I would really, really, really encourage you guys [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5120.04s)]
*  to read that, please. And then I'll watch his clip and like, let's have a real kind of analytical [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5125.08s)]
*  conversation about statements that are good questions to ask and good things to interrogate [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5130.5199999999995s)]
*  and things that are being said that maybe aren't factually correct. And I think that we need to [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5136.44s)]
*  kind of really as a service to ourselves and to people that listen to us really do that work. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5140.919999999999s)]
*  So let's do that and come back and talk about it next week if that's cool. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5146.12s)]
*  But I encourage everyone to read Offit. He put it on Substack. Nick, we'll put the link in the notes [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5149.719999999999s)]
*  here. Let's continue. Let's continue. Exactly. I think that's the most important. You want to [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5154.599999999999s)]
*  talk about that certain Senator that all of a sudden just basically gave us the Heisman? [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5159.32s)]
*  No, we've had a lot of those, by the way. So let me just be clear. That's not the only Heisman [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5163.8s)]
*  we've received on the All In Summit. I will say that the speaker list for the All In Summit [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5167.64s)]
*  is looking fantastic. We're going to have a great time. And I'm really excited for the conversation. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5172.6s)]
*  You're saying some folks Heisman does because of our support of RFK? [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5180.84s)]
*  That did happen. And specifically the fact that that's really open minded. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5186.52s)]
*  And then there were other folks who were insulted by things said about them by people on the show. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5192.12s)]
*  Do you guys want to hear about the Nanograv release that came out yesterday? I'll cover this one real [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5197.96s)]
*  quick. What about this slow Hummer that we're all getting? What is that? That's it. It's a slow [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5203.16s)]
*  Hummer. Exactly. Are you talking about the new H3 EV but it only goes up to 50 miles per hour? [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5207.719999999999s)]
*  What is that? The new Hummer, the new HV. They have an EV? They're coming out with an EV of that. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5215.08s)]
*  Oh, you're kidding. It's hilarious. It's like a great troll. I remember when Schwarzenegger got [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5220.84s)]
*  the Hummer back in the 90s and everyone was like, oh my god, he's amazing. He's anti-invading. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5225.4800000000005s)]
*  And then the Hummer was the cool car to drive. You've got the Mini Cooper. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5229.96s)]
*  Yeah. And then it became like us. Free bugs in his Mini Cooper. It's not a manly car. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5232.360000000001s)]
*  Okay. So yesterday a paper was published by an international scientific consortium. This group [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5237.0s)]
*  is called Nanograv. And they've been using a series of instruments to measure pulsars. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5244.360000000001s)]
*  Including a 500 meter radio telescope array, which allows them to see... What's so funny? [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5250.68s)]
*  No, I just had like three Uranus jokes in one sentence and I had to stop myself. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5258.120000000001s)]
*  All right. Get them out now. Go ahead. I'm muting. I'm muting. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5262.84s)]
*  The Nanograv data that was released is 15 years of data from pulsars. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5264.76s)]
*  And pulsars are neutron stars, which are stars that have collapsed on themselves and are basically [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5269.64s)]
*  super dense and start spinning. And then these pulsars, you know, you basically like a lighthouse. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5274.6s)]
*  You can see the light. So it looks like almost like a strobe light. And we can see thousands of [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5279.4s)]
*  these across the universe and we can observe them. And the rate at which the pulsing is coming out [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5284.2s)]
*  of these pulsars tells us a lot about what is happening in the space between Earth and those [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5289.48s)]
*  pulsars. And when you collect enough data over a long enough period of time, which is what these [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5296.12s)]
*  folks have just released as 15 years worth of this data, you can start to see really interesting [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5301.08s)]
*  patterns in the data that support the theory that space time itself is slowly vibrating, [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5307.4s)]
*  being stretched, being compressed, being pulled apart, being pushed back together [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5317.24s)]
*  because of very large gravitational events happening around the universe. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5321.799999999999s)]
*  And what that means is you guys have all seen, you know, that kind of two dimensional image of a black [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5326.44s)]
*  hole. And Nick, if you could find one online and pull it up where it looks like, hey, [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5331.48s)]
*  in the middle of a black hole, space itself collapses in and it collapses down. And what [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5334.84s)]
*  happens is space and time get significantly elongated when they're really close to gravity. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5339.08s)]
*  Gravity actually pulls space, sucks it in, sucks in time, and it becomes distorted. And so when you [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5344.68s)]
*  have large black holes around the universe spinning and running past each other, they're [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5351.4800000000005s)]
*  actually pulling and stretching space time itself. And that sends out ripples throughout the universe, [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5356.4400000000005s)]
*  ripples that are slowly undulating space and time itself. So by observing all of these pulsars [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5362.04s)]
*  around the universe and the rate at which these pulsars are pulsing and seeing slight variations, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5369.56s)]
*  we can start to measure and actually see those waves, those very slow waves of space time itself [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5375.96s)]
*  undulating and being pushed and compressed. And so it supports Einstein's general theory of [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5383.96s)]
*  relativity, which indicated that space time itself can be warped by gravity. And it provides [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5389.08s)]
*  a really interesting picture on the universe itself, that all around us, we have large masses [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5394.6s)]
*  that are many, many millions or billions of light years away that are creating waves in space and [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5401.0s)]
*  time itself that we as humans will never kind of observe, realize or feel ourselves. But as part [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5406.28s)]
*  of the fabric and the underlying nature of our universe, with space and time being slowly warped [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5412.28s)]
*  and slowly elongated, slowly compressed. And it's a really fascinating picture of the universe. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5417.8s)]
*  Over time, as scientists gather more and more of this data, it will provide insights into where [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5423.320000000001s)]
*  in the universe these massive black hole events may be occurring, and also provide insights into [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5429.16s)]
*  the early picture in the large scale structure of the universe, which helps us better understand [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5434.12s)]
*  how everything started and where we're all coming from. So it was a really fascinating data release. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5438.84s)]
*  I think it's a really kind of profound thing if you take a little time and think about it. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5443.72s)]
*  It's super exciting. It's getting a lot of press coverage today and encourage us all to pull our [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5448.2s)]
*  heads out of the Ukraine war and Silicon Valley and money and all this stuff and realize that [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5454.04s)]
*  there are things of extraordinary scale and structure that are happening around us. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5458.84s)]
*  Let me ask you two questions. Number one, why does it matter? And number two, any theories [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5461.8s)]
*  here of what we might discover if this goes 10X or 100X in terms of the information we're getting? [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5468.92s)]
*  Many years ago, it was theorized that there's what's called a cosmic microwave background [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5476.599999999999s)]
*  radiation, the CMB. And what that is, it's the leftover heat from the formation of the universe, [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5481.4s)]
*  from the universe when the Big Bang happened. And these scientists figured out how to create [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5488.36s)]
*  really sensitive radio telescopes and put them in orbit and they started to observe [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5492.52s)]
*  the background radiation. And what that showed us was the fingerprint of the universe, [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5499.56s)]
*  the original structure of the universe that created ultimately all the galaxies, super galaxies, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5503.8s)]
*  and then ultimately all the stars and then the planets and everything that came from that. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5508.84s)]
*  This could be the beginning of seeing a gravitational background of the universe, [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5513.320000000001s)]
*  where we could actually start to see perhaps the fingerprint of the space time of the whole [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5518.76s)]
*  universe, of what the actual structure of space itself and time itself looks like throughout the [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5524.92s)]
*  universe with the perturbations being driven by some very large massive supermassive black holes. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5529.56s)]
*  There was a black hole discovered this week that's 30 billion times the mass of our sun. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5534.92s)]
*  There are these massive objects out there that are actively distorting space time. And we're [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5541.0s)]
*  going to start to get a fingerprint of that with this sort of data. And over time, that just gives [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5545.8s)]
*  us a better sense of what the overall structure of the universe looks like, not just from the [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5550.28s)]
*  heat energy that we're collecting, but also the gravitational waves that we're now able to observe [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5554.6s)]
*  through the inference of this data collection. This just deepens our understanding of the [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5559.4800000000005s)]
*  universe, but there's not like... The structure of the universe. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5563.24s)]
*  Yeah, which is amazing and interesting, but... And it validates and proves the general theory [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5565.08s)]
*  of relativity, which if you think about the application of that down the road, that may lead [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5570.68s)]
*  to things like close to or as fast as light travel or things related to time travel. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5574.84s)]
*  There's a lot of things that people have theorized for decades about [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5581.24s)]
*  black holes and the warping of space time itself. I'm not saying that any of this stuff is... [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5585.8s)]
*  Did you see the three body problem trailer? [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5590.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh yeah, it looks amazing. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5593.400000000001s)]
*  It looks amazing. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5594.52s)]
*  Looks amazing. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5595.64s)]
*  Looks amazing. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5596.4400000000005s)]
*  What a great... [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5597.24s)]
*  Can't believe we have to wait so long. I hate it when they put out trailers so early. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5598.04s)]
*  How long... When is it coming out? [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5600.92s)]
*  It's like next year. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5602.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5604.12s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, I still haven't seen your movie. The guy's your movie that you wanted me to see. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5605.0s)]
*  Which movie is this? [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5610.28s)]
*  I'm gonna try. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5610.759999999999s)]
*  Oh, everything, everywhere, all at once? [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5611.24s)]
*  I got a better movie for you. I got a great poll for you. It's on pay-per-view right now. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5613.0s)]
*  A movie called... About Blackberry. It tells the story of Blackberry. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5618.2s)]
*  Oh, I heard it's good. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5621.799999999999s)]
*  It's like an independent film. It is awesome. I just reviewed it on this week in startups. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5622.36s)]

*  That's a black hole. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5651.8s)]
*  That's a black hole. Just a black hole. Okay. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5653.320000000001s)]
*  Not that from the movie. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5655.96s)]
*  I think that that's from... Might be a... [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5656.2s)]
*  What's going on with Sax's hair? Because he looks like... Did you get it cut, Sax? [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-hTgRO093Q&t=5659.56s)]
