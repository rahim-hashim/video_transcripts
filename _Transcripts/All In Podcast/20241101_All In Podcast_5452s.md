*  going to get that premium founder mode did you always want to be a party promoter when you were [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=192.4s)]
*  like in high school and in college when i was in college i had a dj setup i had like synthesizer [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=196.8s)]
*  setup which i plugged in and i did live electronic music with my dj said i'm gonna drop the beat [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  i'm gonna drop the beat here it comes a couple of my startups now are doing something interesting [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=211.52s)]
*  athena bought like a pack of tickets and they're doing like a holiday party there with their top [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=217.92000000000002s)]

*  have a startup and you want to bring your startup you can buy a pack of tickets as it were that's [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  actually a really good idea a bunch of these small startups should just co-opt our holiday party as [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=241.84s)]
*  your holiday precisely yeah just buy 10 tickets and come if we were it's gonna go blow a million [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  bucks just kind of go up i'm hopeful today we're gonna sign this dj which is everyone everyone knows [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=252.0s)]
*  the dj and it is going to be pretty sick if we can get a degenerate gambler we know him we play poker [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=258.88s)]
*  with him whatever we pay him he's gonna lose twice as much at the poker game let's just let's call [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=263.36s)]
*  it what it is sax can you host um poker at your house after the party yeah no [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=269.12s)]
*  no [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=275.36s)]
*  he built an entire poker building and he's used it like seven times [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=282.16s)]
*  he's like honey david sax is just the absolute best all right let's get to work you know what's [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=286.56s)]
*  winning as well is the us gdp here we go it grew uh slightly slower than expected but the top line [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=291.36s)]
*  numbers are healthy looks like the soft landing might be baked in we'll see on wednesday the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=297.68s)]
*  department of commerce reported that real gdp grew 2.8 percent in q3 that means it's adjusted [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=303.2s)]
*  for inflation and you know you can't look at these things in a vacuum you have to look at the other [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=309.92s)]
*  western countries and their gdp japan 0.7 australia 0.2 germany 0.2 canada 0.5 the world is not growing [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=316.08s)]
*  us is growing briskly and in terms of how to think about it two to three percent is a sort of the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=324.96s)]
*  sweet spot for mature economies above three percent positive but can also signal overheating [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=332.56s)]
*  like we experienced during zirpin in 2021 under two percent yeah stagnation uh us gdp was 30 [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=338.48s)]
*  basis points below the dow jones consensus forecast of 3.1 percent there's your chart if you missed it [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=346.24s)]
*  and um obviously inflation we talked about this last week is at 2.4 percent very close to the 2 [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=353.36s)]
*  target unemployment 4.1 percent close to historic lows 10-year treasury 4.3 percent and obviously [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=360.4s)]
*  stock market at it's all-time high again there's your s&p dow and nasdaq as we've talked about over [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=367.12s)]
*  norwegian shamath the federal debt is the issue 35 trillion in debt we have a trillion annual [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=374.64s)]
*  interest payments on that debt and freebird your pet peeve 23.5 million directly and millions more [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=380.8s)]
*  indirectly as we know federal government employees now at three million it's about [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=388.0s)]
*  one percent of the country and uh state government employees 5.5 million local governments 15 million [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=391.84s)]
*  put it all together and we got almost 25 million people working for our government [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=398.72s)]
*  what do you think the prescription here is freeburg as we uh come up on election day and we look [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=406.32s)]
*  towards next year do you believe we can cut this crazy spending what do you think is going to happen [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=412.32s)]
*  to the economy will it overheat soft landing you're running a company now so you have to think [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=417.36s)]
*  about this obviously oh well i'll separate running a company because i think that's got to be treated [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=422.88s)]
*  independently from macro you can't build your business around macro but 10-year treasuries [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=429.2s)]
*  are sitting at just around 4.3 percent i think what the market is telling us and remember that's [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=433.04s)]
*  off of a low right when the the rate cuts were happening if you'll remember in mid-september [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=437.52000000000004s)]
*  we got down to just around three and a half percent the market is telling us that with [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=443.68s)]
*  the sort of economic growth we're seeing low unemployment and you know call it modest [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=448.64s)]
*  inflation this is not the time to be cutting rates and the market is saying we are expecting [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=454.56s)]
*  higher rates for longer so i do think that that's one big kind of turnaround that's happened in the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=460.0s)]
*  last 90 days which is really a i think a big surprise to a lot of folks is just how robust [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=465.52s)]
*  things are relative to where folks thought that they were about 90 days ago urging pleading and [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=470.16s)]
*  supposedly needing a big rate cut to get the economy moving again but i think at the end of [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=476.08000000000004s)]
*  the day everyone's looking to the election as kind of the next big moment in the economy both [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=480.64000000000004s)]
*  trump and kamala have made fiscal proposals that would be deeply expensive if you assume the you [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=485.92s)]
*  know these these budgeting groups that go out and take their policy proposals and try and build a [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=495.52000000000004s)]
*  model against them that they're both going to add trillions of dollars to the debt they're going to [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=499.28s)]
*  increase deficit spending etc but the reality is that neither of them are actually going to end up [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=502.32s)]
*  theoretically being able to execute all those policies and there will likely be some degree [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=508.88s)]
*  of difference that's where we end up on spending chamoff a lot of talk about doge the department [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=513.92s)]
*  of government uh what is the last word efficiency efficiency that elon might be collaborating on [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=520.4s)]
*  what do you think the chances are he said there could be two trillion in in savings that could [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=528.72s)]
*  occur what are the chances that any meaningful cuts happen and we reverse the trend in if trump [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=533.2s)]
*  say he wins and he and he and he creates that position i think the first question that will [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=540.4s)]
*  inform how dramatic the cuts are is whether we organize ourselves around an accurate sense of [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=546.1600000000001s)]
*  where the actual economy is if you look at the print today it would actually tell you that things [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=555.04s)]
*  are pretty okay and that we are not sort of near an unsustainable turning point however and nick if [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=561.8399999999999s)]
*  you want to just throw up this chart if you back out the percentage of government consumption [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=571.28s)]
*  that is included in gdp you start to see a very different picture which is that over the last [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=579.36s)]
*  two and a half years all of the economic gains under the biden administration have largely been [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=585.76s)]
*  through government consumption what that means is that private industry has been standing on the [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=595.4399999999999s)]
*  sidelines somewhat and that actually maps to a lot of this intuition that i have had over the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=603.6s)]
*  last few months when i've said i think we're in a low-key recession because what i could never [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=611.6s)]
*  figure out is why i would look at the earnings transcripts of a bunch of companies who would [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=615.36s)]
*  constantly talk about softening demand and by the way this is across the board it wasn't just cpg [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=621.2s)]
*  companies but dropbox as an example same sort of thing they just laid off 20 of their staff and the [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=628.64s)]
*  and the memo was about weakening demand so this is a broad base softening as far as companies [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=634.4s)]
*  experience the economy but the high level number is positive which would make you think that [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=641.28s)]
*  everything is fine but when you look at that chart and you back out the percentage of the positive [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=646.0s)]
*  news that the government is responsible for what it means is the economy is flat and the economy [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=652.08s)]
*  growing which means that roughly there are a bunch of folks that are seeing contraction so [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=659.04s)]
*  i think that if you normalize on that view of the world i think the cuts that elon will affect will [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=665.1199999999999s)]
*  be meaningful and necessary if you pull up this chart nick of the federal net outlays as a [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=673.76s)]
*  percentage of gdp i mean you're basically at a you're at a flat stalling economy well if you [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=682.56s)]
*  look at this you know we we basically have had high teens during our lifetime clinton era 70s and [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=690.16s)]
*  80s and then uh it's gone up into the 20s now so that is definitely something the amount of [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=696.0s)]
*  spending we're doing sorry just again this is where you can get a little confused by data jason [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=703.52s)]
*  this is net outlays and that's different from total gross government spending which also includes [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=708.48s)]
*  qe so if you go back to the other chart why is this one going down and the other one represents [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=714.5600000000001s)]
*  85 of gdp it's because that one is a more accurate sense of what the government is doing across all [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=720.08s)]
*  of its tentacles in the united states economy it includes the money printer going burr which the net [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=726.4s)]
*  outlays chart doesn't include so just to be clear about what's happening 85 of this quarter's gdp [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=732.8s)]
*  was induced by the government if you sub if you sub it out so take 2.8 and multiply it by 0.15 [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=739.28s)]
*  that is the true growth x the united states government that exists in the united states [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=747.52s)]
*  economy today sax your thoughts here on the gdp obviously looks pretty good for biden harris [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=752.3199999999999s)]
*  to have all these stats going in their favor but there is the caveat obviously about the [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=760.4s)]
*  government spending in there yeah no i think that's right i mean i i think that for harris [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=766.16s)]
*  in this election it's probably a little too late for this gdp report to be helpful if you go back [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=772.16s)]
*  all the way to 1992 where the whole election hinged on the economy remember that was bill [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=780.3199999999999s)]
*  clinton running against george hw bush and clinton's message was the economy stupid [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=785.44s)]
*  and he came up with that carville came up with it and and clinton beat bush because we had a [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=791.12s)]
*  recession and i think 91 but by 92 it was over already and in the final week of the campaign [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=797.0400000000001s)]
*  bush tried to tout a similarly positive gdp report that showed 2.7 growth that report would [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=806.32s)]
*  later be revised up to 3.9 growth so the recession was definitely over and the economy [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=813.68s)]
*  is growing again and nonetheless bush lost because voters impressions of the economy had already [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=819.8399999999999s)]
*  formed and solidified by the final week of the campaign so i think it's probably too late here [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=826.9599999999999s)]
*  for the gdp numbers to have a big impact on the election i think the other thing is that [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=832.8s)]
*  voters impression of this economy isn't based so much on the gdp numbers it's really based on [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=840.64s)]
*  their perception of inflation over the last four years and there's no question that cost of living [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=847.04s)]
*  has increased a lot of the last four years and voters are really feeling that and that i think [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=852.56s)]
*  is is playing into their perceptions of the economy and i don't think that harris has a great answer [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=857.3599999999999s)]
*  for that so i think that the bottom line here is i don't think this report is going to have a big [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=864.08s)]
*  impact on on the election in terms of where the economy is going the the thing that i would come [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=869.5200000000001s)]
*  back to is interest rates and this is the thing that freiburg was talking about which is even [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=876.5600000000001s)]
*  though the fed has cut rates by 50 basis points the long-term rates the 10-year treasury has not [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=881.2800000000001s)]
*  gone down in fact it's gone up slightly you know it's gone up to call it 4.3 percent and so we have [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=887.92s)]
*  this real issue where as the fed is cutting short rates long rates are not going down and i think [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=894.4s)]
*  that is because of the government deficit and the government debt and the fact that there's so much [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=900.4s)]
*  debt that needs to be serviced by the market for treasuries right just the the buyers are all [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=906.64s)]
*  leaving the market for treasuries the chinese we talked about this last week have been selling down [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=913.04s)]
*  their treasury position they're just aren't buyers anymore which is and i think this could this could [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=916.8s)]
*  ultimately have a very detrimental effect on the economy you already saw that i think this hasn't [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=922.24s)]
*  been widely reported but i think it should be a major piece of news which is the prime rate hit [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=927.04s)]
*  eight percent today so now it had a seven handle on it before now is an eight handle on it well [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=933.76s)]
*  this matters a lot if you want to buy a house and get a mortgage it's much more expensive [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=940.08s)]
*  then you got to think about all the people who already have debt doesn't this look recessionary [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=947.28s)]
*  totally because a few years ago you could get a home loan at a three to four percent interest rate [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=953.04s)]
*  you know and amortize that now your debt service cost can be twice as high so you just can't buy as [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=960.4s)]
*  much house it's a very bad place if the economy's in the toilet but we can't even talk about it [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=967.12s)]
*  because there is no structural way to get an accurate read because the government just [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=972.5600000000001s)]
*  perverts the effect it has in the economy like you have yeah yeah distortion fine you you cannot [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=979.36s)]
*  have a non-profit entity representing the plurality of the economic activity of a country and expect [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=987.44s)]
*  the capital markets to function properly at some point the capital markets will basically throw [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=995.44s)]
*  their hands up in the air and puke it all out and say no and i think that you're starting to see a [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=999.84s)]
*  little bit of these fissures so i think we're going to have to clean up our balance sheet pretty [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1005.6s)]
*  aggressively here yeah and if you look at the importance of that rate that rate drives the [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1009.6800000000001s)]
*  value of bonds as the current market rate for treasuries or for the prime rate climbs [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1015.76s)]
*  the value of an existing bond that pays interest at a lower rate goes down because you have to pay [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1021.12s)]
*  a lower basis in order to get back to the new high rate that the market is telling you [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1027.44s)]
*  so there are several trillion dollars and we can pull up the the graph here nick of loans [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1032.16s)]
*  and bonds that are sitting on the balance sheets of many commercial banks in the united states [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1037.92s)]
*  that are now so significantly underwater where the value is now below the current rate [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1042.88s)]
*  where the value is now below the book that they paid for those loans or that they issued them at [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1049.36s)]
*  that those banks now have unrealized losses and i think that this number is one of the other kind [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1055.12s)]
*  of facts you see a few articles come out here and there about this but the number as the rates go up [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1060.24s)]
*  the number of unrealized losses that the dollar value then realized losses of banks balance sheets [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1065.76s)]
*  in the united states has climbed so considerably that it represents a real crisis in fact the [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1070.08s)]
*  unrealized losses on banks balance sheets today is higher than it was in 2008 it's trillions it's [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1074.72s)]
*  trillions buffett warned b of a public he's been selling out he sold off right well he warned b of [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1080.48s)]
*  a publicly although a bit obliquely last year during his annual conference and it was very clear [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1087.1200000000001s)]
*  it's like listen this is an opportunity for folks to just mark to market these securities properly [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1096.96s)]
*  and or sell them and get them off the books i don't think b of a acted quickly enough and so [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1101.76s)]
*  what did buffett do he just basically started dumping and he's almost completely out of b [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1106.8s)]
*  away b of a if not completely out altogether so there's a lot of talk a crisis of brewing [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1111.84s)]
*  there's a lot of talk in finn foot if you go into sort of like the the deep far-reaching bowels of [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1118.56s)]
*  of the of the fintech community on x that there is a huge credit crisis looming amongst some of [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1124.24s)]
*  these large charter holding banks because of this exact issue and the relation between the fed and [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1129.92s)]
*  the prime is typically three percent so the fed cuts rates and then the banks put three percent [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1137.1200000000001s)]
*  on top of it when they get people credit worthy people mortgages and credit cards so as the fed [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1144.0800000000002s)]
*  cuts this should come down but if it went up what explains that i'm curious if anybody knows well [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1149.76s)]
*  the fed sets short rates it sets the the fed funds rate which is the the rate of overnight lending [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1156.08s)]
*  between banks but it does not set the 10-year treasury for example the long-term the market [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1161.84s)]
*  that the market sets back and the market now requires a higher rate of interest in order to [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1167.9199999999998s)]
*  accept you know the risk of investing in those bonds or it's not really since it's a u.s treasury [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1173.52s)]
*  it's not really risk it's more about the time value of money and their expectations of inflation [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1180.8s)]
*  how much that money is going to be worth in the future so i think what we're seeing is that the [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1186.88s)]
*  fed can cut short-term rates but it hasn't had the impact on long-term rates that everyone was [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1191.44s)]
*  expecting i think everyone was expecting that we had this sort of burst in inflation the famous [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1196.72s)]
*  nine percent inflation rate i think people were expecting that that would work its way through the [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1202.96s)]
*  system and that we'd get long-term rates back to where they were but that's not happening and it's [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1206.96s)]
*  not happening for the reason we're saying which is there's just too much debt out there so now [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1212.4s)]
*  think about the impact on the real economy let's say that you're a home buyer and you got like a [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1215.92s)]
*  five-year interest-only arm type mortgage for your house tick tock yeah so now you know you probably [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1221.92s)]
*  got that in the three to four percent range if you have to refinance it this year at eight percent [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1230.72s)]
*  your monthly payment's going to double that has a real impact on people's [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1236.96s)]
*  wealth and on their spending power maybe they can't even support a payment like that now go over to [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1241.76s)]
*  the commercial side and it's it's very similar there's a lot of commercial real estate out there [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1248.56s)]
*  you know buildings and so on where they've got debt on it you can't get 30-year mortgages in [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1254.16s)]
*  commercial the typical commercial loan is five to seven years okay we're now coming up i think in [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1259.6s)]
*  the next few years on a lot of that that debt will need to roll it'll need to be refinanced [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1266.8s)]
*  if it gets refinanced at twice the interest cost roughly a lot of those buildings may be underwater [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1271.36s)]
*  i mean they may not be you know there may be no equity value and a lot of people know this now [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1279.12s)]
*  but they don't really have to mark those positions to market if they did their equity were zero [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1284.8799999999999s)]
*  but they're kind of all on borrowed time right now hoping that rates will go back down and what [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1289.6s)]
*  we're seeing is that the long rates are not going back down it's a pretty scary proposition and then [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1296.56s)]
*  of course you know a lot of the the debt on those buildings it's all owned by the commercial banks [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1300.8799999999999s)]
*  that you're talking about the regional banks so they're sending out a lot of bad debt that they [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1305.1999999999998s)]
*  haven't had to mark to market and they're just kind of hoping that this problem will get sorted out [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1310.0s)]
*  before you know before there's a default and by the way as these numbers climb the cost to borrow [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1315.52s)]

*  got to issue more debt to pay for your interest on your current debt it's quite paradoxical that [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1342.4s)]

*  arithmetically not able to get out of your debt spiral and the markets are telling us that if the [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1372.24s)]
*  u.s doesn't take drastic action and reducing its spending and reducing the deficit levels so that [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1377.76s)]
*  we can actually address the payment obligations on the outstanding debt that we've already issued [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1382.96s)]

*  there's no other better place to put money today and there's not a lot of other you know great [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1395.6s)]

*  alternative that emerges in the next couple years and maybe everyone's kind of putting their assets [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1413.52s)]

*  to find another place to buy we'll see all right well scary but what it what it implies if if rates [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1422.32s)]
*  have roughly doubled let's say in the last few years and they're going to stay at that level [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1428.32s)]
*  they're not going back down it implies there's going to be a big d leveraging right because [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1433.52s)]
*  you know you can't support those interest payments i mean let's say that you own a building right and [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1439.52s)]
*  now all of a sudden well facts that's it's actually d leveraging or inflation because the alternative [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1444.1599999999999s)]
*  is the fed monetizes the debt they start buying all the bonds which means you're pumping more u.s [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1450.8s)]
*  dollars into the market and that means that the cost of everything goes through the roof so you [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1454.8799999999999s)]
*  have this effect of economic inflation which is the way that you inflate away the debt problem [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1458.96s)]
*  assuming people still want to use your currency yeah well i mean that's at the government level [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1463.9199999999998s)]
*  i mean i was talking about the the private sector i mean just think about it at the level of like an [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1467.6s)]
*  individual building got a loan on it now you need to refinance the loan interest rates are twice as [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1472.08s)]
*  high that let's say that that doesn't the building no longer produces operating income at that level [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1477.12s)]
*  of debt so you have to pay down some of your debt it's called an equity in refinancing where you're [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1482.3999999999999s)]
*  not pulling money out you're putting money in you have to d leverage in order to make your sort of [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1488.3999999999999s)]
*  income statement work right it's just too much debt at that new level of interest rates so if [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1492.6399999999999s)]
*  rates stay high there's no choice but for many people to d lever whether it's on the commercial [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1498.32s)]
*  side or the or on the consumer side you just can't afford as much debt right at that higher [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1504.24s)]
*  interest rate so think about the impact that has on the economy when everyone has to d lever [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1510.8s)]
*  that's a very negative effect and then of course you like you're saying at the government level [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1516.64s)]
*  you have to figure out what to do about that because our interest payments on the debt are [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1521.76s)]
*  already what 20 to 25 percent of federal revenue yeah it's about trillion five trillion yeah [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1526.08s)]
*  35 so you already see it there where there's less money to spend on current programs because [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1531.52s)]
*  you're paying for interest on the debt so what do you do about that so i i think that the next [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1537.68s)]
*  president's gonna face a pretty wicked set of problems and trade officer even though the gdp [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1543.28s)]
*  numbers are fine they're good i still think there's like a wicked set of problems related to [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1548.4s)]
*  government debt and interest rates yeah and there's no way to really skin this cat without some [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1554.0s)]
*  some i think they're yeah they're there i think the only path is you have to cut spending which [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1559.2s)]
*  is recessionary government spending which is recessionary so you're going to trigger an [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1565.1200000000001s)]
*  economic recession you're going to have to have some amount of inflation and you're going to have [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1569.04s)]
*  to have a spike in unemployment and if you don't do the first two things you're going to have a lot [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1573.1200000000001s)]
*  more inflation which is really hard to get out of so well i agree i agree that we have to be a win [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1576.48s)]
*  a win-win scenario here there's no there's no yeah i agree we have to cut government spending [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1582.0s)]
*  i don't i personally don't think it's recessionary i think it helps the private sector when government [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1586.8s)]
*  gets cut right uh however because sax that means the private sector gets to service that function [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1589.84s)]
*  the government won't be consuming all these resources that the private sector could use [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1597.9199999999998s)]
*  better it also won't have as many government bureaucrats acting as brake pedals on the private [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1601.2s)]
*  sector so i kind of think that the government the the real economy will perform better with a smaller [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1607.04s)]
*  government however i i think the reason why it won't happen is because it's politically difficult [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1612.48s)]
*  it's extremely difficult to cut spending politically right right well i mean as we saw this cycle every [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1618.64s)]
*  single proposal seemed to be a payoff to different constituencies it was like right those lines got [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1624.4s)]
*  in the budget somehow right somebody somebody fought for every single line item in the budget [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1632.0s)]
*  some special interest and they're going to fight like hell to keep their appropriation it's not [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1637.28s)]
*  even special interest it's the representatives in congress doing their job which is to fight for [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1642.0s)]
*  their constituents getting their fair share or their fair shake at the money that's being spent [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1647.68s)]
*  and that's just the way that the legislative branch has evolved over time if someone's getting [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1652.56s)]
*  something in order for me to vote for it i want to get something too and so the whole thing over [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1657.76s)]
*  time becomes functionally inflationary right i've seen it like i think that whole shell game might [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1661.84s)]
*  just be over now because there's no more money left i mean it's all been spent in fact you know [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1666.88s)]
*  what i mean so like all the federal government probably will end up doing in the near future is [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1672.72s)]
*  entitlements and defense that's it because those are the core core functions of federal government [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1679.1200000000001s)]
*  i think everything else that's that's sort of quote-unquote discretionary is probably [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1684.4s)]
*  going to get cut because there's no more money left tragedy of the commons folks everybody acting [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1688.8000000000002s)]
*  in their self-interest and yeah not a lot of coordination or ability to win office if you [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1694.72s)]
*  actually do what's in everybody's collective best interest and take the medicine moving on through [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1700.56s)]
*  the docket tech earnings this week google has a great quarter let's go over that a bit here your [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1705.84s)]
*  alma mater freberg they beat top line and bottom line stock popped five percent looks like cloud [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1712.24s)]
*  in youtube are the story here total revenue let this sink in 88.3 billion up 15 percent year-over-year [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1719.04s)]
*  search was uh 49 billion of that and their operating income is now up 34 percent year-over-year i think [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1727.28s)]
*  the cfo is getting some work done there 28.5 billion and net income was 26.3 billion interestingly [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1735.52s)]
*  people are expecting even larger profits they got a new cfo over there who said they could push a [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1744.64s)]
*  little further on cost cutting and she said the company will use ai to cut costs by streamlining [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1750.5600000000002s)]
*  workflows and managing headcount physical footprint i think that means more layoffs are coming to big [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1756.48s)]
*  tech youtube had a tremendous quarter ad revenue 8.9 billion chamath that's up 12 percent but sundar [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1762.64s)]

*  past year and so if you do a little uh botay math that's the back of the envelope math for those of [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1774.1599999999999s)]
*  you at home who haven't heard that acronym google doesn't report youtube's non-ad revenue but we [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1781.4399999999998s)]
*  know youtube had 35 billion in ad revenue over the last year that means they're doing about 15 billion [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1788.3999999999999s)]

*  quasi monopolies in the world they're all american and if we allow them to flourish [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1821.52s)]
*  we'll be good if we hamper them a little bit and allow other companies to pick up the white space [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1829.04s)]
*  will be great over to you okay there's your that's called analysis and if we break them up [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1837.04s)]
*  i think that you'll have a lot more the the sum is greater than the parts i mean clearly youtube [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1845.1999999999998s)]
*  would be one of the great companies right now if you take the perspective of if you own stock in [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1852.1599999999999s)]
*  any of these companies the some of the parts analysis would tell you that the breakup value [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1858.6399999999999s)]
*  is greater than the way that these companies get discounted you can look at the multiples [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1864.6399999999999s)]
*  that they trade at and you can see that so if you're a shareholder of the company you actually [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1869.76s)]
*  silently probably want them broken up because you'll get individual shares that are each will be [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1876.24s)]
*  worth more separately if you are a shareholder of the united states economy you also probably [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1880.1599999999999s)]
*  want them broken up because then you'll just have many more companies creating economic value which [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1886.8799999999999s)]
*  then drives the tax rolls which benefit the united states balance sheet it's hard to see [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1892.0s)]
*  unless you're an employee of the company or you derive a lot of ego from the existence of a [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1899.3600000000001s)]

*  point on two fronts in google's case both youtube and gcp required many many many many billions of [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1911.92s)]
*  dollars of investment over many years same with waymo by the way at this point that took a long [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1919.04s)]
*  time and a lot of capital to get the payback on if those were standalone businesses and they didn't [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1925.76s)]
*  have the profits being derived from search and ads over many years they would not have been able to [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1931.04s)]
*  build those incredible businesses so if you do break these businesses up what you do lose is the [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1936.24s)]
*  ability for an american juggernaut to be able just like amazon did with aws and apple did and we can [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1942.0s)]
*  go through the list to build these new businesses that require the cash flows from the old businesses [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1947.6s)]
*  as separate companies it becomes much harder to make that degree of an investment that you're [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1954.24s)]
*  that angle that angle of bellyaching is not going to pass muster because it's all about litigating [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1958.56s)]
*  the past and you got to play the ball where it lies where it lies is this business is in a position [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1964.0s)]
*  where you can probably demarcate four or five logical business units again i'm not saying today [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1970.32s)]
*  for sure but it will happen and and the argument of but the past is not going to work no no i'm [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1976.0s)]
*  not yeah i'm not disagreeing with your point about like hey if these things broke up people [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1981.28s)]
*  would make money i'm just i'm just trying to understand this point about american dynamism [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1984.5600000000002s)]
*  or whatever you want to call it that these companies are all in america they've all been [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1989.3600000000001s)]
*  successful because they've been led by amazing founders they've reinvested so much of the profit [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1992.8s)]
*  they've generated back into building insane new businesses that took a lot of capital and a lot [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=1997.6000000000001s)]
*  of time and eventually they paid off and they became the next generation of ginormous new [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2002.56s)]
*  businesses that would have not have possibly existed if not for the will and the cash flows [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2006.72s)]
*  coming from those old businesses but you also have a companion economy in the capital markets [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2012.08s)]
*  where there's hundreds of billions of dollars that go and fill in the gaps and i think the reality is [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2016.6399999999999s)]
*  the people in the capital markets are not stupid and if these big companies hadn't spent hundreds [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2021.44s)]
*  of billions of dollars the capital markets would have so i don't think that that if google let's [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2026.08s)]
*  just play a scenario and i'm not trying to relitigate the past but if google did not own youtube [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2031.28s)]
*  what do you think would have happened with youtube it would have gotten funded and it would have been [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2036.24s)]
*  fun it would have raised billions and the reason because you do you remember youtube had a real [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2039.28s)]
*  infrastructure problem under a serious lawsuit i think they would have shut down the reason is because [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2044.16s)]
*  people are smart enough to understand when then there's the potential to make money [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2049.92s)]
*  okay and the free markets do a really good job of highlighting where that's possible [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2055.7599999999998s)]
*  again there is no point relitigating this but i think it would have gotten funded yeah could [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2061.28s)]
*  gcp and aws get funded with 10 million dollars yeah because i guess that's what open is right why [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2066.48s)]
*  does why does core weave get funded today how is core weave allowed to even exist why doesn't it all [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2071.36s)]
*  go because investors are smart they see that there's an economic rationale for there being [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2076.4s)]
*  multiple players and then there's a smart founding team that creates a justification that gets it [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2081.76s)]
*  going so the era of the monopolies monopoly on building new monopolies is over [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2088.08s)]
*  i don't think it's i don't think it's ever existed but i think the point is that [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2095.52s)]
*  big businesses are there to eventually grow at gdp so that they can be disrupted by small companies [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2099.52s)]
*  that's what you want because if you had the same seven or eight companies then you could make the [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2105.68s)]
*  argument that we should have stopped at the east west india company and everything would have been [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2110.3199999999997s)]
*  great it's not true it is what we did with the railroads it's what we did with the at&t it's [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2114.08s)]
*  what we did with standard oil like when these when these monopolies were built in the u.s they were [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2120.24s)]
*  all broken up but hold on it's not necessarily what we did it's the boundary conditions that enabled [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2124.96s)]
*  other people to then go and fill the gaps and i think that that's a reasonable boundary conditions [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2129.36s)]
*  you know sax had this great tweet this past week and i almost quote tweeted it but i thought i don't [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2134.48s)]
*  want to create a lot more noise where there doesn't need to be sax is paying attention now [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2140.72s)]
*  but he had this tweet about taking back the licenses for the main broadcast channels and [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2145.52s)]
*  i thought that was an excellent thing and i quote tweeted something where i was like [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2151.9199999999996s)]
*  yeah we should buy that for all in and i said it half jokingly but i didn't because i think that [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2156.48s)]
*  if those licenses were up for grabs what would happen is a bunch of private equity people would [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2163.4399999999996s)]
*  get behind rogan a bunch of private equity people would get behind us and we would all bid [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2168.72s)]
*  and the outcome would be better so the point is that these small structural changes and i know [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2173.9199999999996s)]
*  that it may seem large to break up google it's not it's a small thing in the grand course of [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2179.8399999999997s)]
*  american business history it's not going to really matter that much would be good generally through [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2186.64s)]
*  the lens of the individual shareholder and through the lens of the shareholder of the united states [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2193.3599999999997s)]
*  that's it sax can you tell us about the broadcast licensing comment that you made i thought it was [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2197.68s)]
*  actually pretty good too yeah there's a history to this i mean originally in the u.s we had three [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2203.04s)]
*  major broadcast networks abc cbs mbc and they were given licenses of public spectrum from the fcc [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2208.08s)]
*  and those licenses were free but in exchange for them the major broadcast networks had these [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2217.6s)]
*  various requirements to serve the public interest to be fair this was pre-cable and this was [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2222.16s)]
*  right this goes back like 100 years just to be i think it's important to be clear because i don't [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2229.52s)]
*  think everyone understands it back in the day all the tv networks only broadcast over the air so they [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2234.48s)]
*  needed radio spectrum allocated to them to do that which was a you know 100 year old kind of [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2240.0s)]
*  that's a hundred year old situation doesn't exist anymore sorry it was the only way to get information [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2246.08s)]
*  broadcast on tv was through this this public spectrum and so it kind of made sense in a world [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2251.6s)]
*  in which there were only three networks because that was the only way to get information to have [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2260.0s)]
*  these fairness requirements and public interest requirements and so it was heavily regulated [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2265.8399999999997s)]
*  well now it's a century later and there's so many ways to get information you've got cable obviously [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2272.0s)]
*  meant that we went from three or four networks to hundreds and then of course you've got the [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2278.08s)]
*  internet and you've got streaming so there's now an infinite number of ways to get information in [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2284.0s)]
*  real time including video and that sort of thing you've also got social networks you've got x [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2290.16s)]
*  and all the rest so there's no shelf space limit anymore there's no scarcity and so therefore [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2297.04s)]
*  therefore tying up this very valuable spectrum by giving it for free to the to the broadcast [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2304.8799999999997s)]
*  networks just doesn't really make sense in the same way and what we should do is just auction [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2312.0s)]
*  off this spectrum use the money to pay down the national debt and in that way it'll go to its [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2317.9199999999996s)]
*  most highly valued use the market will figure out what that use is if the broadcast networks are the [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2325.68s)]
*  most highly valued way to use this spectrum then they'll win the auction but i suspect they [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2331.92s)]
*  won't it doesn't make sense they did this auction in 2016 right for 15 years they've been gradually [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2337.04s)]
*  auctioning off more spectrum but we're talking about here this is like the most choice valuable [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2342.16s)]
*  part of of public spectrum so for example one of the reasons why the spectrum is valuable is because [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2348.8s)]
*  it can easily go through walls right like you can watch your tv inside your house and this [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2357.28s)]
*  broadcast spectrum is good at getting through those walls imagine the types of gps apps you [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2362.6400000000003s)]
*  could enable with that kind of precision right so there's many other ways in theory that this [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2369.36s)]
*  spectrum could be used and you would be able to unleash i think a lot of innovation in next [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2374.6400000000003s)]
*  generation wireless apps if the spectrum were available i don't think the public would lose [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2381.0400000000004s)]
*  anything because abc cbs mbc first of all i mean these networks are basically a commodity now [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2385.28s)]
*  there's so many other ways to get news and they'll still be available through the internet and through [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2392.0s)]
*  cable so you're saying to speed up these auctions because they do occur every 15 years or something [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2396.7200000000003s)]
*  to that i think what happens is that the the licenses are actually granted to local stations [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2403.44s)]
*  like your you know your local abc or whatever [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2410.5600000000004s)]
*  yeah and then collectively they have a lobby called the nab or national association of broadcasters [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2416.0s)]
*  and this is why they have so much power is you've got all these local networks let's call three or [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2422.0800000000004s)]
*  four in every geography and they all come together as part of this lobby and so this is why nothing [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2426.48s)]
*  ever changes but does this model still make sense no i mean it's completely obsolete but those local [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2432.0800000000004s)]
*  networks will all go crazy if they lose their free spectrum well they pay for it they don't [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2438.56s)]
*  they don't pay for it now they get a free license from the fcc in exchange for the fairness requirement [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2445.36s)]
*  these other requirements i think that they pay billions of dollars for these and like hundreds [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2450.96s)]
*  of millions on a local no every six years or so they come back up and they get renewed by the fcc [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2457.2799999999997s)]
*  i was just talking about the spectrum auctions i'm looking at it that's different yeah okay [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2463.52s)]
*  all right interesting no look the fcc has auction spectrum before but not the spectrum that the [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2469.12s)]
*  broadcast networks are sitting on which is some of the most valuable spectrum got it and the only [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2475.84s)]
*  reason why it's being used this way is because of legacy because this is how it worked 100 years ago [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2480.96s)]
*  well and then this parallels into i think some of the research that's going on right now around [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2487.52s)]
*  legacy media and trust in media a bunch of reports have been coming out about this it's not shocking [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2493.36s)]
*  to anybody who listens to this podcast but confidence in institutions is tracked by a [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2499.2000000000003s)]
*  number of different organizations gallup being one of them and if we look at how americans feel [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2504.64s)]
*  and trust has generally been going down in everything the military it's also being it's [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2512.1600000000003s)]
*  also being tracked in the wapo op-ed section yeah exactly and we're gonna pull that up jacob [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2518.88s)]
*  do you have that or no uh yeah we'll talk about that yeah okay but here if you take a look at [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2524.8s)]
*  from 2021 2022 and into 2023 television news went from 16 down to 11 and back up to 14 [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2530.4s)]
*  but is amongst the lowest in terms of trust in and 40 percent of americans have no trust in media [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2539.6s)]
*  at all according to this gala poll here's how it breaks down by party republican independent and [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2550.4s)]
*  democrats confidence by the democrats 58 independence 29 publicans 11 percent [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2558.3199999999997s)]
*  in mass media your thoughts friedberg as we look at just trust in general in institutions [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2568.3999999999996s)]
*  this transitionary period we're in and specifically the media i do think we've talked about this a [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2575.7599999999998s)]
*  number of times in the past so without rehashing too much i think that many of the institutions [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2581.6s)]
*  that have offered media have had to move away from providing data and information because data [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2588.7999999999997s)]
*  and information has commoditized it's available broadly through the internet and other places [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2593.68s)]
*  so the actual gathering of information is now democratized you know agencies put their data on [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2597.8399999999997s)]
*  their website stock stock markets are published on the internet so the internet has democratized [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2603.8399999999997s)]
*  access to information so the media companies that have historically been arbiters of information [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2608.08s)]
*  have had to become effectively content businesses they've had to provide more than just information [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2613.6s)]
*  and what has happened is a iterative feedback system whereby the more kind of angry they can [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2620.08s)]
*  make someone the more upset they can make someone the the more emotive they can make a reader or a [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2628.64s)]
*  viewer or a listener the more clicks they get the more the kind of limbic system triggers that [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2634.16s)]
*  consumer to come back and consume some more of their media and so the iterative development [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2640.24s)]
*  cycle is that things look like they're one side versus another side in nearly every context in [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2644.9599999999996s)]
*  every piece of media everyone is opinionated and making a position point from a side from a [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2649.52s)]
*  perceived side that they are representing because it is emotive to the readers and the readers come [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2655.7599999999998s)]
*  back and they align with that side and they want to have more of that because it incites their limbic [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2660.24s)]
*  system tribalism happened and as a result when people look at it and assume that it's what it [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2664.3999999999996s)]
*  used to be which is objective truth fact-finding information gathering and it is not that they're [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2669.76s)]
*  like well this isn't even news anymore and the truth is it's not because information is democratized [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2674.8s)]
*  it's available to you anywhere and everywhere you want it you can get it through citizen journalism [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2680.4s)]
*  via blogs via podcasts via twitter via many other places and so the the legacy media companies have [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2684.6400000000003s)]
*  effectively become emotive content companies in order to drive clicks drive views sell ads that's [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2692.0s)]
*  really all this whole story is and i don't think that that's going to shift i don't think that [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2697.44s)]
*  jeff bezos's attempt to try and return wapo back to being a fact-finding organization is going to [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2701.04s)]
*  be successful i think all the consumers that read wapo today they love the one-sided nature they [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2706.32s)]
*  love the bias that they read it makes them feel good i think that the people that work there love [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2712.08s)]
*  the bias they love writing those opinion pieces it makes them feel good i don't think anyone [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2716.8s)]
*  actually wants boring news anymore because you know what they can go to a website from the [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2721.28s)]
*  government itself or from a company itself and just read the information and frankly if they [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2725.68s)]
*  want to get unbiased honest factual information there's a hundred other sources well and then [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2730.16s)]
*  here and the commentary the comment yeah the commentary about off the cuff etc you know what [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2734.64s)]
*  that is that's called authentic conversation that is how people speak when we all get together we [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2739.2799999999997s)]
*  are not journalists we are not necessarily well versed let's be honest we mess things up a lot [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2745.7599999999998s)]
*  we say off the cuff comments that are wrong very often but that's just how people speak and it [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2750.8s)]
*  feels authentic and when we do have signal i think that listeners and viewers are smart enough to [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2755.6800000000003s)]
*  separate that signal from noise and they are going to make their own decisions about what they find [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2760.2400000000002s)]
*  to be truth and factual and what they're going to use to make decisions in their life and that's i [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2765.36s)]
*  think how people want to consume information now it's not being told what the truth is by some fake [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2769.84s)]
*  authority and here is a clip from the podcast last year podcast could play a huge role just like [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2775.12s)]
*  in 2016 social media broke through and played a huge role yeah i think in 2024 i think that [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2781.92s)]
*  podcast could break podcast will decide the election the way that unorthodox candidates [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2787.44s)]
*  get their message out it could be the way all candidates get their message out we're moving [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2792.0s)]
*  from traditional media defining these candidates to direct to consumer direct through twitter [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2796.0s)]
*  direct through podcasts this podcast included what we're witnessing right now is the transition [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2803.76s)]
*  from traditional media and the establishment defining who the great candidates are to the [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2809.04s)]
*  public and the people on podcasts and social media who are the tip of the spear on the vanguard [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2814.6400000000003s)]
*  they're going to pick the winners i love you both you guys totally nailed it look at that sacks your [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2820.08s)]
*  thoughts on this sort of transition interestingly as we know rogan had trump on over 40 million [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2825.92s)]
*  views now i think they're up to 100 million views now for that rogan trump interview oh including [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2832.72s)]
*  it's i'm sure you literally cannot find it if you search for it in google or youtube it's quite [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2837.7599999999998s)]
*  well we'll get to that in a second yeah that's an interesting one i got to take on that but [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2842.24s)]
*  what do you take from rogan getting let's say many more views than the last two presidential debates [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2846.0s)]
*  trump harris 67 million viewers trump biden 51 million viewers i think maybe rogan combined [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2854.9599999999996s)]
*  with his two episodes will get more than the first two debates yeah look i think this is the [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2862.24s)]
*  first podcast election where you can make the argument that podcasts will decide the election [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2869.4399999999996s)]
*  and there's a couple of reasons for that one is podcasts have gone big enough that there's [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2875.52s)]
*  enough audience that they just have the reach now to play a big role second the format is [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2879.12s)]
*  is highly informative to viewers you get to see a candidate expound in long form being asked [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2886.48s)]
*  questions and having to go for potentially hours at a time i mean trump went for three hours with [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2893.7599999999998s)]
*  rogan impressive it's very hard to hide who you are when you're going for that period of time in [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2899.68s)]
*  an unscripted environment i would argue even the hour that trump spent with us demonstrated that [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2904.64s)]
*  he knew a lot more about policy issues than people were giving him credit for and it's and [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2911.52s)]
*  it also showed his personality was a lot different than the media had portrayed him so i think that [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2916.32s)]
*  podcasts have been a great advantage for trump he's been willing to do them and i think he does them [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2922.08s)]
*  quite well i think it's particularly helpful to him in a context where the legacy media has been [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2928.0s)]
*  trying to portray him as a very extreme figure as as literally a nazi or literally the reincarnation [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2935.52s)]
*  of adolf hitler when the media is is telling the audience that you're that and then you can go on [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2941.92s)]
*  rogan for three hours and show that you're a normal funny guy who actually knows a lot about [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2947.68s)]
*  policy it's just such a different impression than what the media is trying to portray that has been [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2952.4s)]
*  incredibly i think useful and advantageous for trump by the same token kamala harris has not [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2958.16s)]
*  been willing to do rogan at least not on rogan's terms apparently she was willing to sit down for [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2964.4s)]
*  one hour with him but but not in austin according to not in austin what rogan said is no we have to [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2970.64s)]
*  sit down in our studio for three hours so far she hasn't been willing to do that i think that speaks [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2976.08s)]
*  volumes in and of itself is that she hasn't been willing to subject herself to the same sort of [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2982.1600000000003s)]
*  you could call it an interrogation or really just long-form conversation that trump has been willing [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2988.7200000000003s)]
*  to but in any event just i think my bottom line on this is that i think trump's biggest challenge [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2993.2s)]
*  in this election is just to get people comfortable with the idea of a second trump term to get people [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=2998.96s)]
*  comfortable with him and i think that him going on all these podcasts including ours including i [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3007.4399999999996s)]
*  thought the andrew schultz one was really good too has helped him i think just get people comfortable [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3013.68s)]
*  with the idea of of trump which i think was just his biggest obstacle in this election because [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3017.7599999999998s)]
*  people definitely want to change and they're not happy with biden harris you know the one thing [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3022.24s)]
*  i'll say is before you go on rogan there's a sense of anxiety that i had which was do i have [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3026.4799999999996s)]
*  enough interesting things to say for three hours that was really at the top of my mind i think [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3037.04s)]
*  jason i talked to you right before yeah i went on and that was a big thing for me and then you go [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3041.9199999999996s)]
*  and you get in the seat and he's incredible in the way that he kind of like moves the conversation [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3049.52s)]
*  along and then you end up you're like oh it's already been three hours that's his superpower [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3055.04s)]
*  the reason that she should find a way to go to austin and do it is because he has the ability [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3062.32s)]
*  to allow you to be your true self over a long period of time and i think again just going back [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3069.36s)]
*  to the basics she deserves for herself for the american people to vote up or down [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3076.72s)]
*  who she really is and all the campaign strategists aside and all of the other nonsense aside [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3083.7599999999998s)]
*  i would want if i was running for president one shot at people being able to see me for who i [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3090.64s)]
*  really am and that's why she should go on rogan i think she's afraid of that i mean she has [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3097.6s)]
*  mostly ducked media interviews and ducked any podcast that would be perceived as [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3104.32s)]
*  ever she's definitely gone with the friends but she stopped she stopped docking them i think in [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3110.32s)]
*  fairness to her like maybe after she was like in the third or fourth week she started yeah she's [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3115.04s)]
*  done call me daddy she's done howard sturt she's done the ones that she knew would be super friendly [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3119.36s)]
*  yeah of course yeah doing adversarial is probably that trump did our show because he thought it would [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3123.52s)]
*  be friendly yeah he started with friendlies yeah yeah why would you do opposition when trump did i [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3129.52s)]
*  mean we were on the first podcast he went on well we're the first on that fox she went on that fox [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3134.48s)]
*  news thing she did fox news for 26 minutes free bergen her staff was waving they were on the [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3138.96s)]
*  sidelines waving frantically to get her off of there um but in any event was was were we the [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3144.08s)]
*  first podcast to interview trump second and elk boys were first i guess we were second [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3150.16s)]
*  uh-huh i think that it was really unclear what would happen when you you know put a major [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3156.48s)]
*  can of her president on a podcast for an hour at the time he did it i think he took a little bit [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3163.2799999999997s)]
*  of a risk um and i think it worked out for him and then he's done a lot more since then i mean [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3166.96s)]
*  other than rogan rogan and us have consistently tried to get everybody on all sides to be on the [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3171.68s)]
*  podcast i think we did a really good job looking back on we've gotten everybody except one person [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3178.7999999999997s)]
*  comel airs yeah i mean i wish i had time to have asked him all the gems january 6th that was the [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3184.08s)]
*  only thing i didn't get to on my question we had all the independents and we had all the credible [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3190.16s)]
*  republicans and to his credit we were the first for rfk right we were the first with yeah he [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3194.8s)]
*  credits us first for dean phillips dean phillips and vivek first for the first for that i can say [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3201.12s)]
*  yeah give us some some credit there on the um search issue i looked into that there [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3208.4s)]
*  vivek sorry i always get that wrong the search issue there was some complaints that youtube [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3213.6800000000003s)]
*  might have been like i don't know hiding the video which didn't make much sense to people so i did an [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3219.36s)]
*  investigation of that sax you're laughing go ahead well i should finish what you're saying no no i [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3224.4s)]
*  have a different point of view than you on this but i didn't even get my point of view i know i've [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3231.6s)]
*  seen it on twitter but keep going oh well no i did um a search on bang defend google i know no [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3235.04s)]
*  no i'm not defending google i'm just explaining to people how search works independent of it i [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3241.6s)]
*  went to bang duck duck go search.brave.com google youtube google video and what people don't [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3245.68s)]
*  understand about how the search algorithms work is they are designed to increase advertising [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3254.08s)]
*  dollars and freeberg will back me up this he worked at google and session link that's the goal [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3260.32s)]
*  am i correct freeberg with algorithms whether it's tiktok, youtubes, etc. yeah i'm not going to [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3266.56s)]
*  increase session time increase revenue i know more about search results i don't know as much [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3273.04s)]
*  about the video stuff so when you look at that it's it's a very nuanced thing but joe rogan doesn't [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3277.2000000000003s)]
*  monetize his search it is not make any money for them and then clips do make money for youtube and [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3282.56s)]
*  the clips have flooded the zone so if you do a search on any search engine whether it's bang or [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3290.88s)]
*  brave or duck duck go google or youtube any of them what you'll find is the clips beat out the main [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3297.44s)]
*  episodes all the time this happens to our podcast when people clip our podcast they will do keyword [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3305.04s)]
*  stuffing and they'll beat us and it will beat the algorithm because the algorithm wants to get ads [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3310.16s)]
*  and we don't have ads turned on either so people have this frequent frustration with this week in [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3315.92s)]
*  startups my other podcasts all in here and joe rogan that anything that's not monetized on youtube [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3320.64s)]
*  doesn't rank high and if you look all of the clips and this makes sense if you just think logically [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3326.96s)]
*  the clips will will generate more engagement because you get to watch the highlights so it's [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3334.16s)]
*  kind of like sports highlights sax would you like to conspiracy theory this and tell us that sergue [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3340.3999999999996s)]
*  is sandbagging for the democrats or something by hiding the youtube conspiracy theory you can just [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3345.44s)]
*  i mean if you go to google every single day and just type in a trump related search term versus a [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3350.7999999999997s)]
*  comal related search term you'll see the difference in coverage but back to the the rogan thing look [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3357.2799999999997s)]
*  google is a search engine this is what they're supposed to be good at you have an interview [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3362.88s)]
*  between the biggest podcaster in the world and a former president who's probably the most famous [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3366.96s)]
*  person in the world it's massively trending it's got something like 100 million views at the time [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3371.6s)]
*  that people noticed that you couldn't find it on youtube it already had something like 34 million [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3376.8s)]
*  views what i'm saying is you have to work pretty hard as a search engine for your algorithm to be [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3381.36s)]
*  so bad that you can't find that interview okay when i went to youtube and tried to find it at [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3387.76s)]
*  first i typed in trump rogan interview couldn't find it then i typed trump rogan interview podcast [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3392.4s)]
*  couldn't find it was just clubs there was trump rogan full interview full podcast still couldn't [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3400.1600000000003s)]
*  find it there's no question that just as a factual matter this episode was suppressed in youtube [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3405.92s)]
*  search if you went to the main google search engine and did a similar search what you would [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3412.2400000000002s)]
*  have found as the number one search result was an article from the arizona republic which is a [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3417.04s)]
*  publication i've never even heard of that would have told you that the rogan interview with trump [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3423.7599999999998s)]
*  was a brain-rotted waste of three hours that's the number one result somehow google decides that [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3428.48s)]
*  his number one result for the rogan interview was this arizona republic story okay i i mean that is [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3434.4s)]
*  not a search engine doing its job so it's pretty obvious to me that they're using other factors [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3441.84s)]
*  in deciding what to surface here and somehow the results end up being almost universally negative [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3449.44s)]
*  towards trump and almost universally positive towards kamala i think you've got to at this [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3456.96s)]
*  point have your head buried really deep in the sand not to think that google is incredibly biased [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3461.84s)]
*  in this election against trump let me pull up some facts to show how wrong you are if you pull [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3468.64s)]
*  up youtube here here's an image of the youtube search results that i just did for the trump rogan [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3475.7599999999998s)]
*  and what you'll see is as i explained previously clips perform better and make money they make [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3482.24s)]
*  money so the algorithm favors those and what you'll see here is fox news etc and all these clips and [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3488.4s)]
*  then eventually you get to the joe rogan interview and if you look at bing search results for rogan [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3493.52s)]
*  trump interview what you'll see is all the search engines put news up first then they go to organic [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3497.68s)]
*  so it's just a fundamental misunderstanding of how search is designed for users they start with news [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3503.52s)]
*  on every search engine today and then here's google's same thing and then what you'll see here is [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3510.3999999999996s)]
*  on the google and on the bing images you have a collection you know typically five or six news [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3516.0s)]
*  stories then they go to the first organic so people just don't understand how search works it's always [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3521.2799999999997s)]
*  news first when you type in a politician's name and then when you look at the news or you it has [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3526.16s)]
*  new york post right leaning you have people who are dead center like ap in there and you have fox [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3531.7599999999998s)]
*  news there in the google one so of the first five two of them are right leaning and ap is obviously [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3537.2799999999997s)]
*  in the middle forbes i don't know maybe forbes is right leaning to freeberg over to you well i was [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3543.68s)]
*  going to say i read somewhere so i have no direct knowledge about this i actually pinged several [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3549.7599999999998s)]
*  people at google to ask them what was going on and i did not get a clear response i didn't i so like [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3555.04s)]
*  i have no insight as to what actually happened but what i read online somewhere was that someone [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3559.76s)]
*  reported that someone at google said that there were there was kind of a whole bunch of people [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3565.44s)]
*  that clicked inappropriate content flagging on the video so like anti-trump people went to the video [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3571.84s)]
*  clicked that it was inappropriate and when when youtube gets that many people clicking that this [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3578.64s)]
*  is inappropriate it automatically mass flagging yes it's a it is a it is a technique people will [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3583.6s)]
*  use they've used it on our program here where they find right so if you get like a million people [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3589.68s)]
*  that say at once like hey there's inappropriate content in here the default is to hide the video [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3593.6s)]
*  well to hide the video from search results while it's investigated but clearly there's something [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3599.68s)]
*  messed up here because they should have been on top of that and responded immediately with a video [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3604.08s)]
*  that has such a large number of views and such a large audience to allow that to happen and and [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3608.56s)]
*  drag on for so long but someone said that that may have been what happened and then they fixed it so [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3614.0s)]
*  i don't know but i just want to point that out that it may not necessarily have been [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3618.72s)]
*  uh kind of overt action by google but just the way that the system is set up that anyone can flag [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3623.36s)]
*  and if enough people flag you get this and i can tell you i know firsthand that google is aware of [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3627.7599999999998s)]
*  the claims of bias and i think you're starting to see it just like cnn is aware of the claims [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3632.88s)]
*  of bias and the added cnn is aware of the terms of bias i mean like all these companies are super [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3639.12s)]
*  sensitive to it so is facebook mark zuckerberg's very sensitive to it i know sundar himself is very [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3643.92s)]
*  sensitive to it i don't want to kind of hide the fact that these people think that they're going [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3649.44s)]
*  out and being biased that they have these kind of information empires because they know that they're [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3653.04s)]
*  going to lose trust and they're going to lose customers and revenue and etc cnn has done i [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3657.6800000000003s)]
*  think an exceptional job i don't know if you watch it at all sax but they have been having trump [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3662.56s)]
*  supporters and right wing commentators in cnn on the desk they have every yes it's really changed [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3668.16s)]
*  the nature of it from being like ms nbc or fox did you know that something i didn't know that [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3674.08s)]
*  i've never watched i never watched i never watched these shows but like before we go off on this [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3679.6s)]
*  topic people throughout this election have been posting google search results when you just type [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3683.2799999999997s)]
*  in trump versus harris and i've done it every single time it's massively biased i mean let's [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3688.56s)]
*  just go through them this was a search result i got months ago where i just typed in donald trump [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3695.04s)]
*  and you the first carousel was about kamala harris i remember joking on the pod that if you want to [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3700.4s)]
*  find the latest news about kamala harris just search for donald trump and then you go down [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3706.08s)]
*  and the first carousel that's about trump is negative stories this one was about project [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3711.52s)]
*  2025 which has nothing to do with trump nonetheless this is a major democratic talking point [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3716.4s)]
*  at the time is that somehow that project 2025 is what trump would do in a second term i just did [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3721.44s)]
*  this and it's different now obviously this is you said this is a few months old i've been doing this [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3727.28s)]
*  on a recurring basis over the last few months and the point is that whenever you search for the [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3731.6800000000003s)]
*  candidates the news is very positive towards harris and it's very negative towards trump and [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3737.84s)]
*  even when you search for trump they'll give you positive news about harris now go to the [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3744.56s)]
*  go to the podcast and again sex you don't you don't think this is a function of the fact that [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3748.0s)]
*  so many media outlets are being so negative about trump and positive about harris and so therefore [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3752.16s)]
*  the ratios just how does the arizona republic end up being the first choice when you search for [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3756.24s)]
*  rogan trump they're not you know like page rank can't explain that they're just not a major [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3761.36s)]
*  publication they're not being linked to by a lot of people doesn't make any sense here's another [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3766.48s)]
*  example okay stay on this one for a second this was after trump went on the andrew schultz podcast [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3770.96s)]
*  that podcast was a very positive experience for him as we just talked about helped his campaign a [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3777.68s)]
*  lot what's the number one result when you look at for that new republic podcast host laughing trump [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3783.12s)]
*  face as he struggles to defend rambling that's when he had that hilarious story about the weave [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3788.7200000000003s)]
*  if you actually watch the clip the podcast hosts were they were definitely laughing with him they [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3793.84s)]
*  were not laughing at him that was a ridiculous mischaracterization the new republic is not the [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3798.48s)]
*  objective source for anything i don't know how you could say that objectively page rank should get you [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3804.2400000000002s)]
*  to the new republic as the number one source for the andrew schultz interview of trump that is bias [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3811.04s)]
*  i mean it's just biased there's been so many examples of google giving these ridiculous results [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3818.0s)]
*  and they find obscure publications and obscure articles that have no basis in the truth to [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3825.04s)]
*  elevate to the top it's almost like they're trying to find the most negative article they can find [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3832.08s)]
*  on trump and make that the number one result yeah it's not the search engine it's just the [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3837.04s)]
*  corpus of media that's being indexed if you look here at google why is it in your times then [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3842.16s)]
*  that's the number one thing well i mean just you know here if you look at donald trump you know if [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3848.0s)]
*  we were to look at these new sources there's nbc npr politico and new york times are left-leaning [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3853.6s)]
*  if you were to do this on um i think i have bang as the next one you can open and you can look at [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3859.8399999999997s)]
*  the next one nick which is duck duck go in all of these cases the problem is only three or four [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3865.2s)]
*  percent of journalists at publications today are right-leaning and most of the right-leaning [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3870.48s)]
*  publications are opinion publications like fox etc and so you just you don't have a lot of [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3875.68s)]
*  representation in the index of republicans and that's like a big opportunity i think for [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3881.68s)]
*  republicans is to make more publications or take more publications over like we're seeing with the [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3886.3999999999996s)]
*  la times and washington post which i think are going to serve publications if google would choose to [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3890.56s)]
*  surface them but it decides that it doesn't want to it's on a percentage basis it's very small is [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3896.64s)]
*  the problem here you go this is a arizona republic rocketing to the top of search results for joe [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3902.0s)]
*  rogan trump interview that's a publication that is local to arizona that no one's ever heard of [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3907.28s)]
*  it has no basis being the number one result in google new york times is second okay i can see the [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3912.2400000000002s)]
*  logic of that because new york times is a big publication then you go down one row to the [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3917.84s)]
*  carousel oh there's new republic again why because it's calling trump appearing on joe rogan shady [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3922.96s)]
*  and then you've got another one listen another one there from the independent yeah calling trump a [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3929.44s)]
*  predator i mean come on this is ridiculous okay so you've shared these examples um what i what i [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3933.44s)]
*  would recommend is i think we get someone from google on the show we could arrange that and they [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3939.28s)]
*  can kind of talk about the algorithm works because i don't think any of us are going to be able to [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3942.7200000000003s)]

*  there's some kind of manual intervention in this in this process maybe it can be kind of discussed [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3952.4s)]
*  and talked about why and how and you know what the automation is that causes this to happen and let's [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3957.44s)]
*  just try let's try and let's try and i'll take that as a to do and i'll try and find someone [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3962.16s)]

*  with a lot of people over there and i have heard from a lot of folks that this is a real issue that [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3971.2s)]
*  folks are trying to address internally so that there's this perception of bias that they're [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3976.72s)]
*  trying to get rid of and they really want to address it this is what i've heard from people [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3980.08s)]
*  at google i want to give them a chance to come and talk about pull up the banger sent you look [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3983.68s)]
*  rather than having us all debated or i don't even have a strong point of view on this i'd rather [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3987.52s)]
*  just bring someone in and talk about it so just a counterpoint here nick pull up the thing i just [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3990.96s)]
*  did for donald trump and we'll just if you do it as an exercise that's always the way to find the [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=3994.32s)]

*  oh brave perplexity thing perplex well yeah you could do that as well we'll see but anyway if you [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4002.08s)]

*  so that is more to my point that the entire corpus of news reportage is 95 percent left-leaning [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4021.8399999999997s)]
*  that's what's happening here and so they need to they're going to need to manually sax say these [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4029.7599999999998s)]
*  five percent should get represented 50 50 in the search results to please the other side even though [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4036.64s)]
*  that's not what the corpus is and the number of stories written by left-leaning just is probably [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4043.6s)]
*  50 to one to right leaning moving on through i have an alternate explanation can we just [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4048.96s)]
*  put this this just got some data i'd like just pull up this data if i could if you look at [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4055.12s)]
*  employee donations to party we've looked at tech companies it's all 90 something percent [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4059.52s)]
*  goes to democrats separate that's a pretty simple explanation for why the google search results are [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4065.12s)]
*  horribly biased in one direction uber's 18 percent [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4071.92s)]
*  all right let's go to our final segment here we'll talk a little bit about the election [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4077.12s)]
*  why don't you tee us up here freebird all right guys i'll quickly uh introduce our final political [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4082.32s)]
*  election update before our live stream on tuesday obviously a lot of daily freak out daily efforts [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4089.36s)]
*  at having an october surprise that will take down the other side all sorts of drama all sorts of [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4100.56s)]
*  insult not a lot of love in america right now super depressing and sad all sorts of stuff happened [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4105.52s)]
*  this week jay cal why don't you kick us off what do you think is going to happen on tuesday what [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4111.200000000001s)]
*  are the things that you think are going to move people between now and then it's a toss-up i mean [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4115.120000000001s)]
*  that's what everybody's saying it looks like trump's got a slight lead so i think it's going to be a [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4118.8s)]
*  toss-up sex agreed are we 65 35 as polymarket predicts or are we 100 Trump are we 90 [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4122.96s)]
*  Kamala Harris what are we uh well you definitely can't say it's gonna be 100 anyone i mean [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4132.400000000001s)]
*  but if again if you look at all the data the data is definitely pointing towards trump having an [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4137.6s)]
*  advantage it's obviously the prediction markets are almost two to one in favor of trump the polling [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4141.92s)]
*  shows that trump is ahead narrowly in this in all the swing states i think every single one of them [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4147.4400000000005s)]
*  even the sort of blue wall states of pennsylvania michigan wisconsin that harris must win i think in [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4152.0s)]
*  order to have a path to victory whereas michigan and wisconsin are very very close like one percent [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4158.96s)]
*  or less in the swing state polls pennsylvania polling shows that trump is ahead by i think two [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4166.8s)]
*  or three that's what i've seen today so it's it is looking good for trump and if you look at the [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4172.88s)]
*  numbers that elon's group the that america pack put out it looks like the early voting in pennsylvania [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4177.6s)]
*  is trending 500 000 votes better for republicans in the early voting than four years ago but sex [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4186.160000000001s)]
*  is that just pulling votes forward because some folks have said yeah it could be however instead [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4195.68s)]
*  of showing up at the ballot box on tuesday a lot of folks are doing mail ins and making sure they [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4200.160000000001s)]
*  get their vote in and mail instead of going in person so then you got to look at polling of people [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4204.56s)]
*  who say they're going to vote but haven't voted yet in pennsylvania who say they're going to vote [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4209.84s)]
*  on election day and i think those numbers are running about 18 points ahead for trump which is [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4214.56s)]
*  about double what he needs to win so he just to be clear the early voting favors harris but not by [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4221.200000000001s)]
*  the same percentages that it did four years ago so right now it looks like trump is cracking to [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4227.6s)]
*  win that state but look i can't guarantee it i'm not representing that you know that's exactly [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4235.76s)]
*  what's going to happen but right now the numbers are looking good remember biden only won pennsylvania [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4241.280000000001s)]
*  by 80 000 votes and again the swing so far is uh republicans are doing 500 000 votes better than [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4246.240000000001s)]
*  they were doing four years ago so there's a lot of stories coming out on twitter on independent [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4253.52s)]
*  media and on mainstream media or legacy media as we might call it now talking about hey i live at [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4258.400000000001s)]
*  a house i got 15 ballots mailed to me all with different random names and these sort of anecdotal [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4263.92s)]
*  stories are being pushed and then amplified by folks that are involved in the election [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4269.360000000001s)]
*  chamath is this kind of dangerous do we think that there really is a lot of this [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4275.360000000001s)]
*  kind of election meddling happening and if not or if there is is this kind of a dangerous thing [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4281.28s)]
*  to happen where a lot of people are talking about this where no matter what happens on [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4287.36s)]
*  tuesday people start to question the results of the election how much should we be kind of worried [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4290.5599999999995s)]
*  about this rhetoric i think there are two things there's the substance and then there's the strategy [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4295.04s)]
*  the substance is that does it really make sense that the most advanced and important country in [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4299.84s)]
*  the world doesn't have a uniform system where one ballot is given to every single [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4306.56s)]
*  american citizen who is eligible to vote that probably makes sense so we should probably just [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4315.68s)]
*  figure out how to do that separately the strategy of it is for both sides to lay the groundwork to [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4323.84s)]
*  say that this thing somehow wasn't totally right down the middle i am hoping for a very clear [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4330.24s)]
*  decisive victory and frankly whichever candidate wins i hope that it's very clear and decisive so [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4338.72s)]
*  that everybody is forced to de-escalate and move on now that said i think what the early voting data [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4346.639999999999s)]
*  shows is something that you haven't seen in the past which is that there are a lot of republican [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4356.0s)]
*  people that are voting early i don't know what that means for election day but typically it's [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4366.32s)]
*  the democrats that dominate these early voting processes and they build what's called the [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4371.84s)]
*  firewall and in these swing states these firewalls become very important going into election day [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4378.96s)]
*  and as sac said a bunch of these states are different than they've historically been in the [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4384.08s)]
*  favor of the republicans i saw an article today that just said that they've basically considered [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4390.48s)]
*  nevada now in the republican camp because like there's been so much early voting that it's about [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4397.12s)]
*  60 percent of the total votes i think have already been cast since they have a very [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4403.28s)]
*  clear republican lead going into election day so there's all kinds of stuff here that's [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4407.44s)]
*  new i just hope that it's just an absolutely crushing victory in one direction or the other [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4411.6s)]
*  so that we de-escalate and get get on to the business of running the country so i'm going to [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4416.400000000001s)]
*  break with my most my republican brethren on this and say i think early voting is actually a good [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4422.56s)]
*  thing it's it's very convenient right like why force people to only vote on just one day because [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4426.8s)]
*  what if you get sick or a kid gets sick and you have to pick them up from school there's a lot of [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4433.52s)]
*  things that can go wrong it is more convenient to have say two or three weeks to be able to cast [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4438.639999999999s)]
*  your vote i actually think that's not a bad thing and in terms of who it helps i'm not sure but [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4442.16s)]
*  i think that as republicans become more of a populist party and the democrats become more [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4447.759999999999s)]
*  of an elitist party i think higher turnout might actually might benefit republicans regardless i [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4451.759999999999s)]
*  think it's a huge convenience for voters and i think early voting is something that we should [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4458.4s)]
*  keep the thing we got to change is in the states where you don't have to present any voter id [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4463.68s)]
*  to show who you are this is crazy i mean you just you go up to the polling place and you give your [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4469.12s)]
*  name and i guess your address they look you up in a computer and they hand you a ballot [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4474.32s)]
*  and there's no verification that you're you are who you say you are that to me is crazy the other [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4478.400000000001s)]
*  thing that's crazy is that you can even get registered and added to the voter rolls in a lot [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4483.2s)]
*  of states without any proof of citizenship so there are states where you can go get a driver's [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4488.88s)]
*  license without proof of citizenship and there's just a checkbox to be added to the voter rolls [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4494.24s)]
*  and no one ever checks your citizen and now you're on the voter roll and you can go pick up your [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4500.08s)]
*  ballot without any voter id that's just crazy to me so i think that after this election there should [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4504.639999999999s)]
*  be some sort of bill that gets passed that's just crazy to me so i think that after this election [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4510.639999999999s)]
*  there should be some sort of bill that gets passed that gets passed and signed by the president that [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4517.44s)]
*  sets a minimum standard for for voter integrity for federal election for federal elections [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4523.679999999999s)]
*  right and do what they want right like each state can i guess they can do what they want but i don't [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4530.879999999999s)]
*  think states should be able to do whatever they want in federal elections because that affects all [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4534.799999999999s)]
*  of us i want to point out that each state is effectively voting for the folks that they want [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4537.919999999999s)]
*  is cast so that affects all of us if there's hold on if there's cheating in several states and in a [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4543.44s)]
*  close election by the way i'm not i'm not accusing that of happening okay i'm just saying that if we [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4549.759999999999s)]
*  have several states that don't have basic voter integrity i understand but that affects the outcome [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4555.599999999999s)]
*  of a national election that has a huge impact on all of us let's just talk about this really [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4562.48s)]
*  important point which i think a lot of folks ignore it's not a direct democracy it's not like [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4566.5599999999995s)]
*  everyone in the united states votes for the president what happens is the states send a bunch [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4570.72s)]
*  of electors to go vote for the president the each state casts a vote for the president how each state [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4575.84s)]
*  ultimately decides who they're going to vote for for president is through this kind of process that [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4582.320000000001s)]
*  we've kind of standardized across the states but each state is making a vote so shouldn't the states [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4586.8s)]
*  be able to kind of decide how they want to make their kind of voting process run internally to [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4591.6s)]
*  determine who the votes are that are going to go to the electoral college yeah i mean i think the [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4597.04s)]
*  constitution specifies that states will run their own elections and and i'm fine with that but what [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4600.72s)]
*  i'm saying is there needs to be a minimum standard to me the minimum standard is voter id and proof [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4605.12s)]
*  of citizenship to get registered i'm in strong agreement with sax on on this front and i've [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4610.16s)]
*  actually done a ton of research into it that i would like to share because i think this is an [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4615.5199999999995s)]
*  important service we can do here on the all-in podcast i think i had uh hans so as a die hard [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4619.6s)]
*  moderate you agree with sax i i i mean as an american i don't you know putting political [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4627.6s)]
*  parties aside i had hans von spakowski of the heritage foundation on this week in startups [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4633.04s)]
*  last tuesday you can watch it and they have spent a ton of money and time on election fraud and [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4639.120000000001s)]
*  obviously they're a partisan organization they found 1600 cases in 40 years it's about 40 a year [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4646.64s)]
*  they found 23 cases in 2020 none of them were in georgia you can go search those cases you'll [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4654.160000000001s)]
*  find cases like this one here that nick will pull up mirandee allen jumper who voted twice [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4661.04s)]
*  and the database is amazing anybody they're they're like crowdsourcing this and so putting all [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4666.160000000001s)]
*  partisan aside the heritage foundation is doing great work here because sunlight is the best [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4670.8s)]
*  disinfectant and what's really important for americans to understand is it is impossible [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4676.32s)]
*  right now absolutely statistically impossible to swing the presidential election with fraud [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4683.28s)]
*  the brennan center they're on the other side they did a report about voter fraud and they put it at [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4691.679999999999s)]
*  point 0003 and point 0025 percent and basically you've got a much greater chance of being struck [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4697.44s)]
*  by lightning and let's just do a little bit of math here 158 million people voted in 2020 we'll [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4705.919999999999s)]
*  have about 160 million this year if the estimates are correct and if you look at swing states [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4711.759999999999s)]
*  right that's where i think a lot of people are concerned oh what if they could swing it in [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4718.48s)]
*  georgia right and we all know from the famous phone call to brad raffensperger who's a republican [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4722.56s)]
*  secretary of state and trump said hey you know we've got to find these 11,780 votes that was the [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4729.120000000001s)]
*  winning margin so if we were to talk about that right can we compare it to what the heritage [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4734.8s)]
*  foundation found 1600 cases documented in 40 years about 40 a year now there could be a multiple of [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4739.120000000001s)]
*  that free birth 10 times 100 times but to find 11 000 ballots this would require in georgia [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4747.76s)]
*  for which has voter id and by the way voter id is in 35 of 50 states already after this election [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4757.360000000001s)]
*  it's going to hit 40 because it's just obvious that we all want that georgia requires you to [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4763.4400000000005s)]
*  have id to vote in person and you have to water and they've watermarked the ballots so in order [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4769.280000000001s)]
*  schumacher for somebody to do this they would have to fake 12 000 watermark ballots and have fake ids [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4774.96s)]
*  and have those 12 000 people not show up to vote and have two votes there then well looks like georgia [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4784.64s)]
*  has got a great system but we're talking about the states that don't like in california they just [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4791.28s)]
*  passed a law saying that you're not allowed to look at voter id right and so that obviously should [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4795.2s)]
*  change but the point is even in california which sorry california california did that why do you [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4800.24s)]
*  guys think such a law is passed what's the justification for that they want to not have [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4806.24s)]
*  somebody who had a chance to vote vote and it obviously benefits democrats if you believe that [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4812.72s)]
*  minorities don't have id in some greater population which people have rightly called out is racist [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4820.24s)]
*  and there is this concept that black people or hispanic people might not have ids to the same [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4826.72s)]
*  extent and they would lean democrat that is the cynical approach that people have taken but if we [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4832.48s)]
*  if we look at this it is impossible impossible to swing the federal election sorry jason you're [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4839.5199999999995s)]
*  saying it's a dei thing that's that's what people claim i'm not saying i think that's condescending [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4845.92s)]
*  and nonsense to act like minorities don't have a driver's license i mean that's ridiculous or [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4852.08s)]
*  some other form of id i think it's absolutely ridiculous i don't think there is a a good [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4856.72s)]
*  justification there's none for rejecting voter id and the law is even worse than that because it [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4862.32s)]
*  literally makes it illegal for someone to ask so if you go to a polling place in california they [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4867.68s)]
*  can't look at your id even if you say well i lost my ballot or something they just have to take your [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4872.64s)]
*  word for it you know there's a give you a new ballot there's a legal requirement for every [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4878.08s)]
*  employer when you hire somebody to make sure that that person is eligible to work in the united [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4882.24s)]
*  states if you're going to pay them legally right you get an i9 and they need to you know justify [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4887.84s)]
*  that they have a social security number that typically tells you whether you need a [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4894.08s)]
*  supplemental work authorization or not so if you do that for normal functional employment [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4899.12s)]
*  why wouldn't you do it for voting as well of course you need an id to get on a plane you need [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4905.6s)]
*  an id to buy a beer right you need an id to do all sorts of things in our society right so it's [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4910.64s)]
*  it's ludicrous i mean and voting is something where you should need an id because you have to [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4918.64s)]
*  say you have to match up that the person who's standing in front of you at the ballot box [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4922.8s)]
*  is the person on the voter rolls well why is it more important to make sure that the person sitting [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4927.52s)]
*  that the person sitting in 23b on the united flight is who he says it is but it's less important [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4932.88s)]
*  for someone to just walk in off the street and vote for the president of the united states why [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4940.88s)]
*  is that because people believe that certain communities may not have id and then they would [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4944.240000000001s)]
*  be not given the right to vote why don't why don't you allow people to just get on an airplane and [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4951.84s)]
*  just fly wherever they want like why don't yeah or or drive without a driver 100 yeah yeah [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4957.12s)]
*  I mean it's I'm not saying I agree with anything I'm telling you what people have said is the reason [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4962.72s)]
*  I think it's it's cover I think that's total nonsense I think it's actually if you think [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4967.92s)]
*  about it's insulting to minority groups to imply that they're incapable of getting a voter when you [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4971.68s)]
*  say when you say people you're saying people in charge the people in charge of California this is [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4976.56s)]
*  what they think yes and it turns out it's not what they think you didn't have voter cheating [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4982.320000000001s)]
*  we haven't had voter id they wanted not every state has governed idea that isn't a driver's [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4988.0s)]
*  license is this Gavin Newsom yeah right so this is Gavin Newsom [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=4996.0s)]
*  it's obvious to see what the effect this is going to be which is it makes it easier to engage in [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5001.6s)]
*  cheating do you guys think if Gavin Newsom was on an airplane and we said half these people here [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5007.84s)]
*  have just bought a ticket but we didn't check their ids would he get off the plane or stay on [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5014.56s)]
*  the plane do you think right and TSA requires ids so that they can do a check on everyone [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5020.320000000001s)]
*  make sure they're not on a do not fly list and all that sort of stuff there's consensus that [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5024.72s)]
*  everybody wants voter id I think you can kind of think about a there's a do not fly list [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5029.04s)]
*  and there should be a do not vote list like if you're not a citizen you should be on the do not [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5033.84s)]
*  vote list meaning you have to be on the I can vote list in order to vote seems pretty reasonable [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5037.6s)]
*  you know the fact that we've got a lot of federal agencies checking ids to determine whether you can [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5043.36s)]
*  or can't do something there is no way to swing the election even if there is a moderate amount [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5047.76s)]
*  that's that is the most important people for people to take out of you're not worried about [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5053.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't know how you can draw that conclusion if people can cheat then you can swing an election [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5056.96s)]
*  you can draw it statistically based upon what I've just said which is the smallest race is 11,779 [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5060.72s)]
*  remember when Trump asked them to find those votes do you remember that you're talking about [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5069.84s)]
*  the state of Georgia which I think actually has the closest race integrity we're talking about [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5076.0s)]
*  the state of California here I know that's the closest race just passed along just in your mind [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5080.0s)]
*  in your mind logically think about what it would take to get 11,779 people to fraudulently do that [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5085.04s)]
*  and that they would go to jail and it'd be a felony so this is that doesn't sound that hard to me I'm [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5093.360000000001s)]
*  just saying like how would you finding 11,000 votes or whatever doesn't seem that hard if there's [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5098.24s)]
*  no voter ID and ballot harvesting is allowed it's not possible where would you get 11,000 ballots [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5102.4s)]
*  maybe not in Georgia because they actually have voter integrity where would you get a [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5109.04s)]
*  11,000 ballots hold on a second California is a huge state they allow ballot harvesting and [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5112.719999999999s)]
*  they've eliminated voter ID yeah so how would you get 11,000 possible for someone to cheat [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5117.5199999999995s)]
*  nothing's impossible we all agree cheating exists like credit fraud fraud exists what I'm saying is [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5122.5599999999995s)]
*  it's so manageable that it is farcical for anybody to think that we could swing the presidential [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5128.96s)]
*  election because Trump tried to swing the presidential election by asking to find 11,000 [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5135.92s)]
*  and he filed 58 lawsuits and lost all of them it's not possible for you do you think so then [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5142.96s)]
*  what is the value then of having voter ID Jason if the cheating is so hard [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5148.32s)]
*  because it would add more trust to the system and it's always virtuous to add more trust I think [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5153.599999999999s)]
*  they should also give you a receipt when you vote to make sure there's no shenanigans and we want [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5157.84s)]
*  to build as much trust in the system as possible but the point here is see reduce fraud it would [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5163.36s)]
*  reduce people believing that their vote was changed after they left the box so if we all had a receipt [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5170.0s)]
*  and then there was some debate in a small area because of you know hanging chads like in Florida [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5176.96s)]
*  everybody would have their receipt and if you remember the hanging chads case there were people [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5183.2s)]
*  who said I voted for Gore I voted for Bush and my vote got counted wrong people don't remember this [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5186.72s)]
*  but you had to push through a card and it popped a chad out of a little circle and there are people [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5192.96s)]
*  who did it wrong because the instructions were you know it's a physical thing you have to punch a [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5198.16s)]
*  hole into it I don't know who came up with that system as opposed to drawing a circle but that [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5203.6s)]
*  that was years ago I'm sure that's true there was a guy named Chad yeah but no now they are giving [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5207.200000000001s)]
*  receipts to people so the gold standard is giving a receipt showing ID and having multiple weeks to [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5213.360000000001s)]
*  do it and so if anybody's taking anything away from this there can be cheating but it cannot [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5219.280000000001s)]
*  swing the presidential okay so Jason's going in can I make a point so you mentioned I think fraud [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5224.64s)]
*  rates credit card fraud rates didn't you I think that's one of the things you mentioned well [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5230.88s)]
*  the same way we don't worry about credit card fraud because there's a certain tiny amount of [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5234.96s)]
*  it in the system now in this case it would be a magnitude more than voter fraud voter fraud is [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5240.8s)]
*  extremely rare because there's no there's no incentive to cheat that would be worth going [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2E8Of78Vs&t=5246.8s)]
