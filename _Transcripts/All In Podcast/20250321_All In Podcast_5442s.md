# White House BTS, Google buys Wiz, Treasury vs Fed, Space Rescue
**All In Podcast:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU)
*  Freeberg had this great story. There's a machine there. I've never seen this machine in my life, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=0.0s)]
*  but he knew the machine. There's a Coca-Cola freestyle machine. There's a machine that's [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4.24s)]
*  right by the Navy mess where we had lunch in the situation room, which dispenses literally, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=9.68s)]
*  I've never seen this before. This is how out of touch you are. This is in every 7-Eleven. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=14.64s)]
*  90 different movies. Every McDonald's. Every movie theater. It's everywhere. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=19.92s)]
*  This is everywhere. You have not left. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=25.2s)]
*  I was blown away by this machine. All the Coca-Colas, all the Gatorades. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=28.08s)]
*  Timo, let me ask you a question. How much is a dozen eggs? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=32.32s)]
*  $399. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=38.48s)]
*  How much? Yeah, $399. He got it. $399. That's right. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=38.96s)]
*  No, $3.99. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=43.2s)]
*  Close. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=45.92s)]
*  $3.99. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=46.32s)]
*  It depends. It's pretty much double that in the Bay Area or Whole Foods, but yeah, half that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=47.12s)]
*  Ask me how much milk is. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=50.8s)]
*  How much is milk? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=52.4s)]
*  $8.99 to $11.99, depending on what you buy. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=54.0s)]
*  How much is a sweater, Timo? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=56.8s)]
*  My sweater is $4,000. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=58.8s)]
*  All right, everybody. Welcome back to the number one podcast in the world, the All-In Podcast, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=80.4s)]
*  with me again, Chamath Palihapitiya, David Friedberg, and look at this. Look at this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=86.48s)]
*  Live from DC, our bestie, David Sachs is back. He's suited up in the administration and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=93.68s)]
*  in the fifth bestie seat for the second time. My long-term bestie, Sian Bannister, hot on the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=100.72s)]
*  trails of her new fun-to-getting announcement. Congratulations on that, Sian. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=107.68s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. Excited to be back. I'm so excited. I did not expect to see David. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=111.28s)]
*  I'm over the moon. I'm so excited. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  Well, I just popped into reminisce about this trip that Chamath and Friedberg just did. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=120.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  A trip of a lifetime. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=128.0s)]
*  Trip of a lifetime. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=129.44s)]
*  Man, all the besties of the White House. It was really incredible. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=132.16s)]
*  Oh, wait. Jake, that wasn't there? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=132.56s)]
*  Actually, it's interesting to say that. It's interesting. I checked my spam filters and I [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=135.2s)]
*  got stuck in the spam filters. I had ski week this week, so I wouldn't have been able to make [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=141.12s)]
*  it anyway. I noticed there were some other invites stuck in my ... A couple of other invites got [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=148.32s)]
*  stuck. My Jeopardy invite, I see that you guys are all going to be in the next Jeopardy in the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=154.96s)]
*  second round. My invite to Jeopardy somehow got lost. I talked to John, the CEO, so that was a [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  bummer. Also, I missed my invite to the Bridgerton. You got a cameo in Bridgerton there, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=166.48s)]
*  I see, Friedberg? I'm not going to be on the Netflix show Bridgerton. I missed that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  I think we're in a bit. Let's keep going, Jake. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  Looks like my White Party invite here with Diddy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=184.64s)]
*  Oh, well, we just got it in post. Oh, God, we got the White Party. Oh, look, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=187.76s)]
*  Ed Steen's Island. Oh, no, I'm sorry. That was Reid Hoffman's invite. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=191.83999999999997s)]
*  What was you? Sorry, I peeped that out of you, bro. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=195.04s)]
*  Hell yeah. I missed my invite. Keep going. You're on a roll here. Keep going. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=197.04s)]
*  All right, all right. Let's get back to it. Let's get back to it. It was a triumphant week for our [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=203.2s)]
*  best. There were little school girls giggling on the group chat. Oh, my God, I'm in the White House. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=206.64s)]
*  Oh, my God, look, I'm getting closer to power. What was it like, Chamath? Your dream has come [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=212.88s)]
*  true. You came here to America from Canada. You built all this from nothing and you wound up at [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=218.48s)]
*  the White House. Give it to me. It was probably the most intense three days that we had. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  Nat and I were there to see the president, but obviously we were there to see Sachs as well. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  But there was a bunch of other things that happened. Myself, Freeberg, New Money Sonny was there. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=238.16s)]
*  Our bestie, Elon Musk, obviously we dropped in with him. So to recap, on Sunday we got in, it was [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=243.76s)]
*  just like raining cats and dogs, nothing to say there. Then on Monday what happened was we [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=251.04s)]
*  basically had some meetings in the morning and then David said, guys, let me just [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=256.0s)]
*  walk you around and just show you where I work. By the way, we camped out in Sachs's office [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  for three days, which was awesome. So we had the passes to be at the West Wing and in the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=265.2s)]
*  Eisenhower building. That's Sachs's office. And so we all kind of worked from there. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=271.68s)]
*  And then we went and did our meetings from Sachs's office and Sachs's incredible chief of staff, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=276.32s)]
*  Tracy, escorted us around anytime we needed to go anywhere. So then we started to walk through the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=281.36s)]
*  West Wing. We dropped by. Look at Sachs's office for a second. I love what you've done with the place. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=287.04s)]
*  Were you allowed to put up a piece of art? And look at that desktop rig. I think the most iconic [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=292.48s)]
*  part of the West Wing is the portico where you see that those very famous shots of all these [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=298.4s)]
*  very important people. In this case, it's just the four of us, but you can see Nick, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=304.0s)]
*  there's the shot of all of us. Well, the portico connects the West Wing to the president's residence. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=309.28s)]
*  Tracy Sachs's chief of staff escorted us from the West Wing after we did an amazing tour of the West [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=314.56s)]
*  Wing over to the residence. I don't know if we were really supposed to do it, but she has full [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=319.91999999999996s)]
*  access. So we were able to kind of go on the walk. And then we took a walk around the residence [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=324.8s)]
*  and saw all the rooms, but this is the entrance to the West Wing right here. So when you come in for [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=329.6s)]
*  meetings, administrators, so we walk in, Pam Bondi is on our way out. We got to meet Pam Bondi. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, it really is amazing. Like members of the cabinet are coming in and out of this door. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=339.12s)]
*  Members that work in the West Wing are coming in or leaders. Yeah. And then we saw like leaders [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=343.2s)]
*  coming in. One of the most iconic things we were allowed to do was see the press room, by the way, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  the people that work and we'll get to it in a second because we met some incredible people [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=352.48s)]
*  that work in the White House. But some of the folks that don't necessarily get a lot of flowers, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=356.24s)]
*  like folks that work in like the upper press room and the lower press room, some of the kindest [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=360.88s)]
*  people and what they did was they're like, Oh guys, why don't you come and see where they do the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  presidential briefings. And the one thing about the White House is everything is just like in a nook [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=370.32s)]
*  and cranny away. So this is where obviously you see the presidential seal isn't there because the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=375.36s)]
*  president is not there, but we were able to do that. We met some really incredible- [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=379.6s)]
*  So you're in the press room here? This is the actual press room? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=383.36s)]
*  This is where- By the way, it was just like a little door. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  It's so small. It's a little door off the side. The whole West Wing is like disarmingly small. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=388.56s)]
*  You can walk for 15 seconds between the Oval Office and pretty much everywhere else in the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=394.40000000000003s)]
*  West Wing. It really is a very tight and Elon's got an office in there that we got to kind of [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=399.12s)]
*  drop in and say, hi. The president, obviously Chamath went over to the Oval. Then there's the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=403.52000000000004s)]
*  situation room. I mean, everything is within a couple of steps of everything. And it really is, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=408.56s)]
*  you're in these kind of historic moments as you walk through this, you just feel the resonance [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=414.96s)]
*  of everything that you've heard about and seen and all the history and legacy to everything. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=419.92s)]
*  And it's just all right there compact in one space. You're just overwhelmed. It really was [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=424.64s)]
*  overwhelming for me emotionally. It was overwhelming intellectually. You just kind of walk around and [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=430.16s)]
*  you're a part of it. I was telling Chamath, it was so emotional for me at the end of the day [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  to just be like, man, you come to this country, you come to America, from wherever you came from, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=441.52s)]
*  and anyone can find their way into this historic space. That's the beauty of this country. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=448.56s)]
*  It never really hit me until we were in this moment. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=455.12s)]
*  Let me show you- That I kind of really got it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=457.84s)]
*  You made some really incredible people. Nick, you can find a picture of myself and Freberg [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=460.32000000000005s)]
*  and Sonny and Sachs. We're with Taylor Budowich. David, he's a deputy chief of staff, right? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=464.64000000000004s)]
*  He's a deputy chief of staff for communications in the White House. His office is well-placed [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=471.44s)]
*  because through that window behind us is the gaggle. There's this lawn out on the White House [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=475.76000000000005s)]
*  called Pebble Beach and all the networks have tents there. And they'll do recordings with [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=482.88s)]
*  White House officials and the White House will be in the background. It's not like a green screen [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=486.96s)]
*  or an LED. It's the actual White House will be in the background. That's why it's all set up there [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=491.28s)]
*  and it's called Pebble Beach. And then there's an area, I think they call it like the sticks, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=495.2s)]
*  which is basically just like a paved area where White House officials can go out there and they [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=499.59999999999997s)]
*  get swarmed by all the media asking them questions. That's called the gaggle. So he can keep an eye on [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=504.32s)]
*  everything that's happening with the media through that window in his office. Is that where Marine [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=509.44s)]
*  One lands and you see everybody yelling at the president and trying to talk over the copters? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=514.8s)]
*  Or that's on the other side? That's on the other side. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=518.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's on the other side. But a lot of those reporters will just move over there when they have [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=520.4799999999999s)]
*  the option to do that. But when you see Caroline Levitt who's the White House press secretary or [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=524.4799999999999s)]
*  Stephen Miller is the deputy chief of staff for policy, they'll come out and all of a sudden [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=528.7199999999999s)]
*  they're speaking in a microphone. It'll seem impromptu. There'll be a lot of reporters. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=532.56s)]
*  That's usually the sticks and that's the White House gaggle. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=536.4799999999999s)]
*  We saw Elon, obviously. Nick, you can just show the picture of all of us with Elon. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=540.16s)]
*  The incredible thing is here you have the most incredible entrepreneur of our lifetime [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=544.1600000000001s)]
*  dealing with so many complicated issues. I'll tell you Elon works in one of the smallest offices [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=553.0400000000001s)]
*  I've ever seen. All he has is a desk with an enormous screen and his phone. You can see that [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=559.0400000000001s)]
*  there is nothing that matters except the task at hand and that's really inspiring. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=566.72s)]
*  Like it just puts everybody on the same level. You feel this energy that all of these guys are [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=572.0s)]
*  doing incredible work on behalf of the country, 201, where there's no ego about some of these [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=577.6s)]
*  things, meaning what is the office size? What is this? What is that? They're just here to grind. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=582.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't think I've ever seen a workforce more happy. You get there and the energy and the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=588.1600000000001s)]
*  intensity, it's very much like the TV show West Wing. There's just this constant momentum. Every [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=593.5200000000001s)]
*  day you live a whole lifetime and everyone is just energized. I was talking to Sax's chief of [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=599.04s)]
*  staff and she's like, you just never calm down. There's never a dull moment here and that's why [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=607.36s)]
*  everyone has this grin on their face. They're just so happy to be doing this work. It's just [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=614.7199999999999s)]
*  intense and incredible. The intensity I'm going to describe to you is a 45 minute or so [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=618.7199999999999s)]
*  experience in the Oval. The next day, myself and Nat and Sax go to see POTUS in the Oval. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=624.48s)]
*  There's this incredible meeting room and you wait there, the waiting room. It's quite large, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=636.32s)]
*  it's very beautiful, beautiful sofas, etc. Then they say, the president is ready to see you. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=643.6s)]
*  They say, the president is ready to see you. You get escorted into the Oval. The one thing that [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=652.0s)]
*  struck me about the Oval is it's also much smaller than what you would think. It's a very good size [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=658.24s)]
*  and it's a very natural size, but it's beautiful and it's inspiring. Our experience was Nat was in [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=663.28s)]
*  the front, I'm in the middle and then David's beside me. As we were walking through, you could [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=670.8s)]
*  hear that there was this very important conversation happening between [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=676.96s)]
*  and somebody else who I won't say about something that I won't say. But [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=681.12s)]
*  this was really important. We walk through the Oval and we walk through the back and we go into [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=684.64s)]
*  his private dining room. That has all this incredible memorabilia sticking around, Nick. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=689.36s)]
*  Maybe you can show the picture of me, Nat and the president. We had this conversation and in the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=695.0400000000001s)]
*  middle of the conversation, we had a chance to watch some Fox News together because the [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=700.32s)]
*  Dragon Capsule was landing. I texted Elon, I said, hey, we're in the Oval, do you want to come [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=705.6s)]
*  drop in? He texted back, can't Dragon Capsule landing? I'm like, yeah, I know, we're watching [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=710.32s)]
*  it right now. Nat, myself, POTUS, Saks were watching this thing unfold. Anyways, then we [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=714.4s)]
*  have our meeting, it ends. We walk out into this area where Taylor's office is, where that picture [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=723.28s)]
*  was, and we continue to just randomly sit there watching. And this is what you mean, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=731.2800000000001s)]
*  Freiburg. Marco Rubio comes by and so now we're just standing around. There's Marco Rubio, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=736.32s)]
*  we're talking about the landing. And then out of the left-hand side, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=741.76s)]
*  Sheikh Tanoon comes in because he's there to say hi to the president. Then he comes in, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=748.32s)]
*  obviously says hi to Marco Rubio, says hi to me. We talked for a few minutes. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=753.2s)]
*  He leaves. So the intensity of the people, just within two steps of each other, you saw the CIA [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=756.5600000000001s)]
*  director walk in and out. It's just an incredibly mesmerizing place where irrespective, I think, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=763.2s)]
*  of your political ideology, the minute that you're there, I think it's hard to not be anything but [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=770.88s)]
*  Team America. I think it's impossible, actually. And it's really inspiring. And by the way, coming [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=776.0s)]
*  home, I feel like I'm crashing, meaning there's such a level of adrenaline and dopamine. And we [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=783.44s)]
*  are like these observers. So I can only imagine, Sax, what it feels like for you when you're not [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=790.8800000000001s)]
*  in that environment. It's a really intoxicating, mesmerizing place. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=796.32s)]
*  Soterios Johnson I think that's well said, Jamoth. And every day there's something new. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=801.36s)]
*  Every day you discover something new. One day it's the Navy mess where, you didn't mention that, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=804.8800000000001s)]
*  but we got a chance to eat lunch. Yeah, we had lunch there. It was incredible. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=810.64s)]
*  Did you get a photo of the burgers? I did. I sent Nick a photo of the burger. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=815.92s)]
*  I got the veggie burger. The burger's famous, right? It's got the seal on the top. Yeah, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=819.76s)]
*  it's got the seal. They must use some sort of grill tool to [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=823.04s)]
*  burn the seal of the president of the United States onto the burgers. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=827.1999999999999s)]
*  By the way, you want to know something? They didn't do it on the veggie burger. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=832.3199999999999s)]
*  What does that say? They're sending you a message. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=835.84s)]
*  By the way, what's incredible about the narrowness and the smallness, there's just a door that does [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=840.64s)]
*  not look all that assuming. It's very unassuming. And there's just a small sign that says, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=845.84s)]
*  situation room. That's right next to the mess. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=851.04s)]
*  There's a little corridor off of the West Wing lobby, which by the way, like you said, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=854.48s)]
*  if you're hanging out in the West Wing lobby, you're going to run into all sorts of interesting [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=859.92s)]
*  people. But you go down this little passageway, it's so small. The header of the door is so small [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=862.88s)]
*  that Sriram, you know, does AI policy. He's 6'6". He almost concussed himself once because he hit [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=868.08s)]
*  his head at the top of the door. I think the door frame is about 6'2", is the clearance. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=874.24s)]
*  Maybe. Well, it was made over 100 years ago. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=878.72s)]
*  He literally has to duck his head every time he walks by. But in any event, if you walk to the end [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=881.5200000000001s)]
*  of that passageway, there's a little kiosk to get a coffee or you turn the other way and you're in [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=886.32s)]
*  the situation room. I mean, it's really- You could be whacking a terrorist from 4,000 [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=891.36s)]
*  miles away or you can get a mocha. You could do both. Why choose? Sian, you have a question. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=897.28s)]
*  What do you think? Are you taking all this in? Yeah, I want to know from David what his favorite [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=902.48s)]
*  piece of art is there and whether or not David and Chamath saw the Declaration of Independence. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=907.36s)]
*  Yeah, actually. Yeah. Well, go ahead, Chamath. Yeah, we saw it. I mean, so this is the problem, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=913.52s)]
*  Sian. I feel like I want to redo that moment. I mean, David gets to do it every day, but [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=918.72s)]
*  I want to redo it 50 times because we didn't necessarily stop there. He has to open and close [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=924.8s)]
*  the curtains because they want to keep the sun off the Declaration of Independence. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=929.5999999999999s)]
*  Probably a good idea. I didn't think to like, oh, sir, can we just stop? It's just such a [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=933.52s)]
*  whirlwind that I want to redo. I think you'll get a chance to. I think you will. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=937.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, when I run and I'm president, because I'm the only one here who can, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=945.04s)]
*  I will definitely- Sian can, can't you? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=948.4s)]
*  Sian can. Oh, wait, Sian, you're in America. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=950.64s)]
*  Yeah. Way to dial up the misogyny. Good for you. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=952.72s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I was talking about the besties here. I forgot for a second. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=956.32s)]
*  She's the bestie. All right. Listen, amazing. I was [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=959.52s)]
*  wondering about the choice of the double-breasted Chamath. This is a strong, strong choice here to [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=961.52s)]
*  go double-breasted to the White House. Take me through the thinking. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=966.1600000000001s)]
*  So first of all, big shout out to Luca Rubidace, my tailor. I did double-breasted on Monday [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=969.52s)]
*  and Wednesday. Whoa. Two in this one. So you quadded it in one week? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=975.44s)]
*  But then I went single-breasted to see Pogus. Okay. I did notice that. Yeah. It's a little [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=980.8s)]
*  gratuitous to go triple-double. You don't want to triple-double. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=984.88s)]
*  By the way, so we're hanging out in the White House and we got the random, it was like one [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=987.76s)]
*  o'clock in the afternoon, Chamath, on Monday when they said, hey, would you guys like to sit down [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=992.24s)]
*  with Secretary of the Treasury, Scott Besson? And so then we- [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=997.1999999999999s)]
*  Special bonus episode. They're like at 5.30 today. We had a dinner at 7, 7.30. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1000.64s)]
*  So it was pretty tight, but we were like, yes, that sounds good. So then we got to go over to [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1005.52s)]
*  Treasury later in the afternoon. We had a camera guy come and set up. So yeah, here's this, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1010.48s)]
*  this beautiful room in Treasury. I forgot the name of the room. Do you remember? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1015.92s)]
*  Yes. It was like the something chase room. We got to find this beautiful room. So we set up [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1020.16s)]
*  the interviews on YouTube, obviously on X. And on the main feed. It's on the main [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1025.92s)]
*  feed. And then we got a call after we did the Besson interview. And, you know, I think folks [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1030.72s)]
*  that were there from press said that that was great. Howard Lutnick, who Chamath was going to [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1037.6s)]
*  be doing a meeting with on Wednesday morning, right before we were flying home, said, what if [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1043.6s)]
*  I come in early before our meeting, Chamath? And we do a sit down. So we said, great, let's do it. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1047.6s)]
*  So then we got to go to the White House press auditorium. They have a special auditorium just [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1052.48s)]
*  outside the West Wing. And you guys will recognize the stage, obviously, for many Biden [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1057.76s)]
*  press interviews. Here's the stage. And so then we did this interview with Lutnick and my God, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1062.08s)]
*  this is going to be a barn burner of an interview when it comes out. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1067.84s)]
*  I ran into him after he had done this interview and he was, he was excited about it. Sounds like [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1070.32s)]
*  you guys were on fire. He was on fire, Sacks. I mean, this guy, I think it's going to, there's [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1074.72s)]
*  going to be so many clips out of this interview. It was incredible. It was like over an hour and a [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1079.2s)]
*  half. And he just kept going and going. He, yeah. After there afterwards, we went to his building, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1082.72s)]
*  by the way, you know that he's the secretary of commerce. Howard's office is the war department [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1087.44s)]
*  office, the old war department office. So we jumped in his car and we went to his office. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1091.3600000000001s)]
*  It is the most beautiful. I, this is again, I didn't think to stop and take photos. I should [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1096.4s)]
*  have taken more photos, but his office is outrageously beautiful. Sacks, I don't know [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1101.8400000000001s)]
*  if you've been over there. Yeah, I have. Yeah. I had a meeting over there. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1107.2s)]
*  Let me just say one thing. I want to say that politics and policy aside, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1111.04s)]
*  these individuals from the White House deputy chief of staff to these members of the cabinet, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1116.3200000000002s)]
*  to all the staff that work in the West Wing were incredibly open and transparent. There were no [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1122.4s)]
*  press people intervening or involved. It was very random, very ad hoc that we got to have these sit [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1126.72s)]
*  down conversations and they were just so open. And I just want to say like that was really [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1131.68s)]
*  refreshing and really incredible. And I feel really privileged to have had the opportunity [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1135.6000000000001s)]
*  to kind of sit through this, but you know, I was not expecting this on this trip at all. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1139.6000000000001s)]
*  I think that when you work in the White House and you have been successful in the private sector, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1144.16s)]
*  like Scott Besson or Howard Ludnick or myself. Or Doug Burgum or Elon. Or Elon especially. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1149.2s)]
*  I would describe it as a money for purpose trade. You're giving up money, but the sense of purpose [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1156.48s)]
*  you feel working for the White House, for this president is just incredible. And I think you [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1161.92s)]
*  guys kind of picked up on that. And in my view, that's a trade that you should be happy to make [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1166.0800000000002s)]
*  any day of the week because it is really an honor to work at the White House. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1171.6s)]
*  And for this president, because he actually wants to get things done on behalf of the American [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1175.84s)]
*  people. The default state of Washington is just that nothing gets done. Right? You guys know that. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1179.4399999999998s)]
*  The bureaucracy and the entropy and the inertia just basically rule the day. And so it takes [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1184.8799999999999s)]
*  a president who number one has a mandate from the American people. Number two has a tremendous [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1191.9199999999998s)]
*  sense of mission and purpose. Number three brings tremendous energy to the job. And then I think [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1196.56s)]
*  finally assembles the right team around him. And those are the conditions under which you can [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1200.88s)]
*  actually make change, positive change for the country. And we have that. And it's kind of a [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1204.72s)]
*  once in a lifetime opportunity. If we don't get this done now, if we're not able to cut the deficit [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1209.0400000000002s)]
*  and debt now, when are we ever going to do it? This is the once in a lifetime opportunity. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1214.88s)]
*  And I think everybody there feels that. I think everyone in the White House is really proud to [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1220.72s)]
*  be there and excited to be there. And it's fun. And part of it is that you can [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1225.5200000000002s)]
*  tell that the president, he makes this job fun because he's having a great time. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1230.8s)]
*  He was really, I think, born to do this job. I mean, in so many ways, he just brings so much [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1237.04s)]
*  energy to it. He's indefatigable. There's so many- He's empowering. Like everyone we met with, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1241.44s)]
*  Sachs, to your point, they've all been successful in another part of life, in business and whatnot, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1247.36s)]
*  and they're generally post-economic people. But he's letting everyone run. We got to meet with [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1252.56s)]
*  several other members of the cabinet and they were all sharing with us that they're being given [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1257.68s)]
*  autonomy and authority. They can just run. And I think that that's really important. If you want [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1262.4s)]
*  to bring in high impact people, you need to let them have an impact and let them do their thing. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1266.88s)]
*  I observe that repeatedly. Can I give you one quick anecdote, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1270.4s)]
*  maybe to wrap this segment up? So when we're sitting in, when we're at the private dining room, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1273.1200000000001s)]
*  Steve Witkoff, who's another incredible entrepreneur, was dealing with something [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1278.5600000000002s)]
*  sensitive, comes in, tells the president. He's like, okay, great, great job. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1283.12s)]
*  Then there was three other issues. Sachs had something, then Sergio had something. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1287.9199999999998s)]
*  And then on top of all of that, so there's this bang, bang, bang. And then he's also like, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1292.56s)]
*  guys, listen, for this dinner coming up, I really want to make sure the acoustics is right so [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1296.8s)]
*  everybody has an opportunity. It's like the level of detail from the most important thing all the [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1301.1999999999998s)]
*  way down to literally the acoustics in the dining room, he is on top of all of it. And I was just [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1306.32s)]
*  like, and that was again, just in my small little brief observation. And I was like, this is crazy. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1311.28s)]
*  To your point, like the energy and the, the indefatigability and the desire to get every [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1317.04s)]
*  little thing right. It's pretty rare. I kind of feel like America's in good hands, to be honest. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1323.36s)]
*  Pete Slauson You saw it just in those few minutes when he's being peppered with so many decisions, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1328.8s)]
*  so many actions. You just realize what a demanding job it is. And you really need [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1333.04s)]
*  a person who just is special in that way that they're just somehow cut out for that type of [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1338.64s)]
*  job. It is very difficult. Michael O'Brien [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1344.3200000000002s)]
*  Totally agree. I think Freeberg is totally right. If we can create a pattern where [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1346.4s)]
*  people with high executive, let's just say that because that's less of a loaded word than businessman [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1351.2s)]
*  or successful, whatever. People with high executive function that have proven it [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1355.68s)]
*  should at some point in their career, step into government and replace money for purpose. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1361.1200000000001s)]
*  If that is a trend that this administration creates, I think America is in credible hands. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1367.52s)]
*  Pete Slauson Which will be how the founding fathers [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1371.68s)]
*  operated the government originally. Michael O'Brien [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1374.8s)]
*  There'll be a moment guys where the Democrats win, right? There'll be a moment when the Republicans [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1376.48s)]
*  return to power. There'll be a moment when all the ideologies flip. But if in all of that, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1382.08s)]
*  you can find people who are willing to pause their private lives, have demonstrated executive [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1386.96s)]
*  function and can make the trade, we're going to just kick ass. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1392.16s)]
*  And give back. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1395.0400000000002s)]
*  It's great. David, thank you. I really honestly thank you. You are awesome. You're awesome. Thank [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1397.2800000000002s)]
*  you for giving us a window into that. David Tenenbaum [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1404.0s)]
*  Shout out to Tracy as well, who's incredible. She's incredible. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1406.5600000000002s)]
*  Pete Slauson J. Cal, what do you think of the [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1412.0800000000002s)]
*  Besson interview? Did you see it? J. Cal I did watch the Besson one. Yeah, I mean, listen, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1413.1200000000001s)]
*  I would have loved to ask him a couple of questions. Obviously, I would have probably done a couple of [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1418.16s)]
*  fastballs, curve balls, would have gone a little bit harder. But he's so impressive. And you guys [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1421.68s)]
*  did like an hour with him. And I haven't heard what did we miss that you would have asked? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1426.8s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you know, you got to get a little bit into the chaos. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1431.28s)]
*  I think it's a good time for me to drop off. Yeah, I'll drop off. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1435.44s)]
*  Okay. We'll see you later. You can tell everyone now what a great job you would have done. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1443.04s)]
*  Love you, Zach. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1448.24s)]
*  See you in the commissary. What a guy. No, I thought it was really good to hear from him long [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1452.4s)]
*  form. I think there's a little bit of chaos going on with the terrorists and stuff like that. But [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1458.5600000000002s)]
*  you know, I don't think the country knows how great he is. This guy is a powerhouse. He has an [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1462.3200000000002s)]
*  incredible track record. And by the way, like Trump picking him, I'm going to give Trump a little bit [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1467.68s)]
*  of flowers here. Obviously, folks know I'm an independent and an ever Trump-er who is, you know, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1472.8s)]
*  supporting the administration to do the best they can. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1476.48s)]
*  What does it mean to be independent but also have another label that says you refuse to consider [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1478.48s)]
*  somebody? I don't understand. I mean, I had my own issues with what Trump did on January 6th. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1482.96s)]
*  We don't need to get into it. Overturning Roe v. Wade, we don't have to get into the things that [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1489.76s)]
*  I don't agree with what he did. Putting all those things aside, I think he's done a great job with [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1492.8s)]
*  the team he's putting here. And this is, you know, my message to I think some of the Americans or [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1498.72s)]
*  the people on the left is I would look at what he's doing. And some of these individuals, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1502.6399999999999s)]
*  these are really high functioning individuals. The last time I think he had a cast of characters [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1507.04s)]
*  around him, who I think were kind of dark, and I didn't care for a lot of them with best. And [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1511.44s)]
*  this guy is like a bye. I think he was previously a Democrat who gave to a ton of Democrats. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1517.04s)]
*  And he is a powerhouse. And I think he really understands financial. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1522.8799999999999s)]
*  Ludwig was a big donor to Hillary. And then R.F.K. was a Democrat. Tulsi was a Democrat. Trump was a [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1526.8s)]
*  Democrat. I mean, you know, this is my point. I was a Democrat. You were a Democrat. Yeah. So [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1533.36s)]
*  I think that's, you know, Besant is I came away from it saying this guy's super qualified. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1538.7199999999998s)]
*  And the chaos that I think Trump has been creating with like back and forth with the tariffs and his [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1545.52s)]
*  communication style, it made me feel better to know that there was somebody who is rock solid [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1550.32s)]
*  like him in there. And who's really thoughtful. Because right now, when you talk to 50 people who [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1555.6s)]
*  are knowledgeable about the markets and say, What is the strategy here that Trump has, you get [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1561.28s)]
*  10 different answers, five different vectors for it, people are trying to figure out exactly what [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1566.8s)]
*  he's trying to do. And there's a lot of non consensus. But hearing that he's got somebody [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1571.12s)]
*  like him there, and you talking to him for an hour, I felt much better about the situation. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1576.96s)]
*  And that maybe there is a plan here. I think it was a it was a solid interview. Yeah, absolutely. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1581.2s)]
*  And I mean, the access level, you know, most of the time, he's on something like meet the press, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1586.8s)]
*  or 11 minutes, the nation, and it's 11 minutes. And the guy can't breathe. Totally. For him to [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1592.32s)]
*  go an hour and you kind of you did a good job, Chamath, of sort of giving his history with which [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1597.84s)]
*  I think the context most Americans don't have. So I was very proud of the job. The two of you did. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1602.8799999999999s)]
*  I wish I was there. I'm also a great job, by the way, because Chamath T that he had a very incredible [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1607.6s)]
*  job. By the way, I got to give you flowers for having good intuition on some of the questions [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1611.76s)]
*  you asked both Lutnick and Besant that I think revealed a little bit more about their character [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1616.48s)]
*  and who they are as people, which I was not on. I'm all about like, what are the hard, what are [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1621.1200000000001s)]
*  the questions I want to ask related to policy and agenda. But you did a great job bringing that out [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1625.2s)]
*  in them. And that actually, I think, created a lot of texture for both interviews that I was not, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1630.0s)]
*  I was not thinking about. So great job. I'm looking forward to the next one. I know when [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1634.72s)]
*  that drops, but that should be really good. Oh my God, dude, the Lutnick interview. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1637.6s)]
*  He's a hardcore New Yorker and like he really, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1645.84s)]
*  I just talked to him about tariffs. Let me tell you, yeah, we did talk about [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1649.84s)]
*  tariffs. The thing you need to know about Howard Lutnick is he is an incredibly resilient [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1652.8799999999999s)]
*  and resourceful businessman. This guy has built himself up literally from nothing. Good human. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1659.4399999999998s)]
*  I'm a little biased, but he's a great guy. And you're going to hear some really incredible [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1665.84s)]
*  stories. But again, another one who traded money for purpose. Look, I just want to say real quick, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1671.28s)]
*  we don't do ads on the show, but we did have three sponsors that actually helped fund our DC trip and [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1677.6s)]
*  set this thing up for us. So I really want to say thank you to him's him's.com and for hers, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1682.8s)]
*  Gemini and I trust everyone listening to the show, please go to the description, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1687.76s)]
*  whatever player you're in, check them out. These three sponsors helped make this trip happen. We're [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1691.84s)]
*  really appreciative. Please take a look at their websites, give their products a shot. Thank you [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1697.04s)]
*  to him's Gemini and I trust you guys are the best. We really appreciate it. All right, everybody. We [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1701.6799999999998s)]
*  got a full docket today. Lots of docket and you know, just, hey, welcome back to the show. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1706.8s)]
*  Sian, I just wanted to start. You had a really great announcement this week. Long Journey Ventures, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1712.3999999999999s)]
*  your venture capital firm announced 180 million dollar fund. Tell us a little bit about that. Well, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1718.48s)]
*  181, 181, 181 and 18. 18 stands for life to people who are Jewish and my partners are Jewish. And it [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1723.04s)]
*  was something that was very important to them and to me to stand up after October 7th and, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1736.96s)]
*  you know, take a very public stance. And so we announced our funding announcement on Bloomberg [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1744.08s)]
*  yesterday and, and our office is on 18th street. So congrats. Yeah, that's awesome. What is the [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1749.04s)]
*  mission of the venture fund? What stage are you going to do? You and I started as angel investors [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1756.16s)]
*  together 14 years ago. So we focus on early stage seed checks, first check in. And you know, this, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1760.8799999999999s)]
*  this fund is our fourth fund, we institutionalized more. In the beginning, it was high net worth [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1767.84s)]
*  individuals. And then now we're, you know, going to kind of what Shamath was speaking about earlier is [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1773.9199999999998s)]
*  aligning what we do with our higher purpose. And so now we're helping, you know, institutions help [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1778.8s)]
*  people go to school, solving cancer, and things like that. So every day that we get up in the [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1785.4399999999998s)]
*  morning, you know, we're aligning what we do. Our mission is to chase the magically weird, we're [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1789.76s)]
*  looking for alpha in things when everybody is consensus investing, and they're doing the same [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1795.36s)]
*  thing and talking about the same things, we're thinking six to eight years in the future. You [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1800.6399999999999s)]
*  know, when our fund three, we invested in a company in the chip space. And, you know, we were [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1805.12s)]
*  thinking ahead about what's going to power AI and crypto. And now that everybody's, you know, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1811.1999999999998s)]
*  investing in the application layer, we're going into the next thing, which is like, what is that [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1816.0s)]
*  going to enable? And what's coming down the road and looking for founders that are thinking [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1820.16s)]
*  differently that most other of my peers would look at and say, that's crazy, I don't want to [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1825.28s)]
*  put any money into that. So that's, that's what we focus on. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1829.1200000000001s)]
*  This is such a hard thing for people to get their heads around the non consensus bet and why that's [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1831.68s)]
*  so important. I'm, you know, I'm training, you know, new associates at our firm, and they always [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1837.2s)]
*  are going to safety. So they're looking at a vertical, they're looking at a startup and saying, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1842.16s)]
*  well, this makes the most sense. And then they look at the ones that don't make sense, but that [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1846.96s)]
*  are like intriguing. And they are like, Yeah, I don't know if I want to place a bet on that. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1851.92s)]
*  Because I'm saying I'm like, that's where the gold is, is that non consensus bet when you and [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1856.72s)]
*  I did Uber was a room of 21 people, three people decided to invest 19 didn't. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1861.92s)]
*  Yeah, that was a magically weird company at the time. If you remember, I sent it around to [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1866.88s)]
*  multiple investors, and they came back with the stupidest excuses I ever heard. But it was their [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1870.4s)]
*  excuse, which is, you know, not everyone wants a black car, the car doesn't come to my house yet. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1874.72s)]
*  No one wants to get into a stranger's vehicle. The list goes on and on. But it takes a vision [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1880.72s)]
*  of seeing the future and seeing how it plays out and believing in all the miracles that are going [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1886.96s)]
*  to happen. And getting in early is where all the alpha is, you know, before the thing is defined [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1890.56s)]
*  as a category. So that's where I like to play is I don't want it to even have a market name yet. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1895.84s)]
*  Such a great observation. Like when when an associate or some research company says, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1901.04s)]
*  oh, it's the on demand economy. That's when you know that opportunity. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1907.28s)]
*  You can let like all of my peers can go lose all their money in an ocean of dead bodies, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1912.08s)]
*  because I don't want to play there. Yeah. And you had a price advantage to right, like if you enter [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1917.28s)]
*  early, before it's a defined category, you're taking on a lot of risk. And so, you know, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1922.96s)]
*  I'm getting deals anywhere from like, five to 10 posts while all of my peers are playing in the 20 [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1927.68s)]
*  to 30 range. And so obviously, literally, you and I are the product of, you know, our early bets and [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1932.5600000000002s)]
*  like what the lessons we learned. And like one of those lessons was to be an early. It's literally [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1938.72s)]
*  what I'm doing founder university now is just trying to do 100. It's just like a pre accelerator. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1943.76s)]
*  If I find two or three founders who I like, I give them their first 25k check or 125k check where [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1949.76s)]
*  they can just come, you know, do it with me. We're starting next Friday. So people want to come [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1955.52s)]
*  founder dot university. But it's just like what we used to do in the old days, trying to get in, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1959.76s)]
*  congrats, be the first investor. And it's really working. And it's super fun. Hey, listen, there's [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1964.0s)]
*  great news, I think for the venture industry, this Google acquiring whiz. I think this is this could [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1970.0s)]
*  be the starter's pistol. Yeah, it's absolutely fantastic. Google has acquired whiz for 32 [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1976.48s)]
*  billion dollars in cash. If you don't know what whiz is, just imagine you have cloud services like [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1982.4s)]
*  Microsoft's Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google's cloud, Oracle's cloud, you need to have security [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1989.1200000000001s)]
*  between these things. They help do that. It's the largest deal in Google's history. David was there, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=1995.1200000000001s)]
*  I think for some of the other big acquisitions, there haven't been a lot of acquisitions. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2001.44s)]
*  Obviously, we know the wrath of Lena con was pretty acute for the last four years. But looking [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2007.6s)]
*  back in history, Salesforce buying slack, which our bestie Chamath here was an early investor in [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2013.76s)]
*  for 27 billion that occurred in 2020. And then we had a couple of things get blocked. HP and was a [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2019.76s)]
*  juniper, I believe for 14 billion last year got blocked. And so and Adobe Figma, Adobe Figma got [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2025.52s)]
*  blocked in the UK, blocked in the UK, but they, you know, assumed it was gonna happen here. And [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2032.3999999999999s)]
*  this is actually we talked about this on episode 189. Chamath whiz turned down 23 billion dollars [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2036.64s)]
*  from Google. They said at the time was because they wanted to IPO. But now reporting is saying, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2042.5600000000002s)]
*  it was because of the antitrust stuff under Biden plus the UK, obviously, go ahead, Chamath, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2048.2400000000002s)]
*  you can take it from there. I think this is the Trump premium. I mean, the problem when that deal [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2052.8s)]
*  was being looked at back then was there was still a chance that there could be a Democrat [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2057.52s)]
*  administration and it was very clear that they were anti M&A and anti tech, quite honestly. And [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2064.24s)]
*  when Trump won, I think it basically said, Okay, we can now look at these deals. There's another [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2072.64s)]
*  important part of this, though. And this is part of our interview with Howard Lutnick, I'd love to [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2078.9599999999996s)]
*  just play this quick clip. What I'm doing is I'm saying, Okay, I got to collect tariffs. Right? So [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2083.7599999999998s)]
*  I go to one of the great software companies of the earth. And I say, I want you to give me [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2089.2s)]
*  you're going to build for me for America, you're going to build the greatest [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2096.48s)]
*  customs processing ever. But what's incredible is you're convincing these companies to basically [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2100.0s)]
*  like do right for America and build a software for you. You think that's going to be a movement [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2106.3199999999997s)]
*  throughout the government? Or is that? Here's the idea. I say, build it for me for free. Yeah. I [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2109.8399999999997s)]
*  put it in for free. What other countries in the world you think gonna buy now? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2115.12s)]
*  Right. If it works for us. Well, remember, you have to you have to connect to me. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2121.12s)]
*  So every country, right? This is what is he really saying? What he's really saying is, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2125.92s)]
*  there are all kinds of companies that are doing all kinds of work, who Google famously has this [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2132.56s)]
*  20% time, could you imagine if some of this 20% time was allocated to rebuilding the core [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2138.4s)]
*  infrastructure of America, and giving back to the country that gives you the ability to have [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2144.0s)]
*  a multi trillion dollar company? That's about one example. So when you connect the dots, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2149.36s)]
*  the way that I interpret it, is that I think companies will be much more aggressive on M&A, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2154.16s)]
*  Jason, it's what you've been asking for. I think you're going to get it. And I think the reason [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2160.16s)]
*  why you're going to get it is you're going to have a very open minded administration that will let the [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2164.4s)]
*  M&A happen. But also, there are ways where you can build goodwill by doing the kinds of things that [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2168.0s)]
*  Howard is talking about. I mean, could you imagine if somebody volunteered, let's say, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2173.76s)]
*  Palantir and said, Hey, we can build the following software for the IRS so that we can just [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2178.1600000000003s)]
*  completely automate tax returns. And it's okay for Palantir, there's still a $200 billion company, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2182.96s)]
*  they could allocate a small amount of time and get that done if Oracle stepped up and said something. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2188.96s)]
*  So and all of that goodwill will then allow America to just grow faster. And then under that [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2193.28s)]
*  economic umbrella, a little consolidation is not necessarily a bad thing. So I'm really interested [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2199.68s)]
*  in how all of these pieces move together. That's, that's the one thing I get. But I'd like to say [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2206.48s)]
*  something else very narrowly about whiz, which is whiz does not do something that's necessarily [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2210.96s)]
*  unique, meaning there are other products in market. But they have done one thing better than [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2218.96s)]
*  everybody else. And I think it's really worth rewarding, which is they have incredible taste. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2225.12s)]
*  So if you use it, and all my engineers at 8090 live inside of this regime, when I ask them, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2230.7999999999997s)]
*  Hey, we need to implement something. They all picked whiz. And if you ask them why, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2239.8399999999997s)]
*  and if you ask our sysadmin, why did we implement it, not only is it good, but it is the most [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2244.7999999999997s)]
*  beautiful, it is the most intuitive, it's the most well integrated. And it's just an incredible [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2250.4s)]
*  lesson where even when other people do this other thing, you can build $32 billion of value by just [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2254.96s)]
*  doing that thing in a more coherent way. I mean, design matters, right? I think so. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2263.12s)]
*  Having taste and having taste matters. Having a perspective. It's so great that that was rewarded. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2267.76s)]
*  Cyan, what do you think of what I'll call Lutnick's lighthouse customer approach? In other words, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2273.36s)]
*  this piece of software for the US government will become your first customer, the lighthouse that [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2280.72s)]
*  pulls in other customers for free and for free. So we get it for free. We help you set the standard, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2286.0s)]
*  and then you get to use us as your reference client. Let's start with that thoughts on that. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2292.56s)]
*  And then we'll get into M&A. I think that the government has long relied on private industry [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2297.2799999999997s)]
*  to solve some of its biggest problems. And that's what sets us apart from other countries in the [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2302.56s)]
*  world. And so you look at some of the best companies like SpaceX, Andoril, etc. We need [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2306.8s)]
*  more companies like this if we're going to compete. And so doing this absolutely makes sense. And it's [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2315.1200000000003s)]
*  just going to help the sales cycle to get that sort of stamp of approval that our government [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2320.4s)]
*  is using that software. Freeberg, your thoughts on Lutnick's lighthouse strategy. Could it work? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2325.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think this is what makes it good to have, as we talked about earlier, folks with high [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2331.28s)]
*  executive function and business experience and acumen in key leadership positions in the [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2340.1600000000003s)]
*  government. So they know how to drive better economic outcomes, negotiating the price of a [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2346.0s)]
*  contract down and saying, in this case, give it to us for free. One of the things Lutnick said in [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2352.88s)]
*  the interview, which you didn't see in this clip, is that the government can actually accept four [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2358.32s)]
*  free contracts, these gratis contracts, and you don't need to go get approval to do it. So they [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2363.84s)]
*  can operate in the executive branch. Oh, that makes total sense, right? You don't need an approval [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2369.36s)]
*  if it's gratis. That makes total. That's right. Yeah, that makes it even more brilliant. That's [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2373.76s)]
*  also a big unlock. Yeah. Well, then I guess we can contrast this, Chamath, with Tim Waltz, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2378.48s)]
*  you know, VP, potential VP candidate. I have a real problem with this clip, Jason. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2384.0s)]
*  This was the most infuriating thing I've ever seen from a politician. I mean, Tim Waltz [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2390.08s)]
*  gets on stage, pulls out his stock app and starts mocking the greatest American car company ever [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2397.04s)]
*  created and that its stock is down. This is Disgraciad.com to me. Play the clip, Nick. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2404.64s)]
*  I know some of you know this on the iPhone. They've got that little stock app. I added [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2411.7599999999998s)]
*  Tesla to it to give me a little boost during the day. 225 and dropping. So [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2415.3599999999997s)]
*  and if you own one, if you own one, we're not blaming you. You can take dental floss and pull [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2427.68s)]
*  the Tesla thing off, you know, and take out- I mean, Chamath, you want to talk about this [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2433.68s)]
*  communist scumbag and what he did there? No, I'm not going to say anything personal except to say [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2437.6s)]
*  that I think that it is incredibly low brow. At the end of the day, he represents the American people. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2442.64s)]
*  He needs to be firmly on Team America. I don't think he understands this because he's never [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2452.88s)]
*  actually had a real job, but the auto industry is a vibrant part of how many, many, many Americans [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2458.08s)]
*  earn their living. Tesla employees, 125,000 plus employees. There is no reason a politician should [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2465.52s)]
*  be wishing any American company to fail, period. I just think that should be the price of entry. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2474.88s)]
*  And so to lack the basic decorum and understanding and then to whip people up into wanting any [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2479.92s)]
*  American company to fail. There are many American companies, sure, I like or dislike, whatever. It's [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2486.4s)]
*  not the point. There are some that I'll buy the stock of. There are some that I would not. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2492.48s)]
*  That's not the point. You cannot openly and actively be cheering, as a politician at least, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2496.56s)]
*  for these things to fail. That I think is just incredibly low brow. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2503.68s)]
*  I think it's the bottoming out of the Democratic party. That moment will be looked at as the bottom. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2507.44s)]
*  Cyan, any thoughts? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2511.76s)]
*  I think it's incredibly low brow. I agree with Chamath and I think it's just so distasteful [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2512.8s)]
*  for a public official to do something like that, especially for an American company. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2517.44s)]
*  If you hear the people cheering in the background, it's obvious that there's a base that supports [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2524.32s)]
*  this and that frightens me even more because he's saying these things because his constituents [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2527.76s)]
*  believe it. A politician says these things because they think it's going to motivate them [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2533.28s)]
*  to vote for them in the future and that really frightens me. That we are riling people up to [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2539.2s)]
*  cheer on the destruction of American company and possibly go out and burn cars. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2546.32s)]
*  You know, I think that's the outcome. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2550.8s)]
*  That's the real point, Cyan. Whenever you incite this kind of aggressiveness, and by the way, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2553.12s)]
*  both sides do it, you get a contingent who takes it too far, Freeberg. Maybe we wrap up on this [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2559.44s)]
*  and then we can jump back to Wiz. Sorry for the diversion. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2565.04s)]
*  I think the Democratic party has split into two parties. There's the Democratic party with [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2567.52s)]
*  beliefs and there's the Democratic party without beliefs. I think that the Democratic party with [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2573.92s)]
*  beliefs is the one that's very far left and their beliefs are fundamentally rooted in concepts of [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2579.36s)]
*  socialism, Marxism. And they're very clear about those beliefs that traditional power structures [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2584.96s)]
*  need to be dismantled and assets and influence need to be commonly redistributed. The rest of [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2590.96s)]
*  the Democratic party, which people call the moderate part of the party, actually don't really know [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2598.8s)]
*  what their beliefs are. When you talk to anyone in the Republican party in a leadership position, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2603.44s)]
*  you hear very clearly what their beliefs are. We saw it this week in DC. Every member of the [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2607.76s)]
*  cabinet that we met with, and there were quite a number of them, had the exact same message and the [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2612.4s)]
*  exact same set of beliefs of what this administration stands for and what they're trying to do. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2616.56s)]
*  You may agree with those beliefs or you may not, but they have stated their beliefs. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2620.64s)]
*  The problem is that because the moderates in the Democratic party have not stated a set of beliefs, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2624.88s)]
*  a set of objectives, a vision for the country, a vision for their party, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2629.84s)]
*  the party is effectively being represented by this part of the party that does have beliefs, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2634.0s)]
*  the deeply socialist Marxist beliefs. And they have basically subsumed the message. And as a [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2639.04s)]
*  result, this is why people have lost interest in the Democratic party because the moderate aspect [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2643.76s)]
*  has not been really clear on what their beliefs are. There is an opportunity for some of these [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2649.04s)]
*  moderate leaders in the Democratic party like Dean Phillips, like, and people may not like me [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2654.0s)]
*  saying this, but like Gavin Youssef, who I don't think is all the way over on that far left side [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2659.84s)]
*  of the spectrum, to be really clear and paint a better vision and really state the beliefs of [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2664.08s)]
*  the party and what the beliefs are that differentiate them. And those beliefs, recently, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2670.0s)]
*  the only thing that underscores what that party stands for is we're not the other guys, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2675.12s)]
*  we're not the Republicans. And that's it. And so people that don't like the Republicans are like, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2680.4s)]
*  well, I don't know, because then I'm subsumed by the socialist Marxist rhetoric. So I don't know [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2684.7200000000003s)]
*  if I want to be a part of that either. And that's why I think a lot of people feel left out. And [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2688.96s)]
*  that's why I think the recent polling data, if you pull it up on the Democrats, it's like 23% [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2691.84s)]
*  or something in this country now. It was like 30s or something. Did you see the crazy clip that did [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2697.36s)]
*  the racial demographic split on some key issues, like things like DEI? Is this the one that says [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2702.0s)]
*  white college age women are just like this weird? Anyway, I think Tim Waltz, like a lot of others, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2707.28s)]
*  because there's no other beliefs to stand for, you end up being subsumed by the part of the [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2713.44s)]
*  Democratic Party that does have beliefs. And you don't have anything else to say to state and to [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2716.88s)]
*  to show what you're for. And I think a lot of people- [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2721.44s)]
*  Here's an idea too. It's a really good framing. I really like that. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2723.92s)]
*  Well, and here's another framing. Is it so hard to agree on something? I think this is one of the [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2727.52s)]
*  brilliant things that Trump did was he's like, here are some things we can agree on. And he just [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2733.2s)]
*  subsumed those like fighting for the working class person saying no tax on tips. Like these were [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2737.52s)]
*  Democratic positions. I think this just proves that meme where it's like, standing here and [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2742.72s)]
*  and the left just went too far away. And they give you a everybody. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2748.24s)]
*  Yeah. Let me give you a piece of advice to the Democratic Party leadership that might be listening. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2751.6s)]
*  The advice I would give you is basically take away the opportunity for the distinction that [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2757.3599999999997s)]
*  the Republicans have right now, which is a more efficient government, a more fair government where [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2763.04s)]
*  money isn't wasted, where your taxpayer dollars aren't being destroyed. The Democratic Party has [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2767.6s)]
*  an opportunity to stand up and say, we don't want to have things like regulatory capture or this pork [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2771.7599999999998s)]
*  or inside stuff going on. They have an opportunity to make that the core set of beliefs that still [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2777.44s)]
*  aligns with reducing government and increasing efficiency in government. Efficiency in government [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2782.96s)]
*  should not be a party issue. By allowing the Republicans to say we're for efficient government, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2787.7599999999998s)]
*  it implies that the Democrats now to be opposite of that are saying we're for inefficient [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2792.8s)]
*  government. And if the Democrats want to win this, they can actually take that message and say, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2796.8s)]
*  you know what, we're for more efficient government. And the way we're going to do it is get rid of [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2800.96s)]
*  things like regulatory capture and inside deals and all the other sort of stuff. It may, you know, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2805.04s)]
*  that may not kind of go, but there's an opportunity for the Democrats, I think, to really stand up [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2810.2400000000002s)]
*  and take the country in the direction that we all as Americans needed to go to, which is to have a [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2814.88s)]
*  sustainable federal government. And that's going to require some degree of fiscal conservatism and [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2819.76s)]
*  action. But they could take a different point of view on how they do it. And they could have core [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2824.32s)]
*  beliefs around that. It's really and by the way, Dean Phillips, we're inviting back on the program [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2827.5200000000004s)]
*  as recline Sam Harris, we want to have some more people on the left come on here and maybe talk [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2832.2400000000002s)]
*  about this very issue. It's really three things they can work on. Number one, build 10 million [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2836.1600000000003s)]
*  homes in this country that are affordable. That's a really key issue. Rich people should pay their [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2840.88s)]
*  fair share of taxes and reform the tax code. And then third, health care for everyone, those three [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2846.64s)]
*  would get this party back on track, we're going to make a more efficient government, you're going [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2853.3599999999997s)]
*  to be able to buy a home, you're going to get health care, and rich people are going to start [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2857.2s)]
*  paying their taxes, which they're not. And we're going to stop with these crazy Trump tax breaks. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2860.64s)]
*  That would be the perfect positioning. And it's not personal. It's just, hey, we're a rich enough [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2864.16s)]
*  country, that people should get health care. Why shouldn't people have health care in the modern [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2868.8799999999997s)]
*  world? Why can't these rich people who are donating 10s of millions of dollars to Trump, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2872.72s)]
*  just pay some more taxes and make sure poor people have basic health care? Sayan, your thoughts? And [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2876.72s)]
*  then let's get back to the docket. Well, I disagree with all those points, obviously, but [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2881.4399999999996s)]
*  sure, they could run on them. They have tried they've they've definitely said we're going to [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2886.24s)]
*  have you know, health care for all, you know, selling the American dream of home ownership, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2890.56s)]
*  I actually think is flawed in many ways. We're putting people into debt. And for things they [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2894.7999999999997s)]
*  can't afford, and they get screwed. And so I just actually think they need to find a unifying figure [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2900.88s)]
*  out who their moderates are. And there's also politically homeless people, we didn't include [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2908.88s)]
*  them. You know, there's these people who are just like, well, I can't vote right, and I'm not left [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2912.4s)]
*  either anymore. So we've got to bridge this divide somehow. And they've got to figure out the messaging, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2917.28s)]
*  but I don't think going back to what they used to do is going to work, because they promised [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2923.2000000000003s)]
*  universal health care and it hasn't happened. And they had plenty of opportunity to do so. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2927.44s)]
*  All right, let's get back to the whiz deal and the and the docket here. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2933.04s)]
*  Let's see if we did anything we didn't. Well, I should just talk about the, you know, the price [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2936.8s)]
*  they paid, and we should talk about how to do that, the strategic rationale, and how others are going [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2942.2400000000002s)]
*  to respond. All right, so looking at this, the deal got sweetened massively over the year, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2947.44s)]
*  between when the first offer was made for 23 billion, and then went up to 32 billion, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2953.12s)]
*  the revenue roughly doubled since the time of the first offer. And then there's some really [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2958.3199999999997s)]
*  interesting things in the details. There's a huge breakup fee, we saw the breakup fee with Adobe and [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2964.4s)]
*  Figma. This one is tremendous. It's 10% of the deal size $3.2 billion in cash, they don't get an [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2969.52s)]
*  investment. If this deal doesn't go through, Google has to give ways $3.2 billion in cash, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2976.0s)]
*  let that sink in. This company is massively high growth, zero to 100 million in there in 18 months [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2981.2s)]
*  when they started. And last year, they passed 500 million in ARR, you know, that puts the deal [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2988.3199999999997s)]
*  at roughly 60 times their run rate, and that is a high price. However, they're supposed to hit [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=2994.56s)]
*  a billion in ARR this year, which would put it at 30 times forward looking or 32 times, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3002.08s)]
*  which isn't outrageous, because Google probably has freeburg some concept or alphabet rather, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3008.32s)]
*  some concept of how they could increase the velocity of that. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3014.0800000000004s)]
*  Of that revenue. Yeah, or that it would be a defensive position. One of those two. Yeah. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3018.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, just to put it in context, right, Google's cloud revenue is about 40 billion a year. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3024.1600000000003s)]
*  And Microsoft and Amazon's are both kind of plus or minus a little bit around 100 billion a year. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3031.04s)]
*  And so Google has kind of been, as we know, lagging a little bit in the cloud market. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3037.6s)]
*  The thing about kind of enterprise sales is there's a common strategy, which is you kind of [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3044.3199999999997s)]
*  land with a beachhead and then you kind of expand from there with additional products and services. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3051.12s)]
*  This has been the reason so many enterprise software companies over time, from Oracle to [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3056.24s)]
*  Salesforce to Microsoft, have been acquisitive and can make acquisitions very synergistic. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3062.0s)]
*  What that means is you can acquire a new product or a new service and then sell it into your [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3069.92s)]
*  install base or acquire the customers and then cross sell your existing products or services into [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3074.4s)]
*  their install base. And so you can increase the overall revenue by putting the two together and [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3081.12s)]
*  combining sales teams and being able to offer a combined offering. And so the theory here, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3085.36s)]
*  and I think this is something I don't understand well enough, is that security [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3090.56s)]
*  has become such a kind of top requirement and product category that it now effectively [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3095.2s)]
*  enables a beachhead type model to be successful, meaning you can cross sell the security into all [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3102.7999999999997s)]
*  of your existing customers or there's enough new customers that Google might be acquiring from the [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3108.08s)]
*  Wiz acquisition that they can now bring new GCP services to and cross sell into. Now, to figure [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3112.56s)]
*  out how this actually has to make sense, Google's ROIC is about 30%. That means that when they make [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3119.76s)]
*  an investment, a CapEx investment or a capital investment, they expect to see about 30% of [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3126.7200000000003s)]
*  incremental profit per year come back at some point from that capital investment. The capital [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3132.0800000000004s)]
*  investment they're making here, again, this doesn't hit their income statement, goes on their balance [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3138.0s)]
*  sheet. It gets marked mostly as goodwill. So Google's going to have a 32 billion move from cash [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3141.6800000000003s)]
*  down to goodwill. So now they've got this asset on their balance sheet and they've got to make an [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3148.0s)]
*  incremental $10 billion a year profit. So you kind of got to do the math, $10 billion a year [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3151.68s)]
*  of incremental profit against 40 billion of cloud revenue and against 1 billion of Wiz revenue. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3156.24s)]
*  There's a lot to be kind of built here to make this make financial sense. So then it becomes, [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3164.32s)]
*  okay, well, that's a really hard one to kind of think that they're going to get there very soon. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3170.24s)]
*  But remember, Google's made some investments like- [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3173.76s)]
*  I think it's a very tricky, you said it earlier, actually, it's a Trojan horse into the other [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3176.48s)]
*  clouds. The reason Wiz exists, and Jason mentioned this upfront, is because of the value that it [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3181.6800000000003s)]
*  creates in a multi-cloud multi-tenant environment across Azure and GCP and AWS. And when the deal [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3187.6000000000004s)]
*  was done, one of the things that Wiz said is, hey, don't worry, we're not going to prefer GCP. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3193.6800000000003s)]
*  And it was interesting because I thought, wait, people actually thought that they would just [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3199.44s)]
*  prefer GCP. Note, it's the exact opposite of why Google would want this. Because now what you have [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3203.44s)]
*  are your tentacles. Think of any other service that any cloud provider provides where most of [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3209.6s)]
*  your revenue is coming from the other clouds. Can you name one? Well, it didn't exist until now. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3216.88s)]
*  And so I think the strategic rationale is quite clever, which is you start to gain customer [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3222.8s)]
*  traction and workloads in all of these other environments. And I suspect that TK [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3228.08s)]
*  is smart enough to try to pull these workloads back into GCP. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3232.72s)]
*  So that's like, I think probably like- [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3237.6s)]
*  Because they were, you're saying, Shubhap, they would have the data they would be able to see [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3239.84s)]
*  from Wiz, like, hey, look, 90% of this type of job is existing on Oracle or it's over here on [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3243.52s)]
*  AWS or Azure. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3249.84s)]
*  Every of you would do that if you're running Google Cloud. Thomas Curian is smart enough and [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3250.64s)]
*  they're not going to pay. And David, by the way, the other thing that I would say is, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3254.96s)]
*  I think this is where bankers get this totally wrong as the observer watching a deal like this [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3258.56s)]
*  is it's never about the rate of change when you're trying to do a deal. It's always about the rate [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3263.6s)]
*  of change of the rate of change. And the most incredible thing that Wiz had going for itself [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3269.2s)]
*  was that they were basically doubling in months. So the time to double at that scale, you can do [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3274.08s)]
*  any kind of fantastical model with that kind of raw input. Because when that boundary condition [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3281.36s)]
*  is true and you're trying to de-escalate or scale down or weigh down a model, you're still [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3286.2400000000002s)]
*  going to get crazy gargantuan numbers that when you discount them back, gets them to this price. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3292.08s)]
*  So, I mean, congrats to these guys. I would love to find out how does Wiz, because this is, [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3297.04s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure you guys have this question too. How do you build a sales infrastructure [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3303.1200000000003s)]
*  that can scale that productively that quickly? That's an incredible thing. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3308.24s)]
*  You know? How do you do that? [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3312.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I wonder if it's a lot of self-serve. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3314.3999999999996s)]
*  It's got to be self-serve. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3316.24s)]
*  It's got to be some percentage of it. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3317.8399999999997s)]
*  But I mean, I'll tell you our experiences. We had a guy that had to come in and sell it into us, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3319.8399999999997s)]
*  and we had a little bit of a bake off. And I don't know, maybe we were unique and there's [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3323.44s)]
*  a simpler lower scale product that's just more pay go. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3326.72s)]
*  Consumption, yeah. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3330.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3332.3199999999997s)]
*  Who knows? So, yeah, looking at this, I'm curious your take on big VC because the Series A, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3333.04s)]
*  $100 million round, we don't have the valuation for it. The B was at $1.7 billion a year later, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3340.4s)]
*  so maybe we assume it was a $500 million valuation for 20%, something like that, I would guess. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3345.04s)]
*  Maybe a $600 million post. Sequoia, Insight, Index, CyberStarts, all did that Series A. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3350.08s)]
*  When you look at the BCD&E, those same players all participated. This is another example of [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3355.68s)]
*  sometimes your best next investment as a VC firm is the highest growth outlier in your existing [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3363.04s)]
*  portfolio. Your thoughts on what this means in terms of venture capital and maybe the log jam [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3369.2799999999997s)]
*  that we saw over the last four years, five years of no M&A. Because you and I came up when it was a [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3373.84s)]
*  golden era of M&A and then the IPO market started to open up with Airbnb, Coinbase, and of course, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3382.64s)]
*  Uber. Now we're sitting here, if this is the starter's pistol, what could it look like [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3388.4s)]
*  for the VC industry, which has just been dead for the last four or five years? [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3394.56s)]
*  My thoughts on WIZ, I think this is really exciting for me because this is a great example [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3399.6800000000003s)]
*  of a contrarian investment. When this investment was initially made, there was not a lot of money [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3404.7200000000003s)]
*  going into security. There still isn't. It's an under-invested category. And with AI and the [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3410.56s)]
*  threat of the types of things that people can build and vibe coding and everything in between, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3415.68s)]
*  you're going to need better security. And so I'm excited to see that maybe this might become an [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3420.96s)]
*  investable category. I think this is the largest exit ever in the security space. Am I wrong? [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3426.56s)]
*  I mean, I think you're probably correct. I don't think I've ever heard of anything this large. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3432.0s)]
*  M&A wise, absolutely. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3438.24s)]
*  Yeah. So, you know, how does this impact M&A? I mean, it's still pretty slow out there. You know, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3439.2799999999997s)]
*  some action's better than no action, but like Niantic was just bought by Scopely. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3444.64s)]
*  We're starting to see some- [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3449.3599999999997s)]
*  You were an angel investor in that, right? [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3450.16s)]
*  I was. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3451.68s)]
*  That was the Pokemon Go, folks. I remember you showing me Pokemon Go over a decade ago. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3451.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3456.24s)]
*  That's amazing. That's a Saudi company that bought it? It looks like a Saudi conglomerate. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3456.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's a Saudi conglomerate. And so that exited for 3.7 billion. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3460.8799999999997s)]
*  And, you know, I think we're going to start seeing some movement, especially with the new [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3465.3599999999997s)]
*  administration. When we start- [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3469.44s)]
*  How long were you in that deal? How many years were you in that? [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3470.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh, I gosh. As soon as they spun out an alphabet formed and spun them out as their own entity, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3474.56s)]
*  I- there's a funny story for another time about how I got into the deal. But I realized it was [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3480.08s)]
*  my only opportunity to get in as early as possible. And so I stalked the founder and sat at his door. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3485.84s)]
*  And- [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3491.2s)]
*  Oh, tell us the story. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3491.36s)]
*  Okay. All right. Well- [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3492.32s)]
*  Permission granted. You can't say it's a great story. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3493.68s)]
*  Yeah, it was a great story. So before Pokemon Go, they had this game called Ingress. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3495.84s)]
*  And I started playing it with my friends and I started noticing that my friends were [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3500.4s)]
*  doing some really unusual things. They were like charting helicopters and like [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3504.6400000000003s)]
*  traveling all over the world to cast these invisible triangles over the earth. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3509.44s)]
*  Basically, it's a game of green versus blue and who can cast the biggest triangle. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3513.52s)]
*  I was like, why are these people spending so much time? And not only that, but why are they [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3517.84s)]
*  going around taking pictures of points of interest for Google? Like what is Google [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3521.76s)]
*  actually doing with this asset was my number one question. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3526.08s)]
*  So I realized that Ingress was part of a bigger mapping plan. I mean, if you look at the team, [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3529.6800000000003s)]
*  you look at John Hanke, they all come from Keyhole and they're obviously part of the [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3535.6000000000004s)]
*  maps team and help build Google Earth. So this wasn't just a game. Pokemon Go was a joke. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3539.28s)]
*  It was basically an April Fool's joke where the founder of Pokemon said, wouldn't it be cool if [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3544.0s)]
*  we put Pokemon on the map and we just tried to find them? And John Hanke's like, yeah, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3550.0800000000004s)]
*  let's turn this into an Ingress-like game. I went around telling everybody like if I had a chance [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3556.0s)]
*  to invest in anything, it would be Niantic. And because they were part of Google, I thought there [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3561.76s)]
*  was no chance. And then I got a call one day and they said, hey, my friend of mine was like, [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3566.64s)]
*  did you hear Niantic spun out? I was like, oh my gosh, I don't know anyone at Google. How do I [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3570.88s)]
*  reach John Hanke? And I realized I'd invested in this company called Hentwater and they were [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3575.04s)]
*  giving out game codes on the bottle cap. And I was setting up her ticketing system one day [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3580.32s)]
*  and helping her out in her office. And I saw all these tickets coming in with the subject line that [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3585.6s)]
*  said Ingress game code. And I was like, what is this all about? And I just connected the dots and [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3589.6s)]
*  she introduced me to John Hanke. And then I went there with two engineers because I figured I got [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3593.36s)]
*  to show up with some value here. Two badass engineers who are players. We sat on the front [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3597.44s)]
*  stairs and basically sat there and said, please take our money. He's like, I don't need you. I've [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3603.68s)]
*  got Nintendo. I've got Google. I've got, and we're like, no, you really need us. And he gave one of [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3607.6s)]
*  those engineers a job offer pretty much that day. He gave me a key card to the office. And so I can [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3613.68s)]
*  come and go from Niantic as I please, which is pretty awesome. But it's just a fun story, you know? [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3619.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean, this is what it takes to get in deals in Silicon Valley. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3624.3199999999997s)]
*  All right. The Fed held rate steady on Wednesday. Markets have been digesting this pretty flat. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3628.16s)]
*  The second consecutive meeting, of course, where the Fed held rates steady. This is after the two [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3634.24s)]
*  consecutive cuts in September, 50 basis points in September, and then obviously 25 in December. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3641.12s)]
*  And we had this high hopes that there would be, you know, four or five of these cuts this year, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3648.08s)]
*  and there are apparently none right now. Trump posted on Truth Social that he urged the Fed to [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3652.08s)]
*  cut rates to create a smoother transition for his tariffs. The tariffs are taking place, I believe, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3658.08s)]
*  on April 2nd is that date. That's going to change the history of the United States forever. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3662.48s)]
*  And so there were some other interesting takeaways. They lowered expectations on [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3667.28s)]
*  rate cuts. They expect two quarter point cuts for the rest of 2025. This would take us down to about [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3670.0s)]
*  4%. Your thoughts, Shema? Let's add some color from Scott Besson. One of the biggest mistakes [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3674.48s)]
*  that I think Janet Yellen affected was this continued issuance of money on the short end [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3682.5600000000004s)]
*  of the curve to finance these deficits, which gives you, you inherit an incredibly difficult [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3690.7200000000003s)]
*  challenge, I think, over the next nine months. I think there's like nine or 10 trillion that [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3697.44s)]
*  has to get refinanced. Do you want to talk about that? Yeah, look, I thought that when rates were [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3701.44s)]
*  low, you're supposed to turn out rates. Exactly. And instead, the Treasury for the past few years [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3708.4s)]
*  has pulled rates in. And I think part of that was to keep rates lower, that they change the [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3716.7999999999997s)]
*  issuance schedule when rates move back up towards 5%. I have maintained that policy, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3724.08s)]
*  but I'm maintaining it because, let's go back to David's question, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3734.24s)]
*  when are we going to see the results from this, getting the government spending under control? [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3738.48s)]
*  And I don't think the markets recognize it yet. Okay, translated for us, Shema. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3744.16s)]
*  So he's saying a couple things. He has inherited a problem that he hasn't quite yet changed. What is [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3749.92s)]
*  that problem? That problem is that when rates are low, you want to borrow from the government, [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3756.32s)]
*  change. What is that problem? That problem is that when rates are low, you want to borrow for [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3762.16s)]
*  as long as possible, right? You don't want to borrow for the shortest amount of time. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3768.08s)]
*  And now that rates are high, you're in this difficult position where you have to refinance [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3772.8799999999997s)]
*  all of it at a much higher rate. That's effectively the net of it. What I took away, and you can see [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3777.6s)]
*  more and understand more when you watch this whole interview with Friedberg and I, but I think that [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3783.8399999999997s)]
*  there's been a fundamental disconnect and break from the Fed and the rest of Treasury and the [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3789.2s)]
*  government. And I think that Scott was very clear, like he views that as an independent organization [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3796.72s)]
*  and it should continue that way. But it was very clear to me that they are singing from their own [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3802.64s)]
*  hymn book. And it just doesn't seem to me that Powell really understands the gravity of this [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3807.3599999999997s)]
*  situation. And I don't think that he's really willing to play ball. So he's probably on the [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3813.2799999999997s)]
*  margins. Again, this is my total interpretation of this. Would rather wait longer than necessary [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3820.08s)]
*  because I think it's almost like a political gambit. And I think that that's very dangerous. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3827.2799999999997s)]
*  That's again, just my own interpretation. I just do not think that Powell, A, has the data to make [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3832.48s)]
*  a very clear decision and B, will act unless it's totally necessary. So I think there's an [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3839.52s)]
*  overcorrection here that's happening, which I think is dangerous. And I think it's going to slow down [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3846.96s)]
*  the pace of cuts, which I think will then create a lot of other pressure in the economy. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3851.84s)]
*  Aaron Powell Well, Dave, I'll drop it to you. The Fed's mandate as an independent organization [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3859.52s)]
*  is full employment. And that 2% target, which we talked about before here was just a number that [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3865.04s)]
*  was picked by an economist in New Zealand, of all places. It's not like it's some specific [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3870.16s)]
*  dosage that is perfect, but it is their mandate. They're not supposed to be a political [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3876.64s)]
*  organization. So what are your thoughts on this situation and these high rates, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3881.6s)]
*  which we have to pay for our debt? [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3887.12s)]
*  Dave Iverson We've never been in a situation where in 100 days, [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3890.32s)]
*  a federal government is setting out to cut their spending by a trillion dollars, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3897.36s)]
*  which has a significant effect, a recessionary effect on the economy, because there's less [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3902.4s)]
*  federal dollars flowing out, which goes as revenue into various businesses and income for a lot of [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3908.16s)]
*  people that are employed as contractors or directly by federal government agencies. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3914.0s)]
*  Coupled with, for the first time in 100 years, a significant change in the policy for tariffs [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3918.48s)]
*  for goods flowing into the United States, and whether that will reduce spending by consumers or [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3926.08s)]
*  drive up the cost of products by consumers. And we talked extensively about both of these issues [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3931.92s)]
*  with Besson and Letnik in DC this week. And if I'm the Fed, I don't really have a great proxy [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3936.96s)]
*  historically for saying when this was done in the past, here's what the effect would be [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3945.2799999999997s)]
*  on GDP. Here's what the effect would be on inflation. Here's what the effect is going to be [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3950.48s)]
*  on employment. In fact, folks like Letnik are making the case that the current measure of GDP [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3955.3599999999997s)]
*  is probably not even correct, the way we measure it, the way we count it. And so the traditional [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3964.96s)]
*  economist's point of view on making rate adjustments as a function of [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3971.3599999999997s)]
*  economic contraction or growth may be wrong. So I think there are quite a lot of these kind of [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3977.04s)]
*  confounding factors that the Fed is in a very wait and see mode. What I would look to is the bond [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3982.9599999999996s)]
*  market, which also seems to be in a kind of wait and see mode. So remember, right before the election, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3988.72s)]
*  rates went down to about 3.65%. About a month ago, the tenure was at 4.5%. And today it's at 4.22%. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=3994.96s)]
*  And so in the last month, we've seen rates on the tenure decline by about a quarter point or about [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4001.04s)]
*  30 basis points. And so the bond market is giving some kind of opening to the Fed saying, look, we [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4007.28s)]
*  expect that the Fed is going to be able to do a good job of making a good trade. And so the bond [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4014.48s)]
*  market is saying, look, we expect that this is going to be deflationary. This is going to be [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4021.52s)]
*  recessionary. We are expecting you to cut rates to the Fed. And so that's what the bond market is [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4024.56s)]
*  saying. And now I think we're going to start to wait for the reports that are going to start to [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4031.6800000000003s)]
*  come out that are going to show the impact. I don't think we're going to know immediately. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4036.2400000000002s)]
*  So I think the first hundred days of this presidency and this administration's actions [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4041.84s)]
*  are going to be pretty telling on what's going to happen going forward in terms of the effect on [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4046.24s)]
*  employment, on inflation, and on GDP contraction or growth. And then I think the market will know [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4050.72s)]
*  how to handicap those numbers in the future based on actions by the administration. Right now, [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4058.3999999999996s)]
*  we're still in a like, I don't know how, when you put all these things together, what it does. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4064.3999999999996s)]
*  And it's a lot happening real fast. And so wait and see. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4068.16s)]
*  I don't know if they're not communicating it well. Besant did that. It's the effect that it [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4070.96s)]
*  will have ultimately on the economy and over what time scale. That's what's uncertain right now. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4074.4s)]
*  Sorry, go ahead. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4078.16s)]
*  Specifically the tariffs. I mean, you know, if they're on, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4078.96s)]
*  if they're on, they're on the table. And so I think that's what's going to be happening. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4082.0s)]
*  And I think that's what's going to be happening. And I think that's what's going to be happening [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4086.0s)]
*  in the next couple of weeks. And I think that's what's going to be happening in the next couple [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4089.6s)]
*  of weeks. And I think that's what's going to be happening in the next couple of weeks. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4093.44s)]
*  Specifically the tariffs. I mean, you know, if they're on, they're off. To what extent, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4097.92s)]
*  you know, I don't, it doesn't feel like the entire administration is on the same page. That's just, [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4103.2s)]
*  you know, based on everybody I've talked to. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4107.92s)]
*  The Fed is not part of the administration. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4109.68s)]
*  Of course not. Yes, they're independent. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4111.44s)]
*  And the quote today in the Wall Street Journal, Nick, you can look for it, is Powell's statement [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4112.96s)]
*  basically blamed rising inflation in the short-term period on exogenous factors. He said, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4117.04s)]
*  our job was getting the job done. And now there's exogenous inflation. And I think what he's [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4122.16s)]
*  pointing to are these potential tariffs or something. So I think it's, it's less that [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4126.88s)]
*  they're not coordinated. I think that they are on very different pages and I don't think the Fed [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4130.639999999999s)]
*  wants to play ball. Sorry, and then I have a story at the end. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4135.44s)]
*  Just quickly, you know, one of the things that really concerns me is how we've been so high on [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4138.0s)]
*  cheap supply for so long. Like if you look at Shein and Timo before this podcast, I wouldn't [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4142.24s)]
*  looked up that their prices are up by 27% or something like that. And so when you used to be [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4147.76s)]
*  able to get a garment for $18, you're now paying $37 and Zara is like 75 for an equivalent. And I [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4152.400000000001s)]
*  think people really liked getting packages in the mail and feeling like their dollar went further [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4159.2s)]
*  and it's not going far. And so when you have a bunch of people who can't buy anything and [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4163.6s)]
*  consumerism is a big part of our, unfortunately in some ways, our culture, you know, what does that do [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4168.64s)]
*  to our country? You know, if you're looking around, there's urban blight everywhere in retail [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4173.92s)]
*  and you know, we can't fill our malls. We don't have brick and mortar stores. They're shutting [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4180.16s)]
*  down forever 21 just shut down. You know, these are the types of things that, you know, people [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4184.96s)]
*  really care about is whether, especially in a time where, you know, you do have a recession. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4190.24s)]
*  People want to buy a tube of lipstick or, or a dress to feel better about their life. And right [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4196.08s)]
*  now they can't even do that. And so that's, that's what concerns me is thinking about the retail [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4203.04s)]
*  future and then, you know, the consumer landscape of how this all affects everybody. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4207.92s)]
*  Yeah. And consumer confidence is not good right now. People are feeling like a little bit concerned [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4212.96s)]
*  about it. And this immigration plays into this. We're supposed to be deporting 20 million people. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4217.36s)]
*  Maybe it's only going to be a million. Who knows about that issue? Who's going to actually work [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4222.5599999999995s)]
*  in these factories? Are people getting laid off or are they not getting laid off? Like there's just [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4226.639999999999s)]
*  a soup of issues here that makes the feds job extremely difficult. So in an extremely difficult, [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4231.36s)]
*  confusing storm, what is the best thing to do when you're driving the storms? Just maybe try to keep [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4237.12s)]
*  the car going straight, not hit the brakes or not hit the gas. And that's what they're doing. They're [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4241.839999999999s)]
*  taking a wait and see. And let's see if the administration can be a little bit crisper, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4246.0s)]
*  I think, in their delivery of what their plan is, because it does seem chaotic to me. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4250.16s)]
*  People here might disagree. So you said you had an anecdote. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4255.92s)]
*  Well, I kind of disagree with you in one way. I just think the Fed has totally lost a script. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4259.12s)]
*  And I don't think they're doing what they're supposed to be doing. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4263.679999999999s)]
*  What should they be doing? [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4267.759999999999s)]
*  What they should be doing is actually observing the fact that there's some [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4269.36s)]
*  very complicated money flows. The front end of the curve makes no sense. The back end of the [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4272.48s)]
*  curve hasn't gone down long enough. They sat around and they allowed treasury to basically pump [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4276.799999999999s)]
*  trillions of short-term paper. So they were complicit in what Yellen did. And it's [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4282.4800000000005s)]
*  inconceivable that they didn't understand that strategy. And so it's inconceivable. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4289.12s)]
*  That's the past. So what's the future? Yeah. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4292.24s)]
*  So what do you do when you have a, is recalcitrant the right word? Let's just say you just have an [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4294.64s)]
*  organization that refuses to play ball. Again, there was a really interesting anecdote where [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4300.4800000000005s)]
*  Besant talked in the interview about how he really wants to deregulate and loosen up [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4305.84s)]
*  bank lending standards, particularly at the community level. And I think that this is one [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4313.6s)]
*  very interesting thing that is a workaround to the Fed. Why? Because if you think about where money [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4319.360000000001s)]
*  gets transacted on a 10 to 20 to 30 year duration, those are the big boys. They're making big capital [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4325.52s)]
*  plays, right guys? But where is like the, where do you play for the two month to two year kind of [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4331.92s)]
*  thing? It's smaller stuff. It's the stuff that's required to get small businesses off the ground. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4338.72s)]
*  It's the community lending standards that actually allow communities to thrive. And so I think Scott [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4343.12s)]
*  realizes that if the Fed's not going to really play ball, how do you loosen credit? How do you make [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4349.12s)]
*  sure that that money's available, Jason, to make sure that you can fight off recession? You have [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4355.4400000000005s)]
*  to give it to these smaller banks. And he was pretty clear about that. So I think that that's [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4359.6s)]
*  it's almost as if the Fed is just going to get relegated to this like random organization, like, [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4365.04s)]
*  yeah, they'll control reverse repo, but they just won't have any credibility. And [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4370.400000000001s)]
*  maybe that's not a bad thing, actually, in the end. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4375.280000000001s)]
*  Freberg, it's your chance to shine. We have not one, but we have two amazing space stories in [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4377.200000000001s)]
*  Science Corner. First up, SpaceX successfully rescued two astronauts. And when they landed, [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4384.8s)]
*  there were dolphins breaching around the capsule was absolutely magical to see. Congratulations to [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4390.16s)]
*  the SpaceX team on that. And then Firefly Aerospace completed its moon mission after [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4397.12s)]
*  achieving the first commercial soft lunar landing. Take it whichever way you want, [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4402.64s)]
*  Freberg, which one of these do you want to start with? And then maybe we'll open the discussion up [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4407.6s)]
*  to a little bit broader discussion about the moon itself. SpaceX was able to rescue the two [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4412.56s)]
*  astronauts that were stranded by the Boeing Starliner debacle nine months ago. We talked [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4419.68s)]
*  about it on the show. You can go back and watch the episode. Episode 192, 192 in August. Episode [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4424.56s)]
*  192. And so having spent far more on the Starliner program than on the Crew Dragon program, the [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4430.160000000001s)]
*  Starliner program is gone now. It's basically done. And the Crew Dragon program has now done [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4439.2s)]
*  16 crewed flights to space, 11 for NASA, four private commercial flights, and continues to [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4445.04s)]
*  perform. So congratulations to the SpaceX team on making it to ISS and bringing the astronauts home, [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4454.4s)]
*  another successful mission for SpaceX. You know, there's a lot of hand wringing, [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4460.88s)]
*  oh my god, you know, conflict of interest, Elon with SpaceX and Doge and being close to the [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4465.04s)]
*  administration. When we look at what SpaceX has accomplished, I'm not a shareholder, but I know [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4472.0s)]
*  you are Chamath. I'm not sure if we have folks in the panel. You are as well, Sayan. I am as well. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4477.68s)]
*  Okay, congratulations, everybody. But putting aside our personal investments, when you look [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4482.0s)]
*  at how much they've reduced the cost, is anybody even close to matching their cost to getting to [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4488.08s)]
*  space? Because this kind of like takes out the whole hand wringing around the conflict of interest [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4494.16s)]
*  with SpaceX, both on Starlink and on this seems ridiculous because the price is so cheap. It makes [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4501.92s)]
*  no sense to even complain about it. We should just be giving Elon a high five and saying thanks for [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4509.2s)]
*  charging at such a low rate. It's a great question. Sayan, you want to take it? [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4512.96s)]
*  Well, you know, obviously, Boeing is the big loser here. You've barely got to, you know, [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4518.64s)]
*  it's interesting to me how bad they just fumbled this. And then there's the political element. I [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4523.52s)]
*  don't know if we want to get into it about how we weren't able to save these astronauts and they [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4528.48s)]
*  were stuck up there. You know, we were seeing it landing in the water, but what you're not seeing [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4533.12s)]
*  is they couldn't walk when they got out and they were only supposed to be there for what, like 10 days? [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4537.04s)]
*  Yeah, eight days and it ended up eight months or something. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4541.52s)]
*  Yeah, eight months, which is horrendous because one of the things that I believe that America [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4544.24s)]
*  stands for is we don't leave people like that. And it's an American issue, not a political one. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4549.44s)]
*  And so there's no reason why we shouldn't have engaged SpaceX sooner. It was offered and they [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4555.44s)]
*  turned it into a completely political issue and Boeing fumbled the ball. And so, you know, I, [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4560.639999999999s)]
*  I think hopefully this is a message that's loud and clear. And one of the things I'm so excited [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4566.08s)]
*  about is little kids watching this and seeing this and what it means for the future of our country, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4570.4s)]
*  because they're looking up to people like Elon and they're going to be the next political class [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4576.24s)]
*  in the future. And that will matter. You know, this is the equivalent of the moon landing. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4580.639999999999s)]
*  And to see somebody in private enterprise do what Elon has done is just outstanding. So [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4585.5199999999995s)]
*  that's basically my comment on it. Any thoughts on the cost versus [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4591.2s)]
*  conflict of interest, I guess, hand-wringing? Look, there's, there's a couple of startup [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4594.32s)]
*  alternatives. I'll put alternatives in quotes because they're not really [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4598.72s)]
*  GA. They're not generally available. They're not really launching. They're still in this [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4603.4400000000005s)]
*  early experimentation phase. One is Blue Origin and the second is Relativity Space. The problem with [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4607.12s)]
*  both of those two approaches, well, the, the feature of both of those two approaches is [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4614.400000000001s)]
*  theoretically that there's a different economic model there. But the reality is that SpaceX is [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4618.240000000001s)]
*  the only company that has consistently been able to take these costs and just crunch them down to [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4624.48s)]
*  like more than one launch a day this year, I think, like it's just an incredible scale and pace. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4630.24s)]
*  So no, there is no economic alternative. They are the absolute cheapest in the market. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4637.839999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'll tell you a very quick story. I was also an investor in Relativity. I think I owned [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4642.719999999999s)]
*  about 10% of the company and I just got recapped out of that business because they needed a lot [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4647.919999999999s)]
*  more money than folks were willing to give it. And then Eric Schmidt just stepped up and offered, [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4653.76s)]
*  I think, $3 billion to the business. And I kind of said, no, I'm done. I'm out of here. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4658.400000000001s)]
*  So, you know, recaps are painful. You put all that money in. I think I took like a $380 million loss. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4663.280000000001s)]
*  It was not a, it was not a good week two weeks ago, but anyways, that's not the point. The point is [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4668.400000000001s)]
*  SpaceX is the best. There is nobody even close. The next closest alternative is years and years [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4672.8s)]
*  away. Would we benefit from more capacity? Sure. But the reality is they are the only solution [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4679.04s)]
*  and they're safe and they're reliable. And what Saian said is so true. When the hell does America [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4686.0s)]
*  just abandon people? Why do you do that? Especially in space of all places. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4691.76s)]
*  I mean, that is really dark. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4701.28s)]
*  You would think this would be a Mark Watney story, like the Martian. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4702.88s)]
*  Look, you have WNBA players that get put in Russian jail. We're willing to swap them for arms [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4706.64s)]
*  dealers in the last administration. Fine. So we didn't abandon her, but then we let these two [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4712.56s)]
*  people flounder. I just think it's really inexcusable. That makes no sense. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4721.76s)]
*  There definitely needs to be an investigation into what happened there. A lot of speculation. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4726.16s)]
*  It doesn't look good. I'm going to take Elon as the word that he offered. I mean, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4731.2s)]
*  I don't see any reason why he would not offer. The astronauts even confirmed that he offered. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4735.04s)]
*  Oh, they did? Okay. I mean, I know that people were saying like unconfirmed if the Biden [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4738.72s)]
*  administration assumed. They were like, that's their way of saying, come get me. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4742.8s)]
*  Please come get me. They're like, I'm literally withering away in space. Please come get me. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4747.68s)]
*  They put their thumbs up. Okay, come pick us up. Freeberg, take us to the next story. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4751.6s)]
*  And then we'll get a wrap here. This is basically what I think is going to end up being the story [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4757.44s)]
*  over the next couple of years is the space race between effectively SpaceX's platform and technology [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4762.64s)]
*  versus China, which has effectively ripped off SpaceX, as this is being described here in this [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4769.12s)]
*  article. So you can kind of take a look at the Long March 9 rocket is what they call it. Fully [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4775.92s)]
*  reusable first stage powered by 30 of their particular engines, which is comparable to [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4782.160000000001s)]
*  SpaceX's first stage being powered by 33 Raptor engines, also fueled with methane and liquid [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4788.72s)]
*  oxygen, each with a thrust of about 280 tons compared to the Chinese at 200 tons. This is [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4794.8s)]
*  kind of a very kind of equivalent design. Right. Here's a look at it. Yeah. And there's the model [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4800.72s)]
*  of the reusable. Yeah. So this is the Long March 9. This is their super heavy lift rocket that they [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4805.84s)]
*  kind of first started talking about, call it a decade ago. The rocket has three stages, solid [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4812.0s)]
*  motors, they've recalibrated the design and it effectively has now kind of become a clone of [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4816.88s)]
*  Starship. And so this whole system is going to be the big race. And as we know, the way the Chinese [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4823.12s)]
*  operate when it comes to kind of industrialization is they can move fast, they can move big, they can [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4829.6s)]
*  move heavy, they can dedicate resources, they can dedicate an entirely vertically integrated supply [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4833.6s)]
*  chain to achieving an objective. So this will end up being kind of, I think, the big race over the [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4838.56s)]
*  next couple of years. Slave labor. They've got a lot of resources at their fingertips. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4843.36s)]
*  You can kind of say that, but I don't know, you know, a lot of people use slave labor in China [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4848.5599999999995s)]
*  as kind of a hand wavy way of describing their competitive advantage. But I think this is really [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4853.36s)]
*  important. China has actually much more of an advantage in automation. And so if you look at [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4858.639999999999s)]
*  many Chinese factories that everyone assumes are cheap, because they have cheap slave labor, [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4864.0s)]
*  which is kind of the Western and general kind of media perception of what goes on over there, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4869.36s)]
*  there's actually a lot of automation and engineering that's gone into building these [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4874.08s)]
*  systems that allow them to have much higher throughput at much lower cost. And I think that [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4878.08s)]
*  this is a really kind of key point that the Chinese kind of industrial base and their [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4883.2s)]
*  manufacturing base is so superior to the United States in this moment in time, that the US has to [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4887.599999999999s)]
*  figure out a way to build its manufacturing base up to be competitive in an age of automation. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4893.839999999999s)]
*  Not on a kind of labor to labor system, but on a system of production to system of production [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4899.2s)]
*  basis. And so this is really where we are lagging deeply as a country. And it is part of you saw JD [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4904.32s)]
*  Vance's speech this week on revitalizing kind of manufacturing in the United States, but it has to [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4910.16s)]
*  be advanced manufacturing. It's not just about opening a warehouse and putting which means robots [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4915.599999999999s)]
*  not humans in it because it means both. It means both. But it's about smarter systems. It's about [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4919.44s)]
*  designs on how you do manufacturing. It's about using new things like 3D printing, like automation [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4924.88s)]
*  coupled with great labor, coupled with great people working. But it's about designing entirely [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4932.64s)]
*  new ways of doing manufacturing. And we've stalled out over the last three decades in the United [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4938.0s)]
*  States as we globalized and we handed off all manufacturing to the East and the United States [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4941.68s)]
*  basically just imported manufactured goods while they invested in all of the infrastructure to [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4947.36s)]
*  deliver advanced manufacturing at scale. And so we've got a lot of catching up to do. Otherwise, [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4951.84s)]
*  China will get ahead of us in any product faster than we will ever be able to kind of stay ahead [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4957.68s)]
*  of the game on. And I think we're seeing that in the space race now. And it's definitely worth [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4962.56s)]
*  taking note that this is kind of one core example of this advantage that they've developed for [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4966.16s)]
*  themselves. I'm concerned about the cultural stuff of this. Like America is so ill equipped, [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4970.400000000001s)]
*  especially with this wave of the last eight years of DEI and how it's infiltrated all of [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4975.52s)]
*  our institutions and how we raise our children in this country. Like we taught them that math is [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4981.52s)]
*  racist while China is, you know, their kids are the leaders in AI. You know, DeepSeek should show [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4986.88s)]
*  us that, you know, we have underestimated China every step of the way. And I think it's just a [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4993.280000000001s)]
*  tragedy. You know, I'm working on a book that's coming out called The War on Science, which will [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=4999.040000000001s)]
*  actually expose a friend of mine wrote it. It's a collection of essays exposes just how entrenched [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5004.72s)]
*  this became in every institution from medical science, etc. Like how do we recover from that [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5010.56s)]
*  is how we can compete with China because otherwise we can't. You know, I really honestly [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5016.88s)]
*  don't understand how we're going to do it if we don't. And part of it is seeing these space [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5021.6s)]
*  launches, you know, obviously the next generation of children will be inspired by that. But we have [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5025.360000000001s)]
*  a gap of about eight to 10 years where we lost that advantage. I mean, in San Francisco, we saw [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5029.92s)]
*  it up close and personal, right? They banned AP math. I mean, what lunatics could ever, I mean, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5035.28s)]
*  I guess the lunatics in San Francisco could literally justify that it was, you know, some [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5042.24s)]
*  massive inequality that the smart kids got to take harder courses. Flash the thing from NBC, Nick, [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5048.56s)]
*  we know who was responsible for it. Are you blaming white women? College educated white women? [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5054.96s)]
*  I'm just saying look at the data. Okay, what is going on here? Like, [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5060.08s)]
*  for those of you not watching, it's a voter's opinion. White men, no degree, white men, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5065.92s)]
*  college degree, white women, no degree, white women, college degree. And yeah, DEI [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5070.72s)]
*  plus 53, no, plus 31. Yeah, for white women in college. Yeah, NBC News probably. Yeah, [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5078.32s)]
*  this is not from, yeah, like a right-wing organization here. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5083.76s)]
*  Just to build on what you were saying, it's math that was told was racist. In one of the best [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5088.16s)]
*  private schools here in Silicon Valley, they taught the girls, these are girls in the best [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5095.280000000001s)]
*  all girls private school in Silicon Valley, that reading was racist. Could you imagine? [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5100.08s)]
*  There was a spreadsheet that these kids had to memorize every day that had every other kid's [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5106.0s)]
*  pronoun. And if you didn't get it right, you'd get in trouble. Well, not only that, but they [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5111.92s)]
*  are taught that you're either an oppressor or you're oppressed and there's no other option. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5118.16s)]
*  And so like if you go to one of these private nice schools, then you're automatically an oppressor. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5122.32s)]
*  So think about that. If you're a kid and you're born bad, inherently bad, evil from birth, [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5127.04s)]
*  what does that do? What does that do? What does that do to your self-worth? Yeah, your desire to [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5134.0s)]
*  actually do anything in society. We have to fix that. I actually think it's one of the number one [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5138.4s)]
*  issues in our country is to get kids excited about being Americans again. We were talking [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5143.12s)]
*  about the Democrat Party. They don't love America on the far left. They hate America and they're [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5149.44s)]
*  very loud and vocal about it. And so I'm glad that their base is shrinking, but it needs to shrink [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5156.48s)]
*  further. And we need to have more unifying messages. And I think SpaceX could be one of [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5162.639999999999s)]
*  those unifying messages where we bring people together and we encourage kids to think bigger [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5167.2s)]
*  about the future. I'll tell you one anecdote. I have been hanging out at UT a little bit, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5172.32s)]
*  the University of Texas and go Longhorns. And I've had three or four people of means, I'll say, [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5178.0s)]
*  you know, people who could afford to go to any college, ask me, do you have any hookups at UT? [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5187.28s)]
*  I want to take a tour. I want to check this out. And I'm like, oh, and they're like, yeah, [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5192.24s)]
*  I just don't want to send my kids to, you know, these as trauma has called them previously on the [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5196.32s)]
*  program woke madrasas. I want to send them to the south to be educated in Texas, or somewhere, [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5201.2s)]
*  you know, where they're not going to learn to be part of Hamas or, you know, Al Qaeda. So there [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5209.12s)]
*  you have it, folks. Send your kids. Yeah, send them to a place that values free speech. Look [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5215.599999999999s)]
*  there first. Look at the fire rating. And then that should tell you everything you need to know. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5221.44s)]
*  It's a it's a huge trend. It's a huge trend that people want to go to these schools. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5226.4s)]
*  Getting back on track. I'll just give a quick shout out as well to Firefly, the Blue Ghost [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5230.96s)]
*  lunar lander landed on March 2 lasted on the lunar surface for 14 days launched on January 15. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5236.16s)]
*  They are launching two additional missions, mission two and mission three mission two is [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5242.639999999999s)]
*  going to launch in 2026 back to the moon 28 for mission three, all of which are doing kind of [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5246.88s)]
*  geologic surveying of the lunar surface. Obviously, the long term goal here is to establish a base. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5253.76s)]
*  Mission five is going directly to your dingleberries. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5264.16s)]
*  They're going to go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You shouldn't have heard that. We're just saying. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5269.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't care. It's our tradition to talk about. I have a 13 year old boy sense of humor. It's fine. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5276.56s)]
*  You do you always have actually would you guys be willing to go to your moon for a week? [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5283.76s)]
*  Would that be something you guys are going to send it? I'm going I talked to my guy. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5290.16s)]
*  100% You got a guy. I'm saying I talked to my guy. He said I could go out with him. So [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5293.84s)]
*  I'm going to have an interest in that. Like, is that something that you'd be motivated to do 100% [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1MAA8y4CgU&t=5299.4400000000005s)]
