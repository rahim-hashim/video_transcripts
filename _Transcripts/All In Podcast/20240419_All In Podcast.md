**All In Podcast:** [April 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI)
*  Tomoff, did you go down to the breakthrough thing this weekend? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=0.0s)]
*  The breakthrough prize was amazing. It's like observing exotic animals in their natural habitat. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3.12s)]
*  Well, a friend of mine who you hung out with down there called me [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=8.24s)]
*  last night to give me the breakdown on all the individuals he saw and what was going on with them. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=11.6s)]
*  I mean, he's like, I don't even know how Nat and I keep getting invited to this, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=16.0s)]
*  but like to say we were outclassed is an understatement. The people at that thing were. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=19.84s)]
*  What is this, the breakthrough prize? Yeah. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=24.16s)]
*  Yeah. I couldn't make it. I got invited to. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  So incredible. Okay. First of all, shout out to Yuri and Julia. It is incredible. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=28.96s)]
*  There were two moments where I cried. This woman goes up on stage to give an award to the people [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=33.52s)]
*  that had made this investment in cystic fibrosis. Yeah. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  And she says, my child was born with cystic fibrosis and then my second child was born with [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  cystic fibrosis and then my second child died. She said that I just burst into tears. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=51.2s)]
*  And then you present an award to the person that actually is helping them [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=57.36s)]
*  stamp out the disease. We celebrated the people that found the gene that caused Parkinson's. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=61.6s)]
*  And then, yeah, I mean, the people at that is pretty incredible. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=66.08s)]
*  It's in LA, right? They did it in Los Angeles. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, like, look, Yuri Milner and Julia Milner, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=72.0s)]
*  Zuck and Priscilla Chan and Anne Wajig and Sergey Brin. Those six people are the ones [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=76.48s)]
*  that organize this breakthrough prize. And I think it's just a modern version of the Nobel [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=82.8s)]
*  which tries to really shine a spotlight on people doing really groundbreaking work in [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  physics and math and life sciences. And so you get people that have just done things that are just [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=93.36s)]
*  very practical and are very real. And I think what they do is they make, frankly, these kinds [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=100.16s)]
*  of achievements much more high level in the sense that you're bringing together people from [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=108.24s)]
*  Hollywood and people from Silicon Valley and the awareness is up and it's just incredibly [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=115.36s)]
*  well produced. And yeah, it's really a cool thing to be a part of. But I mean, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=119.36s)]
*  seeing some of these people are very intimidating. I sat beside Vin Diesel. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=124.63999999999999s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=130.56s)]
*  That was super cool. He is a super nice guy. And on the other side of me was someone that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=131.44s)]
*  Saxon was Toby Emmerich, who was the chairman of Warner Brothers. So just talking to these guys [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=138.32s)]
*  was super cool. Moving it to Los Angeles was a great move. Great idea. Yeah, it's just I was [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=143.6s)]
*  invited. I couldn't make it so sorry. Thank you to Julia and Yuri for inviting us again. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=148.72s)]
*  But it's really great that they're giving it the celebration it deserves and making it, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=154.32s)]
*  you know, like dare I say sexy and cool and hip to be a scientist and solve the world's biggest [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=160.96s)]
*  problems. I think it's just so awesome. And you're right, Sergey Brin, Anne Wojcicki, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=166.96s)]
*  Saken Priscilla and Julia and Yuri are the founders of the Breakthrough Prize. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  The craziest thing is they give a youth Breakthrough Award. So the Breakthrough [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=177.84s)]
*  Prize is this beautiful globe. And then the junior winner gets like a smaller version, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=182.32s)]
*  very appropriate. And it was a video of this kid in India who had won it a few years ago, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=186.96s)]
*  and then went off to MIT and then graduated. And then the video is of him coming back to Bangalore, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=193.36s)]
*  because his sister had won it this year. And he presented to the sister. And all I could think [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=200.96s)]
*  of was this is an incredible achievement by like a 16 year old. And literally at the same time, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=206.88000000000002s)]
*  my 16 year old was like, Dad, the chicken tenders from DoorTash. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=213.84s)]
*  I said, get me the spicy fries, not the regular Cajun fries. The girl that wanted that would [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=222.8s)]
*  freebird did something with Yamanaka factors. So it's like it's really incredible and inspiring. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  But fortunately, don't worry, my 16 year old was able to get the chicken tenders and everything [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=253.12s)]
*  was fine. You can't get his chicken tenders. What do we do? By the way, the other thing I'll say is [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=257.44s)]
*  the person that performed is really amazing, Charlie Puth. And the reason I say it is, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=270.32s)]
*  if you Google Charlie Puth, this guy, he's a young guy in his early 20s, I'm guessing he is so [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=275.04s)]
*  talented. There's all these videos of Charlie Puth where he'll make a random noise, like he'll [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=283.92s)]
*  clink a Coke bottle with a fork. And then he'll record it. And then he'll put it into these [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=288.96s)]
*  digital editing tools. And then he'll make like an entire five minute song using that as the base, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=294.4s)]
*  like as the basic building block. That guy is so talented. Anyways, it was a very it was a very [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=300.8s)]
*  cool event. Fantastic. How are you doing, Sacks? You okay, buddy? I'm good. Let's get started. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=310.0s)]
*  There it is, folks. We're back. Gonna be a hell of a show. Let's go. I got to do. Don't waste time. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=317.44s)]
*  With your pointless banter. That's why people tweet in is the banter. They do. How are you [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=324.08s)]
*  doing? Free break. We got a little scene from the movie her. Wow. We're after a strong start here. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=329.52s)]
*  Look at all these contributions. I got a shrug from freeburg. I got a grunt. Okay, let's get [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=336.88s)]
*  started from Sacks. I don't talk about my background. Let's go. Anything good on the menu [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=342.88s)]
*  tonight? Shemoff. I just want to come in and poke her. I wanted to know if there's an octopus. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=347.2s)]
*  Oh, so the Greek comes back. And you get the octopus. You get the octopus. I think that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=351.35999999999996s)]
*  Sean missed you. Yeah, he did. By the way, Sean experimented with some Greek cheese that you grill. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=356.56s)]
*  That was pretty delicious. That may come back. What's the plural of octopus? Is it octopi? Yeah. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=361.92s)]
*  Aren't they like sentient creatures or something? You know what? It's interesting you bring that up. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=370.32s)]
*  I had a grilled octopus stand at one of our events and somebody who is, you know, a conscientious [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=376.32s)]
*  consumer of calories, lobbied me to take the grilled octopus off of the menu. I wouldn't say [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=385.12s)]
*  whom. For what? Wait, what? I got lobbied very strongly. Not only is it deeply wrong to eat all [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=392.72s)]
*  the animals that you people eat and you will one day realize it or your children or your children's [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=400.64000000000004s)]
*  children will realize it, but octopus in particular have the IQ of four to eight year olds. They can [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  actually sign. They can communicate. They can solve problems. You can watch YouTube videos on [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=411.68s)]
*  this. It's pretty incredible. They're amazing creatures. It's also why in the movie, The Arrival, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=417.44s)]
*  the future alien race is made out to be cephalopods because they're the most [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=422.64s)]
*  advanced creature that's likely to become a civilized form if humans didn't exist. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=427.6s)]
*  I have a one word reaction to that. Yum. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=432.08s)]
*  He's delicious. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=435.92s)]
*  It's delicious. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  Yummy. It's the IQ that makes it taste so good. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=437.6s)]
*  Oh my God. That's dark. That's dark. You're saying the IQ is like the spice? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=441.04s)]
*  Yeah. It's kind of like the fat content, you know, it's kind of like the marbling. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=448.64000000000004s)]
*  It's the marbling. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=452.16s)]
*  It's the marbling of it. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=452.8s)]
*  That's dark. I don't know. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah. By the way, thanks guys. Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah, I'm great. I'm feeling great. Yeah, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=455.76s)]
*  the tooth is healed. I got the implant. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=459.68s)]
*  You look like you've been eating well. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=461.12s)]
*  I just only things with above 120. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=462.08s)]
*  Are you off the Wigovia or what do you call it? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=465.76s)]
*  Well, no, no. You know what I did was I got off the Wigovia so I could eat more animals. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  And now I'm getting back on it because I feel so terrible about how many, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=473.35999999999996s)]
*  I was in Austin. I ate everything. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=478.15999999999997s)]
*  Jake, let me ask you a question. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=479.76s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=481.68s)]
*  If you eat high IQ foods, does it make you smarter? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. This is why the Greeks invented so many things. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=486.71999999999997s)]
*  We invented math, plumbing, cities, democracy. All the great things the Greeks created comes [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=490.4s)]
*  from the fact that we ate so many high IQ creatures. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=496.4s)]
*  Correct. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=498.64s)]
*  Are you able to be vegetarian? Were you able to find good vegetarian or veggie options in Austin? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=499.12s)]
*  Talking to me? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=506.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=507.2s)]
*  I see a vegetable. I push it away. I'm like, wait a second. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=509.67999999999995s)]
*  Jake, I was on a seafood diet in Austin. If he saw food, he ate it. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=514.0s)]
*  Old joke, but. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=518.32s)]
*  It's not inaccurate. The barbecue in Austin is so spectacular. Terry Black's beef ribs [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=520.1600000000001s)]
*  I had with a friend of ours, man, they're just dynamite. And then the salt-lick brisket, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=528.08s)]
*  Franklin's brisket. I mean, it is just extraordinary. Shout out to all my barbecue [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=533.7600000000001s)]
*  folks there and sorry for triggering. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=537.44s)]
*  Every mammal that wasn't buttoned down, Jake held the battered in barbecue sauce and [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=539.2s)]
*  stuck it on grill. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=546.32s)]
*  The thing that took out the rib was the bison. I'm sorry I was away. Apologies to the audience. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=546.8000000000001s)]
*  It took out a tooth. As far as I feel, worth it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=550.5600000000001s)]
*  What does a bison rib taste like? Does it taste like beef? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=553.92s)]
*  Man, the beef ribs are very tender. The bison's got a little more chew to it. It's a little more [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  texture. Yeah. And they let this thing go at the salt-lick for 12 hours and they're just [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=562.16s)]
*  barbecue sauce in it forever. It's a little chewy. And so that's what took out the tooth. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=570.08s)]
*  But great job, Freeberg, on moderating. The episode was fantastic. Yes, I was chomping on [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=575.04s)]
*  the bit quite literally, Sax, to talk about some stuff. Chopping on the bit to the point [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=579.84s)]
*  that I shattered a tooth. But I'm back and I have so much energy. I missed you guys. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=583.6800000000001s)]
*  I actually missed you all. Freeberg, so much good stuff happening with the summit. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=588.0s)]
*  And I'm delighted that John is doing all this work. You're doing all this work. And I can just [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=592.4s)]
*  sit back and enjoy it. So tell us, is there an update on the summit? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=598.32s)]
*  Yeah, you're just collecting your coupon. But yeah, we had within 72 hours, I think we had [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=602.96s)]
*  more applications than we have seats, but we are still leaving applications open. And in the next [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=610.1600000000001s)]
*  week, we'll start to respond to people. So basically, if you're interested in going to the summit, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=615.6800000000001s)]
*  sign up now, get your applications in this week. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=622.24s)]
*  Apply early is the key. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=624.64s)]
*  Yeah, because it's going to be done in order of when it's received. And they're going to start [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=626.5600000000001s)]
*  processing applications this week, we'd love to get everyone that wants to show up show up. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=631.36s)]
*  And if you went in the past, your registration window is wrapped up this week. So [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=636.4s)]
*  it's a real process. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=643.12s)]
*  So I automatically get in. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=643.92s)]
*  Alumni automatically are in. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=645.84s)]
*  Okay. And then tell us about the scholarship because I'm getting bombarded and everybody who's [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=647.36s)]
*  an up and coming all in fan. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  We're going to announce in a couple of weeks. So okay, yeah, we'll still do scholarships, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=653.44s)]
*  because I think they were super successful and helpful to people that otherwise couldn't afford [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=658.4s)]
*  the ticket. I know it's expensive this year. But the reason was we actually spent a lot more per [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=662.0799999999999s)]
*  person last year than people actually pay for their tickets. So it's less than 10. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=666.88s)]
*  So yeah, we're trying to get the price so that we can make make the same break even. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=672.4s)]
*  And we're going to have scholarship tickets with the balance. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=677.1999999999999s)]
*  Great. So should be a couple speakers come in. There's two. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=679.36s)]
*  Not talking about it yet. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=683.28s)]
*  Not talking about it. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=684.16s)]
*  Come on. Just can we just tell the two speakers who said yes, come on. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=684.72s)]
*  Not yet. We'll do a big announcement. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=687.84s)]
*  Sax landed a big speaker. And I think it's going to be awesome. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=690.72s)]
*  In a week. In a week, we'll announce a bunch together. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=693.9200000000001s)]
*  Listen, well, one thing I don't want to wait on is today's docket because it is unbelievable. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=696.24s)]
*  Welcome everybody to episode 175. That's right. It's episode 175 of your favorite podcast and [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=700.0s)]
*  the largest and most listened to podcast in the world. Officially episode 175 of the All In [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=708.0s)]
*  podcast starts right now. And oh, I got so many feelings about this one. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=712.5600000000001s)]
*  Is that the largest most listened to podcast in the world? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=717.2s)]
*  I'm manifesting. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=719.9200000000001s)]
*  Oh, you're manifesting. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=721.36s)]
*  I'm manifesting, Chamath. Just like, just like the world's greatest poker player. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=722.4000000000001s)]
*  And then we watch Robo roll over him. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=727.6800000000001s)]
*  Is that a new word that narcissists use for lying? Manifesting? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=730.1600000000001s)]
*  No, it's just like, you know, the world's greatest poker player. And then we see [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=733.9200000000001s)]
*  Phil Hellmuth get dominated by, by Jason Kuhn. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=737.76s)]
*  Just so you know, tonight is a murderer's row and Hellmuth is flying back. You saw the lineup. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=741.44s)]
*  I'm very excited to see what happens tonight. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=746.88s)]
*  Is Jason Kuhn coming or no? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=748.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=750.56s)]
*  I mean, Kuhn and Robo and then the world's greatest Hellmuth playing is so great to watch. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=751.4399999999999s)]
*  It's like a meta ego battle. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=756.4799999999999s)]
*  It is. And those, you know, it's interesting. Two of those three guys are like the most humble [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=759.1999999999999s)]
*  guys you would ever meet in your life. Am I correct? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=763.1999999999999s)]
*  In your life. Just you could, you could not be more low key and self-effacing than Robo and Kuhn [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=766.88s)]
*  for how good they are. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=771.8399999999999s)]
*  And if you were honestly going to rank the three of them in a high stakes cash game, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=773.4399999999999s)]
*  could you just handicap it for the audience? Because we are in a, we're in a lucky position, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=778.0s)]
*  you and I, to play with these three epic players in the world. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=782.0s)]
*  Break down how they play in a home game, you know, like ours. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=786.64s)]
*  So I would say the most dynamic range would probably be Robo, because Robo has the most [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=792.0s)]
*  experience playing super, super high stakes cash. I think Kuhn is the most precise and [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=801.76s)]
*  like true to GTO. Hard to exploit. I mean, Kuhn is impossible to exploit. Impossible. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=814.96s)]
*  It doesn't tell- [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=820.72s)]
*  No mistakes. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=821.28s)]
*  No mistakes. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=822.4s)]
*  No mistakes. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=823.2s)]
*  Robo knows how to gamble in certain spots. Kuhn knows how to be unexploitable. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=823.92s)]
*  And the third player is Hellmuth. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=828.64s)]
*  And the third person is Hellmuth. And Hellmuth just loses his mind. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=830.96s)]
*  Now the thing with Hellmuth is he's capable, unlike anyone I've ever seen of folding [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=837.28s)]
*  in spots that are, and he's correct, by the way, I've seen Hellmuth fold [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=842.08s)]
*  ace king in spots that none of us would ever do it. I've seen him fold kings in spots that [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=846.16s)]
*  are basically impossible. So Hellmuth is able to get these soul reads on people that I think [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=849.92s)]
*  are amazing. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=856.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=856.64s)]
*  But look, the higher and higher the stakes get, the more and more I think Robo will be [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=857.84s)]
*  comfortable and Kuhn will just go to a playbook that he knows and trusts. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=865.28s)]
*  I am so excited to be back at the game tonight. All right, listen, the docket is so great this [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=870.8s)]
*  week. We got a great classic all-in docket. I want to start with Google firing 28 employees [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=876.88s)]
*  who were involved in this protest at their offices. We didn't think that this would happen. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=882.16s)]
*  We were having a discussion on the group chat on Tuesday, about a dozen employees engaged in [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=886.88s)]
*  sit-ins at the company's offices in Sunnyvale and New York City protesting the conflict [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=891.36s)]
*  in the Middle East between Israel and Palestine. And so they took over, literally took over the [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=898.0s)]
*  offices of the CEO of Google Cloud and nine employees were arrested after refusing to leave. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=904.64s)]
*  The protest was organized by a group called No Tech for Apartheid, and they posted a bunch of [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=910.48s)]
*  clips of this sit-in on X. Those 28 employees were fired on Wednesday after a quick investigation. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=916.08s)]
*  The VP of Global Security was pretty direct and candid. I mean, this is based. They took over [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=924.32s)]
*  office spaces, defaced our property, and physically impeded the work of other Googlers. Behavior like [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=932.16s)]
*  this has no place in our workplace, and we will not tolerate it. If you're one of the few who are [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=938.0s)]
*  tempted to think we're going to overlook conduct that violates our policies, think again. So what [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=943.84s)]
*  were the protests about? Google is involved in a project, Nimbus, a $1.2 billion cloud contract [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=949.2s)]
*  with Israel's government. Both Google and Amazon are involved in the project, which was announced [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=955.2s)]
*  in 2021. Google has denied it was doing work for the military, saying it was working with [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=959.68s)]
*  departments like finance, healthcare, transportation. There's a lot of details to this, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=965.12s)]
*  but let's start with you, Freiburg, since you were a Googler, and we've been talking about the [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=968.88s)]
*  culture of Google, putting aside what the protests were about. How do you feel about protests in the [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=973.12s)]
*  workplace? We've talked about it before here with Coinbase and others. And then is this a distinct [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=980.48s)]
*  change in tone that I'm hearing from Google that they've had enough of social activism at the [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=988.4s)]
*  office? Yeah, there was obviously a line crossed in the view of security, but I think [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=994.8s)]
*  you could look at this two ways. You could look at this as being a culture of entitlement [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1006.24s)]
*  that let folks feel that our employees, that they have permission to stage sit-ins and behaviors [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1012.64s)]
*  like this because Google is so infinitely tolerant and giving employees the space and the [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1019.84s)]
*  room to do whatever they want to do. And all of their wishes and demands can be met and will be [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1027.6000000000001s)]
*  met if they demand it strongly enough. That's one way to look at this and that culture manifested [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1032.24s)]
*  this behavior. Another way to look at it is that these people feel so deeply, strongly, and [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1039.04s)]
*  passionately about the issue at hand that they were willing to risk their jobs and arrest, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1043.44s)]
*  and they cared so deeply about an issue that they think no one's paying enough attention to [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1049.28s)]
*  that they're willing to put themselves and sacrifice themselves for it. So I want to be [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1052.8799999999999s)]
*  empathetic to that point of view as well. But I do think that there's a belief that there may have [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1057.2s)]
*  been this entitlement culture where anytime Google employees ask for stuff, they get it. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1064.24s)]
*  Someone told me the other day how TGIFs at Google now where they do these all-hands and people get [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1070.3999999999999s)]
*  to ask questions. This person is kind of executive level. They're so sick and tired of how every [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1076.08s)]
*  question is all about employees asking for more things that they want. So it's like, when are we [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1081.4399999999998s)]
*  going to get this bonus? When are we going to get this? When are we going to get this? That's so much [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1087.36s)]
*  of the orientation of being an employee at Google is all about what Google can do for me and how I [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1090.96s)]
*  can get more. And that becomes what you ask for. It's like you give a kid something, you give them [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1096.96s)]
*  candy. They're always asked for candy. And I think that there is certainly an element of that [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1101.28s)]
*  culture kind of being frothed up over the years at Google. But I do think that this is an issue that [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1106.08s)]
*  people care very passionately about right now. And you're seeing it all over the place. So [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1112.56s)]
*  certainly not- In the same week, we had the Golden Gate Bridge get shut down. The Bay Bridge [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1117.52s)]
*  gets shut down as well. Chamath, your thoughts on these protests and then obviously the entitlement [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1121.76s)]
*  issues that Freberg alludes to specifically at Alphabet slash Google. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1127.2s)]
*  Chamath There are two separate things and I think it's important to deal with them individually. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1132.32s)]
*  Groups of people in society in a democracy should have a right to protest. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1138.88s)]
*  That's absolutely fundamental and I think they can raise a lot of issues that could otherwise [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1143.76s)]
*  get swept into the carpet. When that stuff impedes the public functioning of society for other people, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1149.2s)]
*  then I think there's a responsibility for law enforcement and other people to act and make sure [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1155.92s)]
*  that that is better managed. So shutting down an entire bridge is not only disruptive, it can be [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1162.88s)]
*  really dangerous. Chamath Of course. And it can hurt your cause because then people dislike the [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1170.96s)]
*  cause because it hurt them. Right. Typically what happens is you're supposed to file for a permit [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1176.16s)]
*  to protest. And when you get that, there are areas that are cordoned off and then people are allowed [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1180.5600000000002s)]
*  to express their views. That's a really healthy form of democracy. Going rogue like this will [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1184.96s)]
*  only blow up in people's faces because the folks that are somewhat sympathetic will eventually get [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1189.6000000000001s)]
*  burned by this experience and turn against them. So that's one set of issues. I think that's just [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1194.5600000000002s)]
*  people going rogue and I think that you can't be tolerant of that kind of chaos. There should be [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1199.5200000000002s)]
*  organized protests, but not disorganized chaos. Law enforcement needs to get a control of that. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1203.7600000000002s)]
*  Inside of a company, I think this is different. It's this weird thing that I see, which is like [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1210.48s)]
*  what I would call like left on left violence. It's like left leaning people creating all of [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1214.16s)]
*  these distractions and demonstrations inside of left leaning organizations for not being left [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1220.0s)]
*  leaning enough. And so it's kind of like a little bit nutty because I think it actually shows how [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1224.48s)]
*  totally naive these employees are and what basic business understanding they have. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1231.8400000000001s)]
*  The first and foremost being that they are at will employees. These are not people that are [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1237.68s)]
*  contracted players in the NBA or are part of a union, okay, where you have guaranteed employment [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1242.64s)]
*  through some mechanism or some arbitration process to even be let go. The fact that you don't even [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1248.64s)]
*  understand that you are at will means that you are there because you want to be there. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1253.92s)]
*  And Google allows you to be there because they choose for you to be there. And at any point, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1257.76s)]
*  if either of you break a covenant, you can be gone. That kind of stuff, I think, is very [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1261.5200000000002s)]
*  distracting and it just belies a poor understanding of what you're there to do. Google is a [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1266.88s)]
*  for-profit business and they are in the business of generating maximum profit on [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1272.88s)]
*  behalf of their shareholders. They are also incentivized to do that in a way that achieves [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1277.2800000000002s)]
*  a mission and a set of values that the majority of their employees agree with. And the fact that [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1282.64s)]
*  a small cohort of people can try to hijack and sabotage that overall direction, I think, is [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1288.96s)]
*  very misguided. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1295.28s)]
*  Sacks, I don't know if you have any opinions on this. I didn't see anything in the docket. I'm [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1299.12s)]
*  not sure if you have any strong feelings here, but your thoughts on Google employees and the [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1302.8799999999999s)]
*  protests, putting aside the nature of the protests. This could be for BLM. This could be for [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1307.6s)]
*  Trump's indictments. You could be protesting any number of things, but the protesting at work issue [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1314.08s)]
*  and then Google specifically, which we talked about with the Gemini issues and [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1319.2s)]
*  you know, this stuff bleeding over into product. I think Freeberg said it really nicely. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1324.32s)]
*  Hey, are people actually focused on products at Google anymore or is the whole place just [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1329.6799999999998s)]
*  focused on social issues that have nothing to do with their waning, apparently, products? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1335.6799999999998s)]
*  Well, Google had no choice but to fire these employees. They were being disruptive and they [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1340.72s)]
*  were trespassing and Google has a business to run. So this is what any business would do. And I [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1346.8799999999999s)]
*  don't think they deserve either credit or blame for taking the action they took. In terms of the [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1351.76s)]
*  protesters themselves, I think that in the fullness of time, we may come to think of them [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1357.04s)]
*  in a slightly different light. And some of this reminds me a little bit of another war, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1365.04s)]
*  the protesters in another war, the Vietnam War, where they were very disruptive. In some cases, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1370.72s)]
*  they trespassed. In some cases, they got arrested. They were easy to make fun of in terms of [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1376.72s)]
*  what they looked like. They were sort of unkempt, unshaven, all the rest of that stuff. They were [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1381.68s)]
*  hippies. And at the time, people were, I'd say, very dismissive of them or actually antagonistic. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1385.92s)]
*  They were seen as giving aid and comfort to the enemy and they were sort of demonized. But now, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1393.76s)]
*  in the fullness of time, we look back on that war and realize that they had a point. In fact, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1398.96s)]
*  maybe they were right. In fact, maybe their actions were justified. And I think that how we [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1403.1200000000001s)]
*  view these protesters at Google can't just be judged now. I think it's going to have to be [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1410.48s)]
*  judged in the fullness of time based on how we perceive this war in Gaza. And I want to make [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1414.0s)]
*  two points about why I think this war will eventually be viewed as Israel's Vietnam. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1418.72s)]
*  The first is that in Gaza, Israel faces a guerrilla-style force and they're in a quagmire. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1424.8s)]
*  And if you read the latest news that's coming out of Gaza, what you'll hear is that after Israel has [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1435.12s)]
*  supposedly cleared an area like Gaza City or Khan Yunis, they then move south. Hamas has popped back [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1442.2399999999998s)]
*  up again. This whole idea that they can clear an area has been proven false. It's like playing [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1449.28s)]
*  whack-a-mole. They basically hit Hamas in one area. Hamas disappears down the tunnels. They come back [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1454.32s)]
*  in a different area. And this is why you're seeing a lot of articles now in Haaretz, which is Israeli [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1459.9199999999998s)]
*  newspaper saying the war in Gaza is already lost. You had the Wall Street Journal last week run an [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1464.4s)]
*  article saying that Israel is winning every battle but losing the war, which is, again, shades of [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1470.0800000000002s)]
*  Vietnam here. And you got to understand, the Wall Street Journal is the most pro-Israel of all the [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1478.96s)]
*  major mainstream publications. I don't think the Wall Street Journal has ever written a truly critical [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1483.92s)]
*  article about Israel. And they described this whack-a-mole dynamic. You also have the general [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1489.36s)]
*  Gadi Eisenkop, who's a member of the war cabinet. He's a member of the sort of war government [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1495.28s)]
*  in Israel, came out and said that we can degrade Hamas in Gaza, but we cannot destroy it. And he [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1502.48s)]
*  said, anyone who's telling you that we can destroy Hamas is telling you a tall tale. And that was, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1508.08s)]
*  I think, an appointed reference to Netanyahu's claim that they would destroy Hamas in Gaza. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1512.8s)]
*  So you've got shades of Vietnam in terms of it being this unwinnable war. I think the second aspect [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1518.4s)]
*  of a similarity to Vietnam is just the huge number of civilian casualties. You recall that in Vietnam, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1524.4s)]
*  the Viet Cong tried to grab us by the belt buckle. They knew that America had superior firepower, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1531.52s)]
*  so they tried to get in close, use ambushes, booby traps, snipers. And in response to that, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1536.24s)]
*  the Americans used immense amounts of firepower and bombing to try and subdue the Vietnamese. And [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1543.2s)]
*  3.4 million Vietnamese were killed in that war, according to Robert McNamara. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1549.8400000000001s)]
*  The second thing that happened is the rules of engagement in Vietnam got extremely loose. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1556.48s)]
*  You took a bunch of scared American kids, many of whom were conscripts. You dropped them in a jungle, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1560.56s)]
*  pretty much because they feared ambushes. They shot anything that moved. And then finally, I think, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1565.68s)]
*  partly to justify this, you had a dehumanization of the Vietnamese that they were seen as somehow [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1570.64s)]
*  subhuman. In any event, if you watch movies about Vietnam, like Platoon, which was made by Oliver [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1578.8000000000002s)]
*  Stone, who was a GI in Vietnam, or if you watch Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece Full Metal Jacket, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1584.5600000000002s)]
*  which was based on books about Vietnam, you can see these dynamics in play very vividly. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1590.96s)]
*  Now turn to Gaza. All you got to do is look at the miles and miles of video to see. It looks like a [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1596.4s)]
*  lunar surface. I mean, even in the words of Joe Biden, there's been indiscriminate bombing there. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1603.44s)]
*  In terms of the rules of engagement, the rules of engagement have gotten very loose. A week or two [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1608.32s)]
*  ago, you had the deaths of those seven aid workers from the International Kitchen Organization. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1613.28s)]
*  And there's an article in Haaretz recently about the kill zones have been set up. Pretty much, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1619.2s)]
*  if you come within a certain invisible perimeter of Israeli troops, you can be shot. I mean, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1623.92s)]
*  those are the rules of engagement. And this is why there were three Israeli hostages who escaped. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1627.8400000000001s)]
*  And they were running towards Israeli troops and yelling in Hebrew, and they still got shot. And [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1633.68s)]
*  again, this goes back to the rules of engagement being very loose. And then the final piece of it [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1638.8s)]
*  is you do have this dehumanization going on of the Palestinians. You can see this in a lot of [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1642.96s)]
*  the videos have been posted by IDF soldiers. So look, I think that these protesters, their actions [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1648.0s)]
*  are going to be judged in the fullness of time. I think there are actually good reasons to believe [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1654.32s)]
*  that Israel's war in Gaza, it's shades of Vietnam. And I think that over the long term, people may [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1661.12s)]
*  regard these protesters in a different light. Right now, they're just seeing as being disruptive [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1667.12s)]
*  and annoying and interfering. But if this war ends up being Israel's Vietnam, which I think it's [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1671.92s)]
*  on track to be, again, I think that people may in time give these protesters a little bit more credit. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1679.1200000000001s)]
*  Jacob, what do you think? Interesting question. Putting aside what they're protesting about, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1685.1200000000001s)]
*  I think they knew, or some number of them knew they were going to get fired. So I think they're [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1691.1200000000001s)]
*  kind of resigning by sit-in. And I think, yeah, there could be nobility to that. If you do not [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1696.88s)]
*  want to participate in supporting things in the world, you do not have to work at Google, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1702.4s)]
*  and you can protest and you can get fired. And we've seen some pretty intense protests. I don't [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1707.92s)]
*  know if you guys are aware of what Greenpeace and other environmentalists did to stop whaling. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1713.44s)]
*  I'm sure you are aware, Friedberg, of your passion on the subject. Those people went to jail in Japan [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1718.16s)]
*  for boarding Japanese whaling ships. Those are really intense protesters. But then to your [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1724.72s)]
*  point, Shamath, you can really hurt your cause. Climate activists have been throwing paint on [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1730.08s)]
*  works of art. I don't know if you've seen that. And that's just infuriating. I have no tolerance [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1736.56s)]
*  for people destroying works of art or attempting to get attention. Here, it is benign to sit in an [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1741.6000000000001s)]
*  office and get fired. So I just consider it resigning by sit-in. If they want to do that, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1748.0s)]
*  that's fine. I do think there is something to Google enabling all this to your point, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1753.04s)]
*  Friedberg, over time. And listen, they were parodied on Silicon Valley, the TV show, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1757.12s)]
*  because of how coddled and entitled people are. So there's a bunch of things going on at the same [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1764.32s)]
*  time. And if you want to do these intense protests, you have the right to do them. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1769.84s)]
*  And history will judge you over time. But you need to be able to pay the price. In this case, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1775.36s)]
*  the price is getting fired. In the case of shutting down the Golden Gate Bridge, you should [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1780.64s)]
*  get a fine for doing that, I believe. And the fine should be based on whatever that costs to shut [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1785.2800000000002s)]
*  that bridge down. And that's got to be a serious fine. And you're right, Shamath. People, if there's [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1789.8400000000001s)]
*  an emergency situation, somebody's got to get to a hospital or something. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1796.16s)]
*  Soterios Johnson That's what I always think about when I see those things, when you block streets [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1799.0400000000002s)]
*  and stuff, or you block airports, or you block these throughways. There's a lot of just normal, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1802.48s)]
*  everyday people trying to live their life who are probably very sympathetic to what you stand for. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1807.52s)]
*  But when you disrupt their everyday lives and or threaten their physical security, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1813.04s)]
*  you're not going to think that that's worth it. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1819.2s)]
*  Aaron Ross I'm also shocked that these people actually [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1820.8s)]
*  came to an office. I mean, these Googlers, I don't think they've actually been to an office before. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1823.8400000000001s)]
*  They probably had to check that their badges were- [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1827.52s)]
*  Soterios Johnson Well, you know, to Sax's point, I actually would have had more respect for these [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1829.1200000000001s)]
*  people if they actually protested the war. But they didn't do that. They had a very discrete, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1834.32s)]
*  specific claim, which was that they wanted to dissolve a business deal that Google had to [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1840.0s)]
*  provide cloud services to the state of Israel called Project Nimbus. And I think that's such [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1846.0s)]
*  a discrete thing that it's hard to understand that those 28 people would have even enough [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1851.76s)]
*  knowledge of what that is. But it sounds like a cloud hosting deal. Well, what's hosted there? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1857.6s)]
*  And it could be any number of things. And I suspect if it's a billion dollar a year deal, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1863.28s)]
*  it's many things. It's probably like the Israeli DMV. Is that really what you want? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1866.96s)]
*  And I think that it would have been much of a more powerful thing to do to protest the actual war, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1871.52s)]
*  if that's what they cared about. Aaron Ross [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1878.3999999999999s)]
*  You know, Dovetail is nicely with the discussion you all had last week about would you back [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1879.76s)]
*  a not a defensive but an offensive weapons company, a technology company. And it seemed like [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1884.8s)]
*  you all had reservations on if you would not back a defensive one, anybody I think reasonably [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1891.76s)]
*  would back a defensive, you know, dome or interception of bombs coming in. That's an easy [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1896.96s)]
*  one. But going around the horn here, how many of us would back a company making missiles, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1902.8799999999999s)]
*  or bombs that blow people up or mines? Would you back a robot that had weapon systems on it? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1910.08s)]
*  I think if you want to summarize what we said last week, it's like, there are all kinds of [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1917.92s)]
*  businesses where you'll end up investing in it. And over time, as it morphs, some of us will be [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1922.32s)]
*  faced with some of those decisions. And it'll, it'll frankly depend on what is the alternative [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1929.28s)]
*  in that moment. So I don't think anybody of us are going into go and build a nuclear bomb. But [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1934.16s)]
*  you should not be naive that if you're building nuclear reactors, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1942.08s)]
*  you could end up being in a situation where that thing gets licensed into a into a thing that you [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1945.12s)]
*  either agree or disagree with. So this is my point is I think that those kinds of answers, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1950.6399999999999s)]
*  or those kinds of questions are missing the nuances. And the nuances are very important. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1955.6799999999998s)]
*  So it's impossible to answer this question in a thoughtful way, I think, would be my my honest [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1962.3999999999999s)]
*  answer. Okay, Sax, any any closing thoughts here? Well, I think Chamath brings up an interesting [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1966.4799999999998s)]
*  point about why didn't the protesters just focus on the war itself rather than Google doing business [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1973.68s)]
*  with Israel? My interpretation of that is they're trying to create a nexus to themselves, meaning [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1979.28s)]
*  they're employees of Google, they're trying to create a reason for them to stage the sit in at [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1984.96s)]
*  Google. Otherwise, you know, if they just grab picket signs, or on the street, it would just be [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1990.0s)]
*  much less newsworthy. So I think they were just trying to create something newsworthy here. And [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1994.72s)]
*  it's kind of worked in the sense that we're talking about it, other people are talking about it. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1999.04s)]
*  So that's my interpretation of that is they were just trying to elevate the issue in a slightly [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2003.52s)]
*  novel way. But look, I think that they should be willing to pay the price of getting fired or [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2010.32s)]
*  getting arrested. I mean, if you're going to engage in that kind of civil disobedience or protest, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2015.44s)]
*  you should be willing to accept the price. And I did see some comments by the Googlers who got [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2020.24s)]
*  fired saying that they thought they're being treated unfairly by Google. I think that's the [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2025.52s)]
*  wrong attitude. I think the attitude is, hey, this cause is so important to me that I'm willing to [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2028.88s)]
*  accept the price of being fired. Saying that you don't deserve to be fired for disrupting [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2034.4s)]
*  the workplace. That is kind of an entitled attitude. So I think they should have just said, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2040.0s)]
*  yeah, we did this on purpose because it's a really important cause. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2044.3200000000002s)]
*  They should say I'm proud to get fired, because that's how much I believe in it. My stock options [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2048.0s)]
*  at Google are less important than this issue to me. And I accept them. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2052.48s)]
*  I think they would have gotten just as much press if they actually protested the war. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2058.64s)]
*  I think in a week from now, everybody will forget what Project Nimbus is. The odds that it gets [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2062.4s)]
*  canceled are less than zero, and everybody will move on. And it will not add to the drumbeat, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2066.8s)]
*  as Sac said, of people that may be eventually on the right side of this issue, theoretically. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2073.2s)]
*  I say theoretically because that stone is still yet to be overturned on that topic. So I think [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2079.2s)]
*  that they missed the mark. And I think that the part of the press that people glommed onto was [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2085.12s)]
*  it was happening inside of a company in real time, and there was video of it. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2091.6s)]
*  Aaron Powell Mission accomplished for them. We're talking about it here as the top story. And [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2094.7999999999997s)]
*  if they wanted to raise awareness, they succeeded, and they should just own their firing because [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2100.48s)]
*  they knew they would get fired, I think. All right. There has been a ton of chaos, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2106.48s)]
*  and the culture wars continue over NPR. A couple of things happened simultaneously this week that [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2110.72s)]
*  are worth discussing. Catherine Maher was named NPR's new CEO back in January. I'm going to have [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2116.7999999999997s)]
*  to give a little bit of a timeline here before I get comments from the boys, because there's a [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2121.9199999999996s)]
*  little setup. And so she was named the CEO back in January. She officially started in March. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2126.9599999999996s)]
*  Okay. She formally worked at Wikimedia Foundation. Those are the people who run [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2133.4399999999996s)]
*  the Wikipedia, obviously. NPR's mission, if you don't know, is to create a more informed [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2137.2s)]
*  public, one challenged and invigorated by a deeper understanding and appreciation of events, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2142.8799999999997s)]
*  ideas, and culture. That's their stated mission from their website. On April 9th, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2148.16s)]
*  Uri Berliner, an editor who's been with NPR for 25 years, wrote an op-ed for Barry Weiss's Free [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2152.16s)]
*  Press from the Pod, explaining how NPR lost America's trust by going hard left and becoming [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2159.2799999999997s)]
*  closed-minded. He said, quote, an open-minded spirit no longer exists within NPR. And now, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2164.4s)]
*  predictably, we don't have an audience that reflects America. Last Friday, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2169.76s)]
*  Maher put out a statement calling his actions profoundly disrespectful, hurtful, and demeaning. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2175.28s)]
*  This Sunday, conservative activist Christopher Ruffo, he's the person who exposed former [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2180.1600000000003s)]
*  Harvard president Claudine Gay's plagiarism. He's a vocal critic of LGBTQ stuff at schools. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2188.2400000000002s)]
*  Started reposting old tweets from Maher, this new CEO. Her tweets are super far left, Trump's a [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2194.8s)]
*  racist, yada yada. There's an interesting clip of her talking at TED, talking about how truth [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2200.64s)]
*  is a bit of a distraction, and that prevents people from getting things done. People have [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2207.12s)]
*  gotten pretty inflamed about that clip. And then on April 16th, Berliner was suspended for five [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2211.76s)]
*  days without pay. Wrapping this all up, Berliner then resigned after 25 years, saying, quote, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2219.6s)]
*  I cannot work in a newsroom where I am disparaged by a new CEO whose divisive views confirm the [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2224.7999999999997s)]
*  very problems that NPR I cite in my Free Press essay. Sax or thoughts? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2232.0s)]
*  – I mean, this just seems like a dog bites man story. I mean, what is the novel revelation here? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2237.44s)]
*  The person running NPR is a liberal? I mean... [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2243.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm kind of with you, but... [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2247.36s)]
*  – What took 25 years to resign? I mean, all you have to do is listen to NPR. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2248.56s)]
*  It's always been liberal, okay? This is not some recent capture of an institution by the left. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2252.24s)]
*  – So why is it going so crazy viral right now? Why has this become the topic of the moment? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2258.0s)]
*  – Well, apparently there are some quotes that this new CEO, Catherine Marp, tweeted or said that you [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2263.36s)]
*  can point to that seem kind of woke and kind of crazy woke, but they're just actually pretty [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2271.2s)]
*  standard. I just don't see the breaking news here. If they end up firing Catherine Marr, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2278.24s)]
*  they're going to hire someone just like her. I mean, they're going to have the same views. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2283.52s)]
*  NPR has always been left of center, and the only change that's happened is that the left has now [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2287.12s)]
*  become woke. And so it's become obsessively focused with the ideas of white supremacy and [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2294.56s)]
*  white privilege. And she simply reflects that. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2302.16s)]
*  – I agree. It's like a tempest in a teapot. Like, newsflash. NPR is woke and left leaning. I mean, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2305.52s)]
*  I guess maybe that somebody who was there for 25 years wrote the expose is interesting or, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2312.64s)]
*  I don't know, Chamath, any thoughts on this one and why it's taking up so much headspace for people? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2318.16s)]
*  – I don't think it is. I think it's taking up a lot of headspace amongst breathless journalists. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2322.72s)]
*  I don't think it matters to the public at large. I don't think anybody cares. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2328.08s)]
*  – I just had one thing, which is I do think that the government should not be funding this [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2331.12s)]
*  anymore. I think NPR at this point is mostly funded by private donations, but it got started [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2335.44s)]
*  with government money and the government still funds it. And given that it is this left institution [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2340.72s)]
*  at this point, and really always has been, there's simply no reason for the government [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2347.68s)]
*  to be funding one side of the political debate that way. So I think there is maybe an issue [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2352.4s)]
*  there in terms of reminding people that, hey, this is like government funded. Why? And there's [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2357.92s)]
*  no reason why NPR can't be funded with either private donations or private subscription dues. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2363.36s)]
*  – Yeah, this is just to give people some back of the envelope math. NPR's budget is like $320 [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2369.12s)]
*  million. It's a dollar per American. And they get a bunch of programming fees and some corporate [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2374.08s)]
*  sponsorship. Corporate sponsorship is like $100 million. The programming fees is what the local [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2379.6800000000003s)]
*  radio stations pay them. Net-net, this is costing maybe, I don't know, $0.30 an American. And if [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2384.08s)]
*  you just swap out – and this is the way I like to look at these to be objective – if you were [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2391.68s)]
*  saying this was funding Fox News or, I don't know, Ben Shapiro and Daily Wire, how would you feel [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2395.2799999999997s)]
*  about it? You'd be like, well, why is the government funding that? They should just cut NPR and all [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2400.88s)]
*  this public broadcasting stuff loose over the next year or two, wind it down, and let them fend for [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2404.64s)]
*  themselves in the new media landscape. – Look, Jake, I agree with you. They could easily substack [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2409.84s)]
*  it. NPR's not going to go away. Just create subscriptions and you're fine. – Yeah. I mean, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2413.36s)]
*  it's only like they're down to whatever. It's very hard to find the numbers. There's a little [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2418.2400000000002s)]
*  like hiding of the money here. But there's so little at stake here. I think that's why it's [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2422.32s)]
*  so contentious. Nobody cares. – The government should not be funding one-sided ideological [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2426.32s)]
*  institutions on either side of the political debate. And you're right. If this was funding going to [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2430.48s)]
*  Daily Wire or something like that, people would be up in arms. So in any event, what's good for the [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2436.2400000000002s)]
*  gander? – The next tempest in a teapot is Humane's AI pin getting barbecued by our modern-day [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2441.76s)]
*  Walt Mossberg, Marques Brownlee, who is an awesome YouTuber. I love his reviews. And it's created a [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2448.96s)]
*  bit of a social media raw shock test here, getting a lot of feels from people in Silicon Valley. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2454.8s)]
*  Let's just tee this up here. Humane is a hardware startup that you may have heard of. They make an [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2460.48s)]
*  AI-powered wearable computer. It's basically a pin you put on your chest. It's about the size of a [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2465.2000000000003s)]
*  pack of cigarettes, maybe half the size of it. It was founded by two Apple execs back in 2018. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2470.4s)]
*  It raised a quarter of a billion dollars or so. And the device is now in the hands of reviewers. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2475.36s)]
*  It's pretty innovative. And Marques talks about how innovative it is in his review. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2482.7200000000003s)]
*  It will let you talk to it. It's got a camera on it. We'll show it here on the screen. If you're [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2487.6s)]
*  not subscribed to the YouTube channel, just go to YouTube right now and you'll see us playing the [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2492.1600000000003s)]
*  video of it. Search for Fall In. And really interesting interface. It does obviously voice. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2496.8s)]
*  It connects you to an LLM on the back end. So if you want to know some piece of information, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2503.36s)]
*  it can answer those questions for you. But Marques showed it just absolutely failing at a bunch of [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2508.88s)]
*  tests, being overpriced. And he called it the worst product he's ever reviewed. He's very thoughtful [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2515.52s)]
*  and methodical, but the title is obviously a bit link baiting. As a co-founder of Engager, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2523.68s)]
*  I can tell you if you want to get a lot of clicks to say something is the best or the worst ever, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2530.08s)]
*  and you can get 10 times the views. The pin, according to him, doesn't do anything better [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2534.16s)]
*  than a smartphone. It's slow. It doesn't work. It's often wrong. It's 700 bucks. The battery sucks. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2542.72s)]
*  So many different ways to go with this. Everybody is talking about it on X and in the media. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2549.68s)]
*  Where do you stand on this one, Friedberg? Both on how people are responding to it in the tech [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2557.4399999999996s)]
*  industry as being like anti-tech, anti-innovation versus, hey, it's just a reviewer giving his [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2564.48s)]
*  candid feedback on a product that's clearly not ready for prime time. I think there's a lot of [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2570.3999999999996s)]
*  issues. One is just the challenge of deep tech, more specifically in this case, hardware investing. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2575.6s)]
*  You have to invest a lot of capital before you even have your first product. And then you don't [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2584.08s)]
*  really know how well it works until you've already burned through a lot of capital. I mean, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2589.52s)]
*  this is one of the stunning stories of a startup that has raised a quarter billion dollars. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2594.0s)]
*  And then they come out with their first product and it turns out it needs a lot of work [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2599.2s)]
*  because it doesn't do anything that consumers really are compelled by as evidenced by the review. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2603.12s)]
*  So I think it highlights that challenge and why that market finds, particularly in this [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2610.08s)]
*  environment, it to be so hard to get capitalized. Now, obviously there are some entrepreneurs like [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2616.8s)]
*  Elon who can take that capital and drive to the outcome, spending hundreds of millions of dollars [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2622.88s)]
*  before you get your first rocket into space and you have a lot of failings along the way. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2630.88s)]
*  But the general tone here is a deep tech investment is very likely to fail because you spend so much [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2636.2400000000002s)]
*  money before you even know. And at that point you have less money and you can't really make the [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2643.6800000000003s)]
*  necessary iteration to get there. So it's a tough data point for other deep tech companies that need [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2647.36s)]
*  to raise a lot of capital. Then I think it brings up the point about ex Apple people, that there's [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2654.88s)]
*  a degree of confidence because people come from Apple and a degree of hubris in the employees that [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2660.32s)]
*  come from Apple that says, I have worked at the best hardware company in the world. Therefore, [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2665.92s)]
*  this person is likely to succeed. It turns out that when you don't have all that built in [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2670.88s)]
*  infrastructure for testing and optimization, all of that built in distribution, all of the feedback [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2674.4s)]
*  systems that Apple has engineered into their business model for so long, maybe you miss some [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2679.92s)]
*  of the data around what makes a product great or not before you launch. I think that's your key [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2684.6400000000003s)]
*  point. Freeburg, that is the best point is these folks come from Apple, they're used to unlimited [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2689.28s)]
*  resources. And what you don't see is all the product Apple doesn't release, right? They never [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2694.32s)]
*  release their car, correct? Freeburg and they get to, I think, I think then there's also this [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2700.0s)]
*  question about like, where is the value in the product? Because they thought, hey, if we have AI [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2704.0s)]
*  on a pin, it'll work without the consumer feedback about whether or not people are willing to sit [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2709.84s)]
*  around and wait for 12 seconds to get an answer to a question. And then it brings up this other [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2715.68s)]
*  really important point, which is half the people in Silicon Valley are running breathlessly into [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2721.44s)]
*  the conversation saying, do not disparage a startup that's working really hard at getting [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2725.44s)]
*  their first product right. It'll destroy the motivation of other startups that need to kind [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2730.0s)]
*  of iterate to get there. And we can't just take the first V1 and say that's it. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2734.16s)]
*  Chmoth, your thoughts? You're laughing hysterical at this. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2739.92s)]
*  The other half of Silicon Valley are running in and saying this thing's a piece of s***. What [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2743.52s)]
*  are you talking about? It doesn't work. So it is a really interesting kind of, you know, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2746.24s)]
*  debate. Yeah, word shock test on what's going on. What do you see in this inkblot of a product? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2751.52s)]
*  Neither of those two cohorts. I think that incredibly motivated, dedicated entrepreneurs [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2758.88s)]
*  don't even know that this is happening and don't care. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2765.12s)]
*  Got it. In other words, the reviewers are going to review products and you just got to plow ahead [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2768.08s)]
*  and make a better product. The idea that in 2009, 10 or 11, right, that when all the rockets weren't [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2773.7599999999998s)]
*  working, you know, and Elon was back against the wall, that he was reading TechCrunch or getting [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2782.7999999999997s)]
*  upset because a product failed some other random product that had nothing to do with his. I [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2789.4399999999996s)]
*  think is laughable. I think no great entrepreneur cares. I don't think Freeberg is going to change [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2794.16s)]
*  what's happening at Ohalo based on what is this thing called? Humane. Right. Freeberg, have you [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2799.2s)]
*  changed? Have you made decisions? Are you sadder today in Ohalo when you walked into the office [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2807.2799999999997s)]
*  to manage your team? No. Okay, so there you go. There's your answer. Not a big matter. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2811.2799999999997s)]
*  Sax, your feeling on this? Yeah, I mean, I'm having a hard time [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2814.56s)]
*  understanding all the controversies this week. I mean, reviewers are going to review, protesters [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2817.04s)]
*  are going to protest and the NPR presidents are going to NPR. Here we go. What's going on? [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2821.92s)]
*  Everyone's just doing what they're doing their job. Yeah. Here's an idea for the humane team. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2827.6s)]
*  Be thankful somebody took the time to review your product and give you candid feedback and [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2832.2400000000002s)]
*  incorporate it back into your product and make it work. An irreverent elitist will eat octopus. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2837.04s)]
*  Here we are. Absolutely. So delicious. So delicious. High IQ foods. We should create [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2843.28s)]
*  a new category. High IQ foods. Yeah, what are the other high IQ foods? Acorn fed beef. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2847.04s)]
*  Yes. For sure high IQ. Pigs, very high IQ. I saw that cow playing chess before he was served for [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2854.0s)]
*  dinner. I was having a pulled pork sandwich from Bucky's and it helped me solve Wurdle for the day [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2860.72s)]
*  before I ate it. So I got Wurdle in two tries. Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't want that one to land. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2868.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, okay, let me ask this question. Do we think the world, let's say this thing did respond. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2879.92s)]
*  Here's the theme. Here's the theme, Jason. Here's the theme, Jason. The problem is that I think [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2885.84s)]
*  people right now, the real Rorschach test is if you are so easily distracted, you probably don't [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2890.0800000000004s)]
*  have enough to do. Right. That's the entitlement is that you don't have enough work on your plate. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2897.04s)]
*  I don't want to call it entitlement. But I think the reality is that if you get caught up in all [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2902.56s)]
*  of these silly little fake battles or decisions, I think what it really means is that you're not [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2907.44s)]
*  busy enough and or you're not working on something that matters enough to you. Because when either [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2913.36s)]
*  of those two things are true, people tend to be tend to have blinders on and they are super focused. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2917.92s)]
*  And they just don't have an opinion. They don't care. Like, honestly, many of these topics today, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2923.84s)]
*  I really don't care. And it's not because I'm better or worse or smarter or dumber. It's because [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2928.32s)]
*  I'm so overworked right now. I don't have time to have an opinion on this stuff. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2932.2400000000002s)]
*  Trayvon's got a CEO job and now he's got to work. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2936.32s)]
*  No, but and I think that anybody else trying to do their job well is probably in the same category. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2938.88s)]
*  I hadn't even heard of this reviewer. What's his name? Mark, Mark, Mark, Marquez Brownlee. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2944.2400000000002s)]
*  I never heard of him. If you're on YouTube, he's kind of like [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2950.08s)]
*  the new Walt Mossberg. He does 20, 30 minute videos. They get millions of views. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2952.88s)]
*  He's huge. I don't know that he makes or breaks a product, though, by the way. He does not make or [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2958.6400000000003s)]
*  break a product. The product makes or breaks itself. Yeah. Look, when I was running companies, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2963.84s)]
*  I wouldn't care about what one reviewer said. I would care about the totality of the reaction [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2968.7200000000003s)]
*  to the product, which would include customers as well as reviewers and so forth. So I don't think [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2973.6s)]
*  there's any point getting too bad out of shape about one review. I think what's kind of happening [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2979.6s)]
*  in terms of the reaction here is that people want to give this company mercy points for being [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2983.8399999999997s)]
*  innovative. So my guess is the product just isn't ready for prime time, but everyone wants to kind [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2991.12s)]
*  of like they want their viewers to take it easy on them or something because they are being [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=2995.52s)]
*  innovative and they're breaking new ground in this area of wearables. But the reality is in the real [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3000.88s)]
*  world where you want to charge people for your product, like customers don't have mercy points. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3006.08s)]
*  Nope. So if the car breaks down, the car breaks down. And by the way, Marquez got a little bit [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3012.3199999999997s)]
*  of heat just a month ago because he reviewed the Fisker. The Fisker is just a piece of garbage [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3018.0s)]
*  car. He said it's the worst car he's ever reviewed. And you know what? Reviewers exist in the world [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3022.88s)]
*  to inform customers about what products and services they should buy. And then they should [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3028.96s)]
*  inform you to make a better product period, full stop. There is an easy solution to this, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3033.12s)]
*  by the way, which Apple did. They released the Vision Pro as a developer kit. They put a bunch [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3037.7599999999998s)]
*  of caveats on it and said, Hey, we understand this is high priced. It's a developer kit. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3044.08s)]
*  This is in beta. What Humane should have done is they should have said this is the humane [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3049.2799999999997s)]
*  beta for developers. I still don't know what it is. What is this? Okay. It's a wearable. It's a [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3053.6s)]
*  square. It has a projector on it. You put your hand out, it projects a little screen that shows [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3058.96s)]
*  you like a computer screen and you can talk to it. Yeah. The primary function is like a chat [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3064.48s)]
*  AI assistant that sits on you and has a camera. And so you can say it's taping everything that [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3070.96s)]
*  it sees. It doesn't do that by default, but it could, but sorry, let me just give the quick [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3077.36s)]
*  overview. And basically you ask it questions and it can go get the answers. The problem is [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3082.32s)]
*  that it has to go make a request to the internet, run an AI model and come back. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3087.3599999999997s)]
*  So it takes like 12 seconds to get results. Most of the time, according to the reviewer, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3091.8399999999997s)]
*  the results are actually wrong because it's a model. The voice to text translation is wrong. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3096.08s)]
*  There's a lot of things that are wrong about it. So it takes a long time. It's clunky. And then [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3102.08s)]
*  the battery burns out every two hours and it gets super hot because of the way they get it to [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3105.68s)]
*  magnetically stick to your clothes. So it gets very hot. So there's also an issue and it's 700 [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3109.68s)]
*  bucks. Other than that, how is the play Mrs. Lincoln? And by the way, most importantly to you, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3114.64s)]
*  Chamath, it will screw up your fabrics. If you wear this with a Loro Piana sweater, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3120.0s)]
*  it's going to drag your sweater down. Hold on. I was just thinking this. You would never attach [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3124.16s)]
*  it to a $6,000 sweater. Yeah. It's basically what you're telling me is it's an overpriced device [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3127.12s)]
*  that could give you first degree burns and it will ruin your sweaters. It doesn't answer the [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3133.3599999999997s)]
*  questions that you asked. Yeah. But then, but then do I think the questions or do I have to say it [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3138.7999999999997s)]
*  out loud so it looks like I'm talking to myself? You look like a lunatic. Yes. You're walking [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3143.6s)]
*  around like a crazy person talking to yourself. That was the other thing he said is like when [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3147.52s)]
*  you're in a crowd and there's a voice around, you can use your hand and hand gestures to control it [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3150.72s)]
*  and do things with the projector thing that it does. And it damages your clothes. It's some really [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3155.68s)]
*  cool, interesting features. It's just like, it's not quite there yet. Who invested in it? Let's [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3159.7599999999998s)]
*  not make fun of it. Let's make fun of the investors. Who invested in it? Sam Altman. Shout out to Sam. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3163.44s)]
*  It's coming out of the program. I think. Yeah. Listen, I, I, the concept I think is good. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3169.12s)]
*  Wearables are going to provide some distinct values when they work because you don't have to [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3175.2799999999997s)]
*  take your phone out. And so the idea behind wearables, like your watch is, you know, like [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3180.4s)]
*  there are some things I do on my watch now where I don't take my phone out. I have the other side [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3185.2s)]
*  of this. I'll take the other side when you're done. Yeah. I use Fitbit company we invested in [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3189.8399999999997s)]
*  and it puts all my workouts on my watch. When I'm doing weights, I started doing weights now. That's [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3194.64s)]
*  why I look so buff folks subscribe to the YouTube channel to say, and I do my sets and I log them all [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3198.48s)]
*  with my, my watch. I don't have to take my phone out. That's like the first thing. And then when [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3204.32s)]
*  I'm skiing, I can see each one. I showed you slopes. I'm not an investor in Chamath where I could see [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3208.16s)]
*  my speed and all that stuff. You're saying something totally different. That's, that's utility. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3213.2s)]
*  Of course you'll find a device will give you utility. I thought you were saying something [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3217.44s)]
*  else, which is everybody's going to have wearables and I want to take the exact opposite side. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3221.84s)]
*  I don't know that everybody will have wearables, but I do find a couple of little things that work [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3227.04s)]
*  for me. I totally get that, you know, the use of an accelerometer or whatever in a watch or in a band [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3231.04s)]
*  that you wear on your wrist for a workout. And I think that that's valuable or heart rate, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3236.24s)]
*  a glycemic monitor so that you could all of that stuff makes super sense for you as an individual, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3241.3599999999997s)]
*  but that's not an experience where you're engaging with it to sub like to, to replace some other [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3245.7599999999998s)]
*  social interaction. That's just you getting utility as you live your life. What I'm saying [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3253.76s)]
*  is the idea that you start to rely on a device as your interface into the world. I would take the [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3257.76s)]
*  exact other side of the bat, which is I think that humans are getting so sick and tired of being, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3264.48s)]
*  of only communicating in these very rigid ways. Like I'm telling you, like if you look at our [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3272.1600000000003s)]
*  children's generation, they don't know how to make eye contact. They don't know how to talk. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3277.92s)]
*  And I think it's going to come back and bite them in the ass. And so I think the pendulum is going [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3282.0s)]
*  to swing in the other direction where it's like, okay, enough of this stuff. Let's actually look [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3286.4s)]
*  each other in the eye and talk to each other the way that humans were meant to be. And I, and I [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3291.04s)]
*  think that in that devices like a glucose monitor or a band has value, but I don't think it's going [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3294.96s)]
*  to be this interface where you're sign languaging it while you're at Coachella. I think you're going [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3301.28s)]
*  to rip the devices off and actually be at Coachella without any devices. Did any of you guys read [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3305.28s)]
*  Jonathan Haidt's book, anxious generation? It is unbelievably awesome. It touches on all. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3309.68s)]
*  Not right yet. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3314.48s)]
*  I stop what you're doing and just listen to the audio book on your walks on audible. This book [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3315.04s)]
*  is super important and awesome. The anxious generation by Jonathan Haidt. I cannot tell you [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3320.08s)]
*  how important it is. Sax, any closing feelings here? You have a take? Any hot takes? [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3325.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, I would slightly disagree with you guys about this device. So first of all, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3328.96s)]
*  I think that humans are becoming more and more cybernetic. We're getting more and more immersed [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3334.56s)]
*  with computing power and I agree. It creates this anxiety and all these problems. But on the other [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3338.48s)]
*  hand, I think it's an irreversible trend. So I think that I would not bet against things that [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3343.36s)]
*  make us more cybernetic. I think the problem here is that this company is trying to do two difficult [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3348.32s)]
*  things. The first thing is it's trying to capture everything that's happening in the world around [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3353.84s)]
*  you to feed it into an AI model so it can make you smarter. The other thing is trying to do is [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3358.4s)]
*  reduce your dependence on your phone by creating this new projection surface. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3363.68s)]
*  In my experience, when you try to do two hard things, you actually square the complexity [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3370.24s)]
*  and you square the difficulty as opposed to just adding it. So I think of these two things, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3375.12s)]
*  the one that sounds interesting to me is taking in all the information from the physical world [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3379.6s)]
*  and putting it in an AI model that can be helpful to you. But I see no reason to replace the phone. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3384.16s)]
*  I think it should just work with your phone. The problem they're going to have is that that pendant [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3389.04s)]
*  will compete with the Apple glasses and all the other wearables that are going to be created to [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3393.92s)]
*  suck in all this information, this computer vision from the world. Nonetheless, I do think [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3399.6s)]
*  that is the opportunity. It's not replacing the phone. It's layering a new platform on top of the [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3405.36s)]
*  phone that can kind of, again, give you that Terminator mode in the real world. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3410.72s)]
*  And that was a complaint about this device specifically was that it was detached from the [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3416.16s)]
*  phone. I understand why they want to make it standalone, but, and then this opens up all the [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3419.84s)]
*  privacy. Let me ask the panel here, what do you think about this concept of recording the entire [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3423.92s)]
*  world, all these conversations and video with these devices? I think it's a quick way to get [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3429.92s)]
*  yourself punched in the face. I mean, we saw that with Google Glass. People showed up at bars in [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3434.16s)]
*  San Francisco and parties with these Google Glass things on and literally got punched in the face. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3438.88s)]
*  Well, this is why privacy things recording your entire life with a pendant, man. No, thank you. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3443.84s)]
*  This is why I said what I said. I do think Sachs is right that ultimately [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3448.7200000000003s)]
*  you'll have some kind of brain interface because I do think a chip implant of some kind is very [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3452.8s)]
*  valuable. But what I'm also saying is that I think that that will actually lessen the social [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3458.0s)]
*  acceptability of these visible devices that are constantly getting in between you and another [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3464.88s)]
*  person. And so the idea that we're kind of already in a quasi surveillance state and now we're going [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3470.16s)]
*  to increase that by N factorial to the number of people, I think is very depressing. It is depressing. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3475.44s)]
*  And you know what? In Jonathan Haidt's book, he talks about phone lockers for schools and the [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3482.64s)]
*  transformative power they have had. When you go to a school, there are some schools now, high schools, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3488.0s)]
*  where the students put their phones in specific phone lockers. They do it in my kids. It's actually [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3492.7999999999997s)]
*  Jason, these special pouches. Yeah, those are the pouches comedians use like Chappelle at his shows. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3497.6s)]
*  Chappelle uses it. Kevin uses them. Yeah, exactly. And they're great. And then what the school now [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3503.7599999999998s)]
*  also teaches the kids, at least our school, which I found really interesting is the graduated form [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3510.16s)]
*  of that is they actually now allow you to put it in a envelope because they're training the kid. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3515.2799999999997s)]
*  Like the pouch you can't get access to. You have to go back to the locks. It locks and unlock device. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3520.7999999999997s)]
*  And then I saw that my son last week had it actually in a white envelope and he had to close [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3525.84s)]
*  the envelope and just keep it with him as like a way of graduating from the prison form of [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3530.88s)]
*  keeping the phone away to like, you know, having it in your pocket. So the schools are trying to [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3537.52s)]
*  do a lot to try to teach these kids not to be so dependent on. They should ban these devices at [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3541.04s)]
*  schools 100%. And then at the poker game tonight, we should meet people, stack their phones and [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3544.56s)]
*  charge somebody $1,000. Whoever takes the phone first, let's do it tonight. Let me give a shout [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3548.64s)]
*  out to one of my favorite sci-fi book series is called Nexus by Ramazanam. And it's kind of this [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3554.72s)]
*  like cyber futuristic series. But what he talks about is when we have this brain computer interface, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3560.0s)]
*  you'll be able to upload your memories. And so you talk about this idea of recording your whole [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3567.4399999999996s)]
*  life through a pendant. Well, eventually you'll be able to record your whole life based on just [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3572.56s)]
*  through your eyeballs. And you'd be able to upload in theory a first person view of whatever [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3577.04s)]
*  conversation you've been in, you know? And so there's a certain, look, this is pretty far off, [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3584.56s)]
*  but there is maybe a certain inevitability to that. And we're gonna have to figure out how to [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3589.44s)]
*  deal with the privacy implications. There was a Black Mirror episode on this exact idea. Yep. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3594.24s)]
*  Yeah. You have the DVR of your entire life. Yeah. And it is gnarly to think these things will exist. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3598.96s)]
*  And I think humanity is going to have to make a decision, I think, to fight this or embrace it. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3604.16s)]
*  I think we should fight it. I think it's going to ruin like social existence. And it's already [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3608.32s)]
*  ruined poker games, et cetera, when everybody's on their phone. It's ruined dinner parties when [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3613.76s)]
*  everybody's on their phones. The constant distraction is just horrific. And it's having [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3616.96s)]
*  a horrible impact on this generation. I'll double down on what you're saying. It is so lovely to be [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3621.5200000000004s)]
*  able to have a dinner where everybody just talks to each other and looks each other in the eyes. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3625.92s)]
*  Yes. And then when you have a handful of people always on their phone, it's depressing. It's [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3629.6000000000004s)]
*  actually not even neutral. It's a net negative and a drag on the entire night. Absolutely. I am trying [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3636.0800000000004s)]
*  to come up with ways to remove these devices from the social settings. I've been to a couple [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3642.48s)]
*  of parties with high profile people where they have everybody check their phones at the door. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3647.28s)]
*  I got to say, those are the best nights of my life. Those are the best nights. They're incredible. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3652.48s)]
*  And no offense to people who are addicted to their phones. I am to a certain extent. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3656.0s)]
*  I put my social media at one hour on my phone. My Lord, it is hard to do less than an hour of [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3660.2400000000002s)]
*  social media in our job positions. I deleted TikTok about a month ago. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3665.84s)]
*  It's been liberating. I was a slave to that app. I couldn't believe how much TikTok I was consuming [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3672.72s)]
*  after it was gone because I couldn't find anything to replace it. And then I stumbled into the fact [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3680.2400000000002s)]
*  that YouTube has YouTube shorts and there is a lot of that content, but it's terrible and the [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3685.28s)]
*  algorithm is really bad. And so fortunately, I just stopped using YouTube. It just shows you how [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3689.52s)]
*  the algorithm is such a key component of that TikTok experience because I had the same experience [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3696.2400000000002s)]
*  shorts serves up garbage, Instagram show serves up garbage. And then TikTok is just like right into [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3702.0s)]
*  your brain. Kicks ass. It kicks ass. I won't give it another shot. I miss TikTok. TikTok. I miss you. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3709.2s)]
*  Yeah, whatever. It's that's going away. I miss you. Another incredible book. I think we should [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3715.84s)]
*  book this speaker for all in summit, Bad Therapy, Why the Kids Aren't Growing Up, Abigail Schreier. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3720.0s)]
*  This book is incredible. And if you read these two, every parent, read these two books, and we need [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3727.36s)]
*  to have a conversation on it as parents here. Everybody read these two books. These two, these [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3733.52s)]
*  are my two top choices for the all in summit. I think it's like the going to be the topic of our [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3738.0800000000004s)]
*  time. All right, let's keep going down this incredible docket. Very important issue for us [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3743.44s)]
*  to talk about. Silicon Valley startups having a bit of a R&D tax problem. Thanks for putting it [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3747.28s)]
*  on the docket here, Freeberg. It's a bit inside baseball, but very important topic. Let's say [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3753.68s)]
*  a company like Acme Corporation generated a million bucks in revenue, and they spent a million bucks [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3758.8799999999997s)]
*  on their software developers last year. Let's say they had, I don't know, five developers getting [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3763.3599999999997s)]
*  paid 200 grand each. Well, traditionally, this company would pay nothing in income tax, right? [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3767.04s)]
*  They spent a million, they deduct that million from the million dollars in revenue that came in, [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3771.2s)]
*  and everything's good. But due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, starting last year, a provision [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3775.92s)]
*  kicked in, forcing companies to amortize their R&D expense over five years. So in this hypothetical [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3784.6400000000003s)]
*  situation, the Acme Corporation would amortize 200K a year and pay income tax on the 800K in profits. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3790.4s)]
*  This is brutal, obviously, for a startup. Profits, air quotes. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3797.84s)]
*  Air quotes, profits, correct. And this is absolutely brutal. And a lot of companies took [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3800.88s)]
*  a wait and see approach as hoping Congress would fix the issue in January, a bipartisan tax bill [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3806.72s)]
*  that would reverse its changes passed in the House. But the bill has stalled in the Senate, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3811.52s)]
*  and we got to get this thing fixed because it's going to sink a lot of startups. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3815.84s)]
*  Maybe people will start putting their companies in other countries, [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3819.2s)]
*  but it's attached to this child tax credit, which Republicans don't want to pass. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3823.52s)]
*  Sort of no reversal has happened. Freberg, you highlighted this for us. Very important topic. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3827.68s)]
*  Thank you for doing so. As our great contributor here, what are your thoughts on it? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3831.44s)]
*  This became law in the 2017 Jobs Act, as you highlighted. And basically, it means that [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3839.04s)]
*  companies, not just like tech companies, but life sciences companies, defense companies, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3846.24s)]
*  are pushing Congress to change this law because you can't actually deduct the expenses that you [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3852.0s)]
*  use to run your business. You have to only deduct them over five years, 20% a year. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3858.8s)]
*  So like you pointed out, if you're making a million dollars, but you're spending a million dollars, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3864.16s)]
*  you made no profit, but you got to pay taxes as if you made 800 grand in profit. And a lot of these [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3867.52s)]
*  small companies don't have that cat. So venture capital-backed companies and public companies [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3872.72s)]
*  that are profitable, they can afford to do this because they have large balance sheets. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3877.84s)]
*  So it doesn't affect them as much as it does the literally hundreds of thousands of small [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3881.36s)]
*  businesses that work in the life sciences sector, the defense sector, the tech sector [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3887.28s)]
*  that are struggling this year to make the tax payments that are required under this law that [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3891.52s)]
*  went into effect last year. And Congress promised that they were going to repeal this law leading [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3897.6000000000004s)]
*  up to April 15th, which happens obviously a few days ago and make it retroactive to 2023, [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3902.56s)]
*  but they didn't. But Freeburg, they know basic math. Congress knows basic math. How do they, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3908.32s)]
*  how do they- What was the intent here? Yeah. So the original intent was that this was one of the [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3913.2s)]
*  ways, you guys know, whenever you pass a bill, it gets run through the OMB and the CDF that figures [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3919.68s)]
*  out what's the budgetary cost of the bill. And one of the ways that they made this work, this bill, [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3925.2s)]
*  the 2017 Trump Tax and Jobs Act, you guys may remember in that bill, they also made it impossible [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3930.32s)]
*  to deduct entertainment and dining expenses when you take people out to dinner anymore. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3935.28s)]
*  That sucks. And they did all those things to make up some of the money they were using for basic [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3939.36s)]
*  general tax breaks for companies. So they use this as a way to say like, look, in a couple of years, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3944.2400000000002s)]
*  we're going to kick in this R&D expenditure thing and it'll trigger a lot more revenue for the [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3949.52s)]
*  federal government. It'll create a lot more taxes and a lot more revenue. So that was the idea. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3954.32s)]
*  And everyone was like, yeah, okay, sure. We'll do that. Great. It makes the accounting work. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3958.88s)]
*  And then in a couple of years, you know, nudge, nudge, wink, wink, we're going to come back and [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3962.4s)]
*  repeal it. Except Congress has stalled out. There's this ineptitude where anytime someone tries to pass [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3965.2000000000003s)]
*  a bill in Congress, someone else says, I want to get money. And so the Democrats showed up and said, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3971.44s)]
*  we want this child tax credit thing to show up, which basically was passed during COVID. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3976.88s)]
*  And they want to extend it going forward. And the child tax credit says that you can get a check for [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3983.8399999999997s)]
*  1800 a year in 2023, 1900 in 2024, and $2,000 in 2025 for each child you have. And the Republicans [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3989.2s)]
*  in the Senate are saying, wait a second, for people to get this thing, we want to make sure [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=3997.7599999999998s)]
*  they're working. We want to make sure it's not as retroactive. So now there's this big debate about [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4001.4399999999996s)]
*  how big the child tax credit should be. And that's keeping this R&D thing from going through. And [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4005.4399999999996s)]
*  meanwhile, I've gotten tons of emails from CEOs of tech companies that are breaking even. These [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4010.96s)]
*  are not tech companies that are making a ton of profit. They're not public. They're not venture [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4015.92s)]
*  backed. They're just people running their business. And now they're going to have this huge tax bill, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4019.44s)]
*  even though they didn't make any money this year. And it's crippling businesses around the country. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4025.44s)]
*  And what do they do? They're going to write a check. They're going to borrow money. They're [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4029.76s)]
*  going to go to the bank, borrow money, or they're going to incur penalties with the IRS because they [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4033.68s)]
*  don't have the cash to pay the tax bill because they don't have any profit. They didn't make any [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4037.12s)]
*  money. If they just ran the business break even, which a lot of these companies do is just make a [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4040.88s)]
*  little bit of money or break even. And then they've got this huge tax bill and profits they didn't [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4044.96s)]
*  actually have. They got to go figure out how to write a check. And also how do you define R&D? [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4048.96s)]
*  I was talking to an accountant. He's like, yeah, I don't know if that's R&D. I'm like, you don't [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4052.88s)]
*  know it's R&D? Like, okay, so if I meet some piece of software, yeah. Yeah. There's all this writing [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4055.84s)]
*  in the, if you get audited by the IRS, they have the ability to basically capture everything. So [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4061.52s)]
*  let's say you're a mobile app developer and you make a million dollars a year, but you spend a [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4067.8399999999997s)]
*  million dollars a year on your developers. They're going to count that. They have the ability to [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4072.56s)]
*  count that as an R&D. So the accountants, the tax accountants tell you book it all as R&D because [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4077.6s)]
*  otherwise you could get audited and actually get in trouble because anything that involves the [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4082.3999999999996s)]
*  development of technology now is considered R&D. Again, a company working in life sciences as a [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4086.0s)]
*  research company doing lab work can kind of get it fixed. Yeah, but if I do bug fixes, is a bug fix [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4091.2s)]
*  R&D. If I make a new feature in an application this year, does it have to be amortized over five [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4096.0s)]
*  years? Am I put a new filter? I'm not a tax attorney. My understanding is most of this stuff [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4101.68s)]
*  is getting captured and that's why it's hurting everything from defense to life sciences, to lab [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4106.24s)]
*  equipment, to startups, that's so software to everything. And Congress can't get out of its [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4111.28s)]
*  own way where this bill passed by the way, bipartisan in the house. Then it went to the Senate [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4116.88s)]
*  and now it's getting taken apart in the Senate and now it's stalled out and everyone's freaking [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4122.56s)]
*  out that it's stalled out past April 15th. And it's actually going to hurt a lot of small [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4125.76s)]
*  businesses in this country. And here's the other problem is it actually limits our ability to [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4130.0s)]
*  invest in innovation in this country because now you're better off. There's no other country in [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4135.360000000001s)]
*  the world that does this. Every other country in the world tries to incentivize investment [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4139.76s)]
*  in innovation. And here in the U S we're basically saying, no, we're going to tax you [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4144.0s)]
*  for investing in technology development and innovation. And the other thing that's actually [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4149.280000000001s)]
*  not being talked about is even in this bill where they're repealing this, they're leaving in [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4153.92s)]
*  the fact that if you invest in R and D outside the U S you have to amortize it over 15 years. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4160.08s)]
*  So let's say that you're a U S developer and you hire people offshore. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4166.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. You got to basically amortize the offshore stuff over 15 years, [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4169.92s)]
*  which means you'll never make a profit. You're always going to have to pay taxes. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4174.4800000000005s)]
*  We're trying to kill innovation in this country and the two things they got to solve is this one [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4177.84s)]
*  and then M and A. We got to have a better solution for allowing companies to be bought and sold in [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4183.2s)]
*  this or merge in this country. These two things are putting a lot of headwinds on the startup [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4190.16s)]
*  ecosystem and on the venture and the risk taking capital ecosystems. If you're in [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4196.88s)]
*  Washington, DC, you're involved in our government, please solve these two issues. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4203.679999999999s)]
*  You got to figure out a way to allow companies to be bought and sold. You got to figure out a way [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4207.84s)]
*  to fix this tax issue or else we're going to kill a lot of startups. And these are the companies [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4213.44s)]
*  that pay a lot of taxes and these are the capital gains that fund a lot of state's [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4218.96s)]
*  treasuries. It also an illustration of just how hungry we are for tax revenue in this country. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4223.36s)]
*  It's only going to grow and I'm not sitting here complaining about taxes. The Trump tax cut that [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4230.32s)]
*  he put in place in 2017 added one and a half trillion dollars to the federal deficit. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4235.04s)]
*  So tax cuts in general are not great when you're spending a lot, but it does highlight just how [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4240.32s)]
*  much we are spending at the federal level and the demand for tax revenue. And that demand causes [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4245.04s)]
*  this countercyclical problem, which is now we're going to eat into innovation, which is supposed [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4250.719999999999s)]
*  to drive, get us out of the problem, the spiral that results from this debt. So it really highlights [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4254.88s)]
*  just the challenges that are going to emerge, particularly in a decade ahead, because we have [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4261.44s)]
*  all of the spending that's coming in front of us over the next decade and how we're going to start [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4265.5199999999995s)]
*  to demand more and more tax and all these weird ways that can really hurt industry. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4269.12s)]
*  Unintended consequences are very real. Shamathi, you were going to say something? [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4273.599999999999s)]
*  Well, doesn't it mean though, that if you run it at break even and without a lot of growth by year [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4279.36s)]
*  five, you'll be back to where you were. So you really have to cover the taxes in years one through [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4285.76s)]
*  four. That's right. If the business, but if the business is growing, you're always going to be in [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4290.4s)]
*  a hole. Right. Right. So if your revenue is growing and your OPEX is growing, you're always [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4294.24s)]
*  going to be in a hole. I think Jason mentioned it earlier and I think it's the key thing, which is [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4299.5199999999995s)]
*  what is R and D then. Yeah. And maybe you just move things to cogs and just be done with it. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4303.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, that's what I would do. Remember businesses and you guys know this, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4309.679999999999s)]
*  like when you look at a public company's financials, what you're seeing is their [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4313.76s)]
*  gap financials, generally accepted accounting principles. And that's the way that you present [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4317.04s)]
*  the financials of a business. That's different than the way you present financials to the IRS. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4322.64s)]
*  You don't have a lot of discretion in your tax financials. Your tax financials are actually [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4327.12s)]
*  quite different than your gap financials. So when you file your taxes, there's a lot of rules on [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4332.0s)]
*  what you are allowed to deduct and aren't allowed to deduct. It's quite different than how you [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4337.52s)]
*  present your corporate financials to investors. And that's really where people get screwed. You [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4341.200000000001s)]
*  don't have that sort of discretion that you do in kind of sharing your financials with investors. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4345.12s)]
*  This is not financial or accounting advice. Get great representation. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4350.8s)]
*  I just hope Congress resolves this because it's, you know, super important. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4353.92s)]
*  All right. Sports betting has gone mainstream. If you don't know two out of three colleges have [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4357.36s)]
*  placed a bet in the last year since the Supreme Court struck down the amateur sports protection [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4361.76s)]
*  act. 38 states have legalized sports betting. I think that's a great thing, but we're starting [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4367.44s)]
*  to see some weird behavior because of it. Tons of sites like DraftKings, FanDuel, ESPN bet, [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4372.08s)]
*  MGM, all of these have broken out. But this week, we started to see some weird behavior. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4378.719999999999s)]
*  The NBA banned a 24 year old player, John T. Porter for life after a scandal. This one is bizarre [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4384.16s)]
*  and interesting. Porter was bench player for the Toronto Raptors averaging about 14 minutes per [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4392.879999999999s)]
*  game. It's important on these gambling apps, you can do all kinds of prop bets for those of you who [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4398.08s)]
*  don't know. Prop bets could be things like Steph is going to hit five threes in the game or LeBron [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4402.8s)]
*  is going to score under 30 points. You're just betting on unique things that could happen and [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4409.68s)]
*  then you can parlay them together. You can put multiple bets together and it automatically gives [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4413.52s)]
*  you a price and you can do really, you know, deep wagers doing this. The NBA found out that Porter [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4417.52s)]
*  was telling people to bet his unders for points and rebounds during certain games. During those [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4425.76s)]
*  games, he'd play a few minutes, then check them out self out of the game with an illness, [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4430.72s)]
*  quote unquote. Technically, the bet would still count since he played the game, but everybody who [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4435.84s)]
*  bet his unders would win. Normally, nobody would notice this, of course, because he doesn't play [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4440.4800000000005s)]
*  that much. He's a bench player. But DraftKings because they have all the data tipped everyone [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4445.2s)]
*  off because Porter was the biggest moneymaker on March 20. This led to an NBA investigation. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4451.360000000001s)]
*  DraftKings will give you a leaderboard of the biggest bets. And they saw that somebody placed [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4458.72s)]
*  an $80,000 bet that Porter would hit the unders on a bunch of different categories. Crazy outlier bet [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4462.72s)]
*  DraftKings canceled the bet. The NBA found that Porter separately placed dozens of bets on NBA [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4468.320000000001s)]
*  games using his friends accounts, winning a whopping $22,000. And this idiot now is banned [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4474.56s)]
*  from the NBA, allegedly, allegedly, allegedly. But obviously, the NBA has the receipts with [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4482.0s)]
*  DraftKings. Chamath, you owned a NBA team for a little while and you watched as David Stern, [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4489.44s)]
*  for a decade, you watch as David Stern, who was absolutely opposed to gambling. And then Adam [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4495.84s)]
*  Silver embraced it. Tell us from your front row seat, your thoughts on wagering in the NBA. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4502.64s)]
*  Well, and wagering writ large. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4508.64s)]
*  Okay, look, I remember when [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4511.52s)]
*  I joined the ownership group of the Warriors, I had to file this enormous document. And one of [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4518.16s)]
*  the things that they really dig into is whether you've bet before. And they make it really, [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4523.92s)]
*  really clear that it is completely not allowed to bet. And the only way that you can bet is if [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4531.12s)]
*  you're betting on non-basketball and if you were in Vegas and you go to a casino and a troop sports [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4538.32s)]
*  book, that's the only time it's tolerated. The thing with all of these sites, FanDuel and DraftKings, [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4543.04s)]
*  is they did deals with the leagues, where part of the feature is that when there is really crazy, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4549.04s)]
*  asymmetric betting on something that's obscured, they reported back to the leagues. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4556.08s)]
*  So the leagues know how to look at it. Because typically what happens is, [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4560.72s)]
*  if you're talking like a very well-contested basketball Jason, you have a relatively balanced [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4564.56s)]
*  book. And what the goal is, is to figure out where the sharps betting, meaning the really [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4570.88s)]
*  smart money guys, and everybody else is a square and most of retail is a square. They're going to [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4575.84s)]
*  lose their money. And so the goal is to always find out where the sharps are going. But there [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4580.88s)]
*  are some of these bets. And in this case, this is why they found out. When you have something [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4585.12s)]
*  being bet that's very obscure in size, these apps immediately go back to the league and say, [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4590.16s)]
*  this just happened. So compare that to Chamath, what would happen previously before sports betting [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4596.24s)]
*  was legal in the US? Before what would happen is like, all of these bookies would be able to [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4602.16s)]
*  have relationships with some of these players. Sometimes they would also have relationships [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4607.84s)]
*  with some of the refs. And it has spilled over. So the NBA has had to deal with an example where [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4612.639999999999s)]
*  one of the refs were, I think he was betting on some Tim Donahue, Tim Donahue, and then he was [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4618.32s)]
*  point shaving. So this has been going on for a long time. It moved into the realm of it being [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4622.799999999999s)]
*  automated with algorithms looking out. The fact that this kid didn't have anybody on his team that [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4629.84s)]
*  explained that draft Kings and FanDuel are going to send this data to the NBA is inexcusable, [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4636.48s)]
*  because maybe the kid would not have done it. Right? Do you agree with the lifetime ban? Or [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4643.599999999999s)]
*  do you think this should be? Yeah, it has to be lifetime. Has to be for the NBA to have integrity. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4647.92s)]
*  It's really and what do we think about this becoming legal in the US and people? [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4654.64s)]
*  The other thing I'll say, well, the other thing I'll say, and I mentioned this a few weeks ago, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4661.12s)]
*  everything is being gamified. You have an entire population that seemingly in America, consumer [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4666.24s)]
*  spending still goes up. Folks are relatively still flush with cash. There's lots of free cashflow. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4673.28s)]
*  There are new and more aggressive forms of stimulus constantly coming down the pike, [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4680.719999999999s)]
*  whether it's student loan forgiveness or something else, right? Governments are inventing new and new [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4687.44s)]
*  ways of buying votes. That's going to put more and more money in people's hands. That means a larger [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4691.44s)]
*  and larger percentage of it will bleed into these kinds of things. And it's not just sports gambling. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4696.88s)]
*  There was an article in the Wall Street Journal about this woman who's a well-respected lawyer [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4701.04s)]
*  who became totally addicted playing like a bingo app, right? And lost her entire life. So these [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4706.4s)]
*  forms of gambling and addiction are just going to skyrocket, I think, because you have these apps [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4712.64s)]
*  that are really incredibly well engineered to get you super hooked. And then the adrenaline rush and [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4717.6s)]
*  the dopamine rush of actually winning money is a thing that for some people, they can't turn off [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4725.2s)]
*  once they feel it for the first time. Yeah. We know some of those people and it's hard for them [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4730.24s)]
*  to control their sports, betting, blackjack playing, other things. They get too into it. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4733.92s)]
*  They get too into it. But other societies, other geos, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK, [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4740.48s)]
*  they've had this for a while, so they've figured out how to deal with this. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4747.84s)]
*  This is what I'm going to tell you. The last thing I'll say on this is when I was in high school, [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4750.4s)]
*  so in the early 90s in Ontario and Canada, they introduced sports betting as a way of generating [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4753.44s)]
*  revenue for the government. What I will tell you is that my entire high school, all the boys, [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4758.88s)]
*  not the girls, we became instant gambling addicts. We were figuring out how to put bets on. Most of [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4765.12s)]
*  it was betting in hockey because that's the sport that we all knew the best growing up in Ottawa. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4772.4800000000005s)]
*  But it was all day, every day. It consumed us. And I think when you look inside of these apps, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4779.2s)]
*  you're seeing a lot of young men with a lot of free cash and a lot of time getting sucked into [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4785.36s)]
*  the gamification of this thing. I think it's going to be a big problem. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4789.679999999999s)]
*  RG And I will tell you, Sax, I'm interested in your position on this because there is a whole [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4792.4s)]
*  system and ecosystem emerging here. The states are getting massive amounts of revenue. $11 billion [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4795.84s)]
*  generated last year, up 44.5% from 2022. The league is printing money from this, all the leagues. The [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4801.92s)]
*  NBA will generate $167 million from betting this season up 11% year over year. The sportsbooks, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4809.92s)]
*  obviously killing it. DraftKings got a $20 billion. Market cap and bettors obviously love it. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4815.68s)]
*  It's more fun. It's making the games more engaging. And the media is loving this. All of the podcasts, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4820.64s)]
*  Bill Simmons, ESPN, you can't watch a game. You can't hear sports commentary without this being [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4828.56s)]
*  integrated. And it's being integrated at a very fundamental editorial level. They're asking the [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4833.68s)]
*  hosts of the shows their spend and what they're betting on. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4838.8s)]
*  RG And they're doing something very smart, which is they're paying huge endorsement deals to the [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4842.16s)]
*  players as well. I think DraftKings did something with LeBron. This is genius because when you get [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4846.24s)]
*  that ingratiated, you'll never get ripped out. Because if they become a huge part of the off-court [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4850.96s)]
*  revenue model for these players- S1 We're locked in. It's like the new Air Jordans. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4856.320000000001s)]
*  Sax, what do you think about this just in terms of on a societal basis and the United States? [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4862.8s)]
*  You know, it's sort of like cannabis. You know, this is a new thing for Americans to have access [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4868.56s)]
*  to. There's a lot of weird behaviors going on, edge cases. But what do you think Net-Net as a [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4873.200000000001s)]
*  society you take away from the emergence of sports betting and this next generation being so addicted [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4878.16s)]
*  to it? RG Well, I think cannabis is the right analogy. I think adults should be allowed to bet [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4884.240000000001s)]
*  on sporting events, just like they're allowed to drink or, you know, smoke pot or engage in other [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4889.92s)]
*  mild vices. Some people handle it responsibly and some don't. It's probably on a societal basis, [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4896.16s)]
*  probably not a great thing, but it's something you allow to happen because of personal freedom [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4902.32s)]
*  and hopefully people use it responsibly. S1 Freeberg, you have any thoughts? You place [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4908.24s)]
*  any bets? Freeberg, you place any bets on sports? I'm curious. RG I do not. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4914.0s)]
*  S1 You do not. I don't place bets on sports, but I love playing cards because it's social. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4917.68s)]
*  Chamath, do you do any sports betting now and again? Maybe on the Super Bowl you get [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4922.72s)]
*  once in a while you place a bet, a wager? RG When I got admitted to the ownership group in the MBA, [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4927.12s)]
*  I stopped and I probably made three bets since then. All three were like on the Super Bowl [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4931.6s)]
*  at a casino, which so it was legal when I was still an owner and I've not done it since. And [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4938.96s)]
*  I've refused to download these apps because I love sports and I think that if I added this to it, [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4944.5599999999995s)]
*  I just don't think it would be good for me. So I don't want to do it. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4952.16s)]
*  S1 That was my exact take too. Sac, you ever place any bets? You're not a wager on the stuff [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4955.44s)]
*  either, right? Yeah. You ever bet on chess? Is there any gambling? [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4959.92s)]
*  RG No one bets on chess because it's so obvious who's going to win. There's like a very precise [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4964.4s)]
*  rating system. And so in poker, the poker is very different because you can have players at the same [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4968.32s)]
*  table and you know who are the great players and who are not the great players, but still in any [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4975.36s)]
*  given hand, the underdog can win because you can basically suck out or whatever. There's a significant [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4979.6s)]
*  luck component on every single hand over the long term. You believe that the luck kind of [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4985.76s)]
*  evens out and you reach your expected value, but on any given hand, you can believe that you're [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4990.64s)]
*  the winner. And so there's a lot of gambling and poker, even though it is a skill game in chess, [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=4996.400000000001s)]
*  like that just doesn't work. I mean, if I play Magnus Carlsen or any 2000 rated player, I'm just [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5001.76s)]
*  never going to win. So there's no point in betting. Sacks, what's your rating? [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5008.72s)]
*  1400. I'm a little better than that. I'm like, I'm probably more like 1600. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5013.4400000000005s)]
*  Last time I was 1400, I stopped playing them because he was just, I would get to the middle [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5018.64s)]
*  game with Sacks. I get like 30 moves in and then he would just smash me. I'm like 800 or something. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5022.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't want to talk about it. He doesn't want to talk. But what's your rating? [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5030.56s)]
*  Are you still upset about the octopus stuff? No. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5034.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, okay. What's your rating? It's too personal a question. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5038.080000000001s)]
*  It's too personal a question. Do you never share information where people can actually like, [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5042.56s)]
*  get to know you? Yeah, be vulnerable, dude. Come on. What is it? Ask me other questions. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5047.92s)]
*  Just don't ask me about my chest rating. Don't ask me about my chest rating. Ask me anything else. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5053.120000000001s)]
*  What is the best way to get better? Should I get a coach or something, Sacks? [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5057.52s)]
*  What's the best way to get better? The chess.com app has very good lessons on it too. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5061.120000000001s)]
*  It's actually quite good. Yeah, you could get a coach and that would definitely help. There's also [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5064.16s)]
*  these exercises you can do called puzzle rushes that teach you how to spot tactics. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5068.0s)]
*  So that's all tactics. That's probably half the game. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5072.48s)]
*  Like you learn how to do a night fork or something like that. How to do pins. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5076.5599999999995s)]
*  You just need to spot tactics quickly is really the key. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5079.76s)]
*  My puzzle rush scores are pretty good. Oh, you're over a thousand? [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5082.08s)]
*  It's like how many you can get in a certain period of time. How many? And it gets sequentially [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5087.04s)]
*  harder as you complete the puzzles and you have a limited period to do it. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5091.2s)]
*  Yet you feel shame. You feel shame. If you want to get better at chess, [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5096.8s)]
*  I've watched a lot of chess videos on YouTube and there's a very good series by John Bartholomew [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5100.32s)]
*  called Climbing the Ratings Ladder. And for each level of ELO ratings, he has a series of videos. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5106.48s)]
*  So like, I don't know, if you're like at 1200, there's a whole series for 1200s [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5113.44s)]
*  and he'll play a bunch of games against 1200s showing what they typically do wrong. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5117.84s)]
*  And you can learn from it. It's actually, it's a good series. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5123.2s)]
*  Have you spent time sacks like studying like openings and like studying like specific lines? [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5126.96s)]
*  I don't even know if I'm using the right language here. Like openings is right. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5133.76s)]
*  I haven't spent a ton of time studying them, but I'm certainly familiar with a number of the most [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5137.92s)]
*  common openings. So I guess, yes, I guess on some level I've studied them. I would say that [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5143.12s)]
*  depending on where you are in your development, that may not be the most pressing thing for you [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5149.04s)]
*  to do. You know, I think you probably do want to just know a few basics of a few of the most common [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5155.04s)]
*  openings, but there's probably other things for you to learn first. You don't need to like memorize [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5162.88s)]
*  a bunch of complicated lines. I think it's like really cool that kids are learning this. I know [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5167.5199999999995s)]
*  this may be a counter or a contrarian view, but I think kids having access, you know, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5172.48s)]
*  or young adults having access to sports betting poker is kind of a good thing because I, you know, [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5177.839999999999s)]
*  if controlled because they're learning about odds and gambling and framing it, I, um, with my 14 [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5183.36s)]
*  year old are doing an allowance and then I decided to do an investment club. And so I'm putting [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5190.32s)]
*  a hundred dollars every month into like a Robinhood account and we're going to do like two meetings [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5195.919999999999s)]
*  every month, one to buy a new stock and one to examine our existing stocks. And I'm just [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5201.2s)]
*  starting an investment club. So if anybody's kids are in that age group and they want to join it, [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5206.48s)]
*  let me know. Cause I'm going to do like a, with the cousins, like a zoom call every month where [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5210.32s)]
*  we just talk about stocks and then I'm going to have them actually buy it so that they can be [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5214.5599999999995s)]
*  prepared for the real world and how companies are going. But how do you think about your kids [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5220.48s)]
*  Chumoff? Cause you got to do this gambling when you were young. Didn't that help you ultimately [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5224.72s)]
*  as an adult? I mean, I ran a casino in my high school. Was that, was that the, uh, yeah. I mean, [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5229.36s)]
*  I ran a, I ran a little blackjack game where the rich kids could play and I was the house and I [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5237.2s)]
*  would make a few extra a hundred bucks a week. Nice. And that was great because like, you know, [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5242.799999999999s)]
*  between that and my job at Burger King, it really helped. And then I would go and take that. And I [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5248.24s)]
*  got you came pretty decent at blackjack and I would go, they would, they would be these what's [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5254.24s)]
*  called charity casinos. So casinos in Ottawa, Ontario were illegal, but if they were to raise [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5258.0s)]
*  charity for various charities, they were allowed. And so my friend, my friend and I would show up [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5262.56s)]
*  at these things and just run them over. Anybody else run an illegal business as a kid? I'll tell [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5268.48s)]
*  you about mine after SACs. You run any illegal businesses as a kid? No comment. Come on. It's [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5273.92s)]
*  that your limitations. What did you do? You must've been running some scams. Come on, tell us. I'll [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5279.2s)]
*  tell you my two scams. If you tell us yours. Well, by the way, I'll tell you, I had a bad [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5283.12s)]
*  debt situation in my, in my lunch game. You know, I used to, I used to let people bet up to a buck. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5286.16s)]
*  Okay. So four or five guys up, you know, 25 cents, 50 cents or a dollar. And one guy, he like demanded [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5292.08s)]
*  an expanded credit line. And so I gave him up to two bucks. How many boxes of ZD did he go down? [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5298.96s)]
*  And one lunch, he lost 80 bucks and it took me three months to get paid. It was the worst [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5304.32s)]
*  experience. 80 boxes of ZD? No, $80. I had to- No, I know. I'm just doing a surround. I had to, [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5308.72s)]
*  I had to sweat this guy for three months to get my $80. He was rich too. His parents were rich. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5314.16s)]
*  What'd he do? Did he have to do your term papers or something? Did he have to do your essays, [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5319.92s)]
*  clean your bike? I wouldn't have gotten this guy. Come on, give it up. What was your, [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5323.68s)]
*  what was your scam you were running? Let's move on. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5327.44s)]
*  I had two scams. Freeberg, you have a scam when you were running? When you were a kid? Any scams? [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5331.2s)]
*  I used to go to the recycler newspaper. Do you guys remember that? Yeah. The recycler. And I [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5336.8s)]
*  would buy used electronics equipment, computer equipment, and then I would sell it. So I would [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5341.92s)]
*  then post other ads. I basically did ad arbitrage as a way to think about it. So I would go and find [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5348.4800000000005s)]
*  people selling stuff that I thought was underpriced. But did you fix it? And then I would buy it. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5353.84s)]
*  And there was nothing to fix. It was underpriced. And then I knew the better market to go sell it [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5357.76s)]
*  and make more money. So then I'd buy all these old- Like a broken receiver. This disc man and [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5361.6s)]
*  a receiver, good speakers, speakers that I knew were good, but they were like steeply discounted. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5367.44s)]
*  I'd drive around in my white van. I'd pay people cash. I'd load it up and then I'd go sell it to [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5371.919999999999s)]
*  like other people by putting ads in. No wonder you wound up at Google. I had two really good scams [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5376.24s)]
*  when I was a kid. The first was this guy owed my dad some money for backgammon. My dad was a back [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5383.12s)]
*  gammon shark and he would play in his bar when I would show up at six in the morning. My dad would [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5388.639999999999s)]
*  be playing blackjack with guys. They would get in deep with him. And so this guy who was in the mob [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5392.56s)]
*  owed my dad some money. And for the VIG, he gave him a copy of the Empire Strikes Back on VHS. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5399.4400000000005s)]
*  And I was like, what? This is before it was out. They had recorded it in the movie theaters in 1984 [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5406.400000000001s)]
*  or something, whenever that came out. And it was a really bad copy. So my dad comes home, [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5412.320000000001s)]
*  he gives me the copy. We watched it. It was incredible. It's like, thanks dad. And I got [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5418.160000000001s)]
*  my friend to bring over his VHS. I made 10 copies of it. I go to school McKinley Junior High School [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5422.0s)]
*  in Brooklyn and I sell them for 30 bucks a pop. Oh my God. Selling like hotcakes. And then I get [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5426.4s)]
*  pinched. Math teacher says, what's going on with these Empire Strikes Back? And I said, what do [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5432.88s)]
*  you mean? I don't know what you're talking about. It's like, I heard you got Empire Strikes Back. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5439.2s)]
*  You kept your mouth shut. I looked them dead in the eye and I said, are you interested? [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5442.8s)]
*  And the teacher goes, yeah, how much are they? I said 30 bucks, but I'll give you one for 10. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5447.44s)]
*  And he said, okay, pull that 10 bucks. I sold my math teacher. I kid you're not the Empire [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5455.5199999999995s)]
*  Strikes Back for 10 bucks. Can you do this whole thing again, but in the Christopher Walken voice? [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5459.759999999999s)]
*  But I'll give you the other one I did. No, it's the Joe Pesci voice. Do this one in the Christopher [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5465.04s)]
*  Walken voice. And so the name of it was Jason's Hot Tapes. And so I made a business card and [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5469.12s)]
*  laminated Jason's Hot Tapes and I would hand it to people and I'd hand them the Jason's Hot Tape [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5473.52s)]
*  card. And I'd say, give me my card back. But I would just show them that I had a card. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5477.6s)]
*  I was also in the fake ID business. Who? Say more. Yeah, I don't know. I grinded out fake [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5482.320000000001s)]
*  IDs with a buddy of mine. All right. That was mine. That was mine. Oh, [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5487.76s)]
*  Zach was in the fake ID business too? We used Harvard Graphics. Zach, what were you using? [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5491.52s)]
*  I was using Harvard Graphics. Well, this was in the days before Holograms. And it just wasn't [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5495.84s)]
*  that hard to, you know, cop. So we just made like boards or whatever and Polaroids. So we did it [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5500.96s)]
*  for ourselves and we did it for friends. Yes. And here's the thing about the fake ID business. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5506.4800000000005s)]
*  The bouncers were like, if you've got money, show us any piece of paper. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5511.36s)]
*  They knew. They knew. We have plausible deniability. They just wanted plausible deniability. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5516.8s)]
*  Exactly. That's the key to the rack. Did you put McLovin in University of Hawaii? [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5521.36s)]
*  Yeah. Actually, well, it's kind of funny. Sometimes the bouncers would go, what's your name? [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5527.599999999999s)]
*  And you'd be like, you'd be stumped because you didn't remember. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5533.92s)]
*  You were so drunk you don't even remember. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5536.8s)]
*  Like, my name is Bob. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5540.16s)]
*  Mine was like Raj Patel. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5542.16s)]
*  Or they'd ask you, what was your birthday? And you don't remember what's on your ID. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5550.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5553.92s)]
*  You don't know what's on your ID because it's fake. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5554.16s)]
*  I don't remember. I don't remember. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5556.16s)]
*  The key. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5557.92s)]
*  I had one drink. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5558.719999999999s)]
*  Now the key in the fake ID game is to use your month and day that's yours and then just change [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5560.08s)]
*  the year. That's the key. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5566.96s)]
*  That's the key. All right. So I'll give you the second one. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5569.12s)]
*  Do it in the Christopher Walken voice. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5571.599999999999s)]
*  So my friend, his brother had a DeLorean. He, I can't do it. Anyway, this kid [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5573.84s)]
*  who I grew up with, I should say, anyways, name was beep that out. He lived up on 13th Avenue. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5583.52s)]
*  I go to his house. His brother's got a DeLorean. It was incredible. And we're in junior high school [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5590.320000000001s)]
*  and I'm talking to his brother and I go into the garage and there's all DeLorean parts on the wall. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5595.84s)]
*  And I said, why do you have all these parts? And he said, oh, you know, there was a DeLorean that, [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5602.64s)]
*  you know, fell apart and we picked up the pieces. They had stolen another DeLorean because DeLorean [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5609.84s)]
*  stopped producing and they just chopped it up, but he had it in his garage. So anyway, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5615.76s)]
*  we're playing chess master at the time and I had hacked a copy of chess master. It was very easy [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5619.92s)]
*  to do. And the guy said, you got chess master? Can you get me more copies of that? I said, sure. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5623.84s)]
*  How many copies you want? He's like, how many can you make? I was like, well, floppy discuss four [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5628.32s)]
*  bucks. He's like, I'll give you 10 bucks a copy of chess master. I said, fine. I go with my friend. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5632.0s)]
*  We go steal floppy disks from the store. So we didn't want to pay them four bucks for them. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5638.240000000001s)]
*  Not the, not the three and a half to five and a quarters. These are five and a quarters. And we go [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5643.4400000000005s)]
*  into the store and we take the flyer and I hold the flyer open and I hold it behind my back. And [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5647.68s)]
*  my friend takes the disks out of the sleeve at Staples, whatever. It's obviously in there. We [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5653.6s)]
*  made copies of it. And then we were selling chess master for 10 bucks a pop at scale and giving them [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5658.320000000001s)]
*  to the guys on 13th Avenue who were then reselling them for 20 bucks. This is when chess master was [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5663.04s)]
*  like a hundred dollar product. Shout out to chess master. That was my second scamp. This is some [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5667.36s)]
*  degenerate. Yeah. That's not even the best one. I'll give you the best one. This is the best. And [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5673.759999999999s)]
*  I'll give you the last scam we ran. There were parking permits in the late eighties in Manhattan. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5679.599999999999s)]
*  They were hard to get, but they were legit. If you had a parking permit in your window [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5686.24s)]
*  for the fire department police, you know, you could park in Manhattan in a lot of different areas. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5691.12s)]
*  And so we went and we took a picture of these. Then we got on page maker or whatever. And I went [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5697.04s)]
*  down to canal street and I bought at Pearl paints, like the same color orange and that lamination [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5703.679999999999s)]
*  kit. And we got on Photoshop. I kid you not, we held the picture up and we tried to figure out the [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5710.639999999999s)]
*  fonts they used and we made a copy of the placards to park. And then we sold those for like 50 bucks [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5715.2s)]
*  and people use them and they wouldn't get tickets. They worked. So we sold police placards that had [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5723.28s)]
*  to be super illegal in 1988. All right, everybody for your Sultan of science, the exception to [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5728.16s)]
*  free birth, your chairman dictator, the mouth by Hoppeteer, the rain man. Yeah. David sacks. I am [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5734.88s)]
*  your world's greatest moderator. J. Cal. We'll see you on episode one 76 and hopefully in September [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5742.24s)]
*  at the all in summit. Bye bye. Bye bye. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5748.56s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5778.56s)]
*  We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just like this, [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5783.68s)]
*  like sexual tension, but they just need to release them out. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5788.080000000001s)]
*  What? [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5791.76s)]
*  We need to get [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5797.04s)]
*  you [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=5808.56s)]
