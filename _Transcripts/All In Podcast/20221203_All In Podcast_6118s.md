# E106 SBF's media strategy, FTX culpability, ChatGPT, SaaS slowdown & more
**All In Podcast:** [December 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU)
*  I'm now recording. Jesus, you look terrible. What's going on? Did you sleep last night? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=0.0s)]
*  Do I look tired? Do you look a little tired? You look unshaven. Yeah, what happened last [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4.96s)]
*  night? I had a holiday party at my house last night for my office and you look destroyed. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=8.88s)]
*  Yeah, what's going on? I mean, did you drink? I did drink. Yeah. What does vodka and oat [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=13.56s)]
*  milk taste like? He had a white Russian. A white Russian, Big Lebowski style with oat [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=17.72s)]
*  milk. He's like, I want a white Russian with oat milk. Oh my god. Actually, my white Russian [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=24.88s)]
*  is made with oat milk. And please compliment that with a huge punch in the face. Give me [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=29.6s)]
*  five minutes. I'm going to go shave. It's called the hair of the dog. Yeah. You got [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  a little Bloody Mary. You banana bug. Banana man. Should I go get a beer? I'm going to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  get a beer just to beat this hangover. Go do it. Yeah, go get a beer. Hang on, I'll be [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=44.0s)]
*  right back. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=47.2s)]
*  All right, listen, we have to start with scam, bank run fraud. I mean, Sam Fried. I get [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=59.6s)]
*  that wrong sometimes. He was interviewed by Andrew Worsorken, the suit at Dealbook, who [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=72.52s)]
*  gave him softball after softball. Then the next day he was on Good Morning America. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=79.64s)]
*  You're being really passive aggressive right now. A little bit. I'm a little ship over [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  there. A little shipy. He's sticking the knife in. He's sticking the knife in. But [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=87.92s)]
*  J. Cal's got a point. He's got a point. A little bit. A little bit. Anyway, the New [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=92.84s)]
*  York Times continues to embarrass themselves by handling Sam Bankman fraud with kid gloves. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=98.0s)]
*  Wow. George Stephanopoulos, my Greek brother, Stephanopoulos the Spartan came in and absolutely [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=103.44s)]
*  fricasseed and filleted Sam Bankman Fried on Good Morning America. Very important to [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  note that Good Morning America, the segment was between holiday cocktails and the cast [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=116.52s)]
*  of The White Lotus. Andrew Worsorken was at the Dealbook Finance Conference. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=122.56s)]
*  But you know, that Stephanopoulos interview was two hours, but they reduced it down to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=128.04s)]
*  10 minutes. So there were probably a lot of sort of cordial conversation, banter, and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=132.16s)]
*  then softball questions. Then he does stick the knife in and does the fricassee, but he [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=139.24s)]
*  cuts out all the other stuff. So he just gets it down to the 10 minutes. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=145.6s)]
*  What Stephanopoulos did to him was extraordinary in that he said over and over again, in the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=148.28s)]
*  FTX terms of service, you cannot touch the user accounts, but you at Alameda were taking [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=154.32s)]
*  them and you were loaning them out. I don't know who is advising Sam Bankman Fried at [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=161.4s)]
*  this point, but why he is talking so much. He was also on a two hour Twitter spaces after [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=167.72s)]
*  all this. At this point, Sax, what do you think is going on here in the mind of Sam [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=176.0s)]
*  Bankman Fried and also the media, which seems to have a very variable way of dealing with [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=182.0s)]
*  this obvious fraud and crime? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=188.92s)]
*  Right. Okay. Well, you know, I can speculate about SPF. I think if there is a strategy [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=191.39999999999998s)]
*  here, it is this. He is basically copying to criminal negligence in order to avoid the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  more serious charges of fraud. And I think, again, if there's a strategy here, it is he [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=205.04s)]
*  saw himself being defined as Bernie Madoff 2.0 in the press. And if that image, which [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  may well be true, cemented around him, then prosecutors would never stop. They would never [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=218.4s)]
*  accept a plea that basically gave him anything less than a Madoff like sentence, which would [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=224.0s)]
*  be, you know, decades in prison, maybe a life sentence. So he is out there doing what lawyers [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=230.6s)]
*  would tell you never to do, which is basically incriminate yourself, create more of a record. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  But he's doing it to change the public perception, maybe muddy up the public perception, get [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=240.32s)]
*  people thinking that, okay, he, you know, this that he's admitting he did something [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=246.2s)]
*  wrong, but it wasn't deliberate, it wasn't fraudulent. It was just basically carelessness [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=251.32s)]
*  or sloppiness. And if he succeeds in muddying the waters enough, then maybe the prosecutors [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=256.52s)]
*  will give him a plea deal that allows him to have his life back at some point. I think [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=261.71999999999997s)]
*  that would be the crazy like a fox explanation of what's happening. Now, there is, you know, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=265.32s)]
*  an alternative explanation as well, which is I just think that these types of guys, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=271.72s)]
*  you could call it, you know, a narcissistic fraudster, they think they can talk the way [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=276.64000000000004s)]
*  out of anything, you know, because they have, they have, you know, they've talked their [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=281.76000000000005s)]
*  way into getting hundreds of millions of dollars of investment, billions, billions, in some [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=287.8s)]
*  cases. And so they just feel, and they've been trained by employees, partners, investors, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=293.48s)]
*  the press that they can talk their way out of any of this stuff. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=300.24s)]
*  Yeah, the average person is not really used to dealing with one of these personality types [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=302.92s)]
*  who is, I mean, they clearly are smart and they're articulate, articulate, and they know [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  what to say. And they're crafting their words. What they've learned through their life is [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=312.92s)]
*  that if they use the precise magic words with a person, they can pretty much, you know, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=316.56s)]
*  convince them of anything, get them to do anything. And in particular, I would say investors [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=321.44s)]
*  tend to fall for this, not because investors are dumb, but because investors are so clear [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=325.02s)]
*  about what they're looking for and what they want. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=330.18s)]
*  They're predictable. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=332.21999999999997s)]
*  They're predictable. Yeah. Like we're, you know, VCs, especially we're looking for the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=333.21999999999997s)]
*  100X outcome or whatever. So it's easy for this type of personality to construct a story [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=335.5s)]
*  to essentially stroke the erogenous zones of a VC. Yeah. And, and, and sort of trick [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=343.09999999999997s)]
*  them. And so there is probably a positive reinforcement loop that gets created in the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=348.41999999999996s)]
*  minds of one of these people who, and they start to think that they can basically talk [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=353.1s)]
*  their way out of any situation. So I think that would be part of what's going on here. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=356.66s)]
*  And you know, if you look at sort of the tactics that he's using to do this, you know, all [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=361.98s)]
*  of a sudden he's trying to portray himself, you know, before this, he was portraying himself [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=366.66s)]
*  as a smart guy in the room. Now all of a sudden there's this babe in the woods impression [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=371.46s)]
*  where I didn't know it was my subordinates. I wasn't really in control. That was somebody [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=375.78s)]
*  else. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=381.42s)]
*  Each individual decision he says looked sensible to him. It's just it all added up to something [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=382.90000000000003s)]
*  he didn't anticipate. Like really? You know, loaning yourself a billion dollars of basically [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=388.14000000000004s)]
*  the company's money, which was basically customer money, that seemed reasonable to you. I don't [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=395.06s)]
*  know how you defend that individual decision. And there's many like that, but, but this [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=398.14000000000004s)]
*  is sort of the narrative that he's trying to construct. And let me stop there, but I [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=402.38s)]
*  think there's a lot more that can be said to dismantle the narrative he's trying to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=407.3s)]
*  create. But I want to let other people get in here. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=411.66s)]
*  Shumoff, what's your take on this and then Freiburg, what are you? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=412.66s)]
*  Can I make a comparison to SPF and Trump through the lens of the media? So if you go back to [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=414.94s)]
*  2016, you know, Donald Trump violated every single establishment bias that these left [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=422.06s)]
*  progressive journalist elites had. And so they basically just attacked, attacked, attacked, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=431.5s)]
*  attacked. But then you went into the election. And there was a very clear data point that [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=437.22s)]
*  said whatever you thought was that was at best limited, and you missed the tone of the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=443.94000000000005s)]
*  country. Because 50 plus percent of the country held a very different view about this person. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=449.66s)]
*  And instead of taking a step back, and then the left media, the mainstream media, re underwriting [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=457.84000000000003s)]
*  and learning and then saying, you know what, mea culpa, I got this wrong. They just doubled [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=464.86s)]
*  down. And they said, No, it still doesn't meet our priors. And so we're just going to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=469.18s)]
*  ring fence this problem. And we're going to just try to destroy this issue. Because, you [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=475.02s)]
*  know, we want to control the narrative. And by result, we want to control power. Now you [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=479.74s)]
*  look at SPF, it's the exact opposite. He went to the perfect elite private high school. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=486.26s)]
*  When he went to one of the most prestigious elite private universities, MIT, his parents [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=492.98s)]
*  teach governance of all things at one of the most elite liberal institutions in America, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=499.1s)]
*  Stanford, they are in the establishment of the progressive left. And what happened was, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=504.74s)]
*  he took customer funds and all of this money, he made 10s of millions of dollars of political [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=512.44s)]
*  donations. He wrapped himself in this blanket of a progressive left leaning cause called [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=518.22s)]
*  effective altruism. And all of the mainstream media fell for it and embraced him as well [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=523.14s)]
*  as some politicians, because it met everything that they themselves also bought into. Yes. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=529.5s)]
*  And now you have this cataclysmic event, a multi deck a billion dollar fraud or bankruptcy, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=538.4200000000001s)]
*  millions of customer accounts who are frozen, you know, 10s of millions to hundreds of millions [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=545.34s)]
*  to billions of dollars lost and stolen from them. And they refuse to re underwrite this [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=550.86s)]
*  kid. And the reason is because in order to do so, it's like eating your own tail. And [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=556.24s)]
*  that's why they don't want to do it. And so this is why you have the media basically allowing [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=561.98s)]
*  him to do an apology tour. Now, this is his second time at manipulating them. The first [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=567.14s)]
*  time he was able to manipulate them by basically being one of them. And now he's allowing them [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=572.74s)]
*  and their desire to basically protect themselves so that he can create some kind of a defense for [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=580.0600000000001s)]
*  himself. And I just think the whole thing is gross because it misses the entire mood of the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=585.66s)]
*  nation. This is an enormous financial fraud that was perpetrated on 10s of millions of people. And [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=591.02s)]
*  there's no accountability because in order to do so, the media would effectively have to admit [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=600.5400000000001s)]
*  that they missed it and they got it wrong. And they refuse to do it. And I think that that is [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=604.94s)]
*  the really big problem that nobody is really speaking out about is like, well, if these folks [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=609.0200000000001s)]
*  are meant to be the last stop to make sure that there's truth and honesty and transparency in [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=613.9000000000001s)]
*  society, and you can't count on them. And in fact, they're just going to reflect their own [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=620.5s)]
*  narrative. What is one supposed to do to learn the truth? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=624.62s)]
*  In a way, what you're saying, and then we'll go to you, Freberg, is this fraud was encased in all [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=627.18s)]
*  the gilded facade that America hates right now. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=633.3399999999999s)]
*  It reflects the institutional rot of America. It reflects every single aspect of institutional [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=637.0999999999999s)]
*  rot that every non elite talks about all the time. But elites when they have those labels will refuse [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=642.54s)]
*  to give up. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=649.9s)]
*  And just to add to that, the thing that's missing, I'd say one of the big issues with the [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=650.6600000000001s)]
*  institutional rot in our country is the lack of accountability when somebody gets it wrong. We saw [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=656.5s)]
*  this with COVID, right? The health establishment is saying that they want amnesty and Atlantic [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=661.3000000000001s)]
*  magazine was willing to give it to them. So the point is that this this class of people think [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=667.3000000000001s)]
*  that when they get it wrong, that they're the experts, but when they get it wrong, there should [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=672.5s)]
*  be no accountability. And so Jamath, to your point, the media is not going to be able to [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=675.7s)]
*  and these institutions are not willing to re underwrite SBF when he's so clearly as a fraudster. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=680.5s)]
*  Freberg, what do you think of this theory? You had a large amount of donations to politicians. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=687.06s)]
*  Obviously, you have coming from Stanford, MIT, etc. And then you have these investments, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=694.66s)]
*  gifts, slash advertising, slash donations to ProPublica, Vox, this new publication Semaphore, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=702.26s)]
*  the intercept that have all been uncovered now. Did he do this paying off of all the elites, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=709.3s)]
*  you know, splashy, cashy, giving money to everybody because he knew he was doing a fraud and that this [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=716.66s)]
*  is evidence of this is a premeditated fraud? Or do you think this is a deranged individual who [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=721.3s)]
*  just was seeking status? I don't know. The motivation, there's a video you can watch of this guy. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=726.8199999999999s)]
*  For some reason, FTX has left up all of their videos on YouTube from three years ago called [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=733.7800000000001s)]
*  quantitative trading, seven and a half thousand cell wall of Bitcoin on Binance. It's a 17 and [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=739.94s)]
*  a half minute YouTube video of SBF trading arbitrage across markets. I think it provides [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=746.34s)]
*  probably the best like natural non scripted insight into this guy's behavior that you could see. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=754.1s)]
*  You know, if it's not like him being interviewed, it's just him living in his world. And he's just, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=761.2199999999999s)]
*  you know, a mouse trying to get a piece of cheese. Like, he's, you know, he's like out there, he's, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=766.66s)]
*  you know, scrambling around in the markets, he's finding edges, he's finding advantages, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=772.3399999999999s)]
*  and he's, and he's clearly just taking advantage of them all day, every day. That's who he is. Now, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=776.9s)]
*  you put a person like that in an unregulated environment, and there was this clustering demand [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=782.8199999999999s)]
*  for an unregulated environment because of a lot of what you guys are saying, which is people have [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=789.14s)]
*  this disdain for the elitism and the institutional rot and all these things. So Bitcoin emerged as a [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=794.58s)]
*  solution out of 2008 to the, you know, the what felt like institutional rot [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=801.38s)]
*  that governments have a key role in. But when you have no regulation, and you have no trusted [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=810.02s)]
*  central authority involved, mice that are trying to find cheese will rule the day. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=815.3s)]
*  And I think that's what happened here. If it wasn't this guy, it was someone else. It was going to be [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=818.58s)]
*  someone else. And then all of a sudden, everyone's clamoring and saying, hey, we needed the government [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=822.5s)]
*  to protect us. No one protected us. Someone's got to save us. We're the regulators. We're people [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=826.02s)]
*  that are supposed to keep an eye on this stuff. When the whole premise of so much of what was being [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=830.5s)]
*  sold was non-regulatory regimes, was openness, was peer-to-peer trust protocols. And it turns out, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=834.58s)]
*  in that sort of an environment, the mouse that is hungriest for the cheese will get the cheese. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=842.2600000000001s)]
*  And that's exactly what happened. And I don't know how much of it was him saying, I'm creating [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=845.86s)]
*  intentional fraud, which certainly seems to be the case, versus him saying, I'm going to pay these [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=850.5s)]
*  guys. I don't know how much of it was even that intelligent. But the guy was clearly like, trying [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=854.6600000000001s)]
*  to get a piece of cheese. Okay, so this cheese eater, this rat is a League of Legends expert [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=859.22s)]
*  playing on eight different monitors at a time, the cryptocurrency game, while hopped up on speed. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=868.1s)]
*  I'm not saying that to be cruel. I'm saying that because they admitted it. They talked about it [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=873.62s)]
*  in their staff meetings, instructing their traders and team members of how to take speed. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=879.62s)]
*  He admitted to it in an interview this week. He said that it was all legal prescription drugs, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=885.62s)]
*  but they were taking them. Yes. Yes. And literally in the same video as you're referencing, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=889.46s)]
*  people see speed patches, or I don't even understand this, but there are patches you can [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=894.42s)]
*  put on your body to deliver speed to you at some, you know, dose or whatever. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=898.18s)]
*  Sax, you buy this theory. No care that this isn't about the elite side of it. It's about the [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=902.8199999999999s)]
*  non elite, the anarchy side of it. No, and this cheese eating rat was just wanted to eat more. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=907.9399999999999s)]
*  I don't buy this narrative because I see too much design intentionality in the [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=914.98s)]
*  time what happened. So in other words, it wasn't just a series of individual decisions that didn't [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=919.38s)]
*  add up. Many of those individual decisions by themselves were totally unjustifiable. And more [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=923.9399999999999s)]
*  over, there were too many, there's too much evidence of sophisticated behavior here. Again, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=929.46s)]
*  he overnight went from portraying himself as a smart guy in the room to the, to the babe in the [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=935.9399999999999s)]
*  woods. And so for example, when you look at the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=940.34s)]
*  for example, when you look at the construction of all these entities and the corporate org chart, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=947.7s)]
*  you know, of all the related entities, it's a very sophisticated attempt to obscure and construct [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=954.1s)]
*  certain, you know, protections. When you look at the way that Alameda was exempted from the normal [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=961.38s)]
*  margin requirements and FTX, there was the so-called back doors. There was intentionality [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=968.34s)]
*  there. There was intentionality in terms of who was hired to staff these organizations. Again, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=972.74s)]
*  wasn't hired, no board, no CFO. Yeah. And the guy, the guy who was in charge of compliance, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=977.78s)]
*  what like tomorrow talked about in previous episode was the guy who was involved in the ultimate bet [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=984.18s)]
*  poker cheating scandal, you know, not super mode. Yeah, exactly. Right. Or look at this goofy goof [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=990.18s)]
*  ball, Caroline Ellison, who was put in charge of Alameda, right? His girlfriend. It's, it's being [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=996.26s)]
*  done for a reason, right? He's setting it up in a certain way. And, you know, the one time I [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1001.54s)]
*  interacted with him at this tech conference, he was sitting there holding court and he had all of [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1005.78s)]
*  his minions around him who were following his orders. This was a guy who was controlling [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1010.5799999999999s)]
*  his business. He was making the decisions at, I think, a task level and he knew exactly what was [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1016.02s)]
*  going on here. So look, I just don't buy, I do not buy this idea that, that he was like a blind mouse [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1023.54s)]
*  who's just stimulus response, you know, in the moment. By the way, that wasn't, that wasn't my [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1031.86s)]
*  point, Sachs. My point was whether it was him or it was going to be someone else, it was bound to [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1037.2199999999998s)]
*  happen. No, I don't agree with that. That the idea that we want to have completely free, unregulated, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1043.06s)]
*  Bahamian based trading, you know, environments that we can supposedly trust because someone puts on a [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1049.06s)]
*  good face when there is no real regulatory body and regulatory authority overseeing it, at some [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1055.62s)]
*  point it was going to happen. Well, no, hold on. It is, look, Coinbase is a fully regulated institution. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1060.9s)]
*  But they're regulated. They're not set up in the Bahamas and they're not unregulated. He set up and [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1066.1000000000001s)]
*  he had no oversight. He had no board. There was no regulatory regime. There was nothing. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1069.7s)]
*  But how was he able, but okay, so first of all, look, I don't think this had to happen. I think [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1073.94s)]
*  that, again, I think that excuses too much because it implies that if it wasn't SBF, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1077.7s)]
*  it'd be somebody else. I actually think that this was a highly concerted effort. Listen, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1082.1000000000001s)]
*  he courted regulators. He donated to politicians. He courted the media and donated to them. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1086.26s)]
*  Yeah, he was really good at it. He was really good at it. He was unusually good at it. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1092.1s)]
*  No, and I totally agree on that. Yeah, super smart, super connected, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1096.02s)]
*  really thoughtful design on how he committed this. I only think an insider could have pulled off [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1099.3799999999999s)]
*  something at this scale. I think I agree. This is where Chamath, you're exactly right. I think [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1104.26s)]
*  you needed to be an insider. He knew the playbook and he admitted it. You pointed this out with the [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1108.5s)]
*  chats that were released where he said he he he he he. Yeah, look, I mean, look, just like he he [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1114.26s)]
*  chat. Look how like convoluted and intertwined all these people are like Gensler's intertwined [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1119.14s)]
*  with the parents. Yeah, parents apparently bundled a bunch of money to Elizabeth Warren. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1124.74s)]
*  You know, he was dating the CEO of the business that he owned 90% in there all these other random [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1129.86s)]
*  shell companies that he owned 100% of where they were lending back and forth hundreds of millions [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1136.02s)]
*  to billions of dollars. Yeah, to David's point, that is a sophisticated con that you have to [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1140.5s)]
*  architect. And the way that he was able to get away with it is that not a single reporter or [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1146.5s)]
*  regulator thought to dig in. And the reason I think is because he said all of the right things [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1152.02s)]
*  that wanted them to embrace him. And the reason is he admitted it. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1159.46s)]
*  This is a dumb game that we woke Westerners have to play. The right should bless and then everyone [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1164.26s)]
*  thinks we're a good person. Exactly. Imagine pull that quote up on what he said, because it's [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1168.42s)]
*  actually a good quote. I just said exactly what he said. He said it's the game that we woke [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1171.94s)]
*  Westerners have to play. We say the right should bless everyone likes us. He actually said the most [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1177.46s)]
*  uncomfortable thing out loud, which is look, by having gone to Crystal Springs High School, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1181.46s)]
*  by having professors, my parents that went to Stanford by having gone to MIT, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1186.02s)]
*  I can pull this off. That's that's what he said, because he can go with those things because I'm a [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1190.8200000000002s)]
*  champion of effective altruism that I can justify any of these decisions how amoral or immoral that [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1196.82s)]
*  they be because I'm trying to help you know, my brother stand up a multimillion dollar pandemic [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1203.14s)]
*  response business. I'm trying to do this. I'm trying to do that. And all of these regulators [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1207.86s)]
*  and all of these reporters said, Okay, you get the hall pass. Now imagine if you replaced him [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1213.86s)]
*  with some random kid in some developing country or even from the United States, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1219.38s)]
*  who did went to public high school, who went to some random state school, do you think that they [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1225.94s)]
*  could have pulled any of this stuff off? No, you need the patina of the privilege class. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1232.74s)]
*  The New York Times, what he had the privilege class, even after this fraud, the New York Times [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1237.7s)]
*  wrote more of a puff piece on him than the hit piece they wrote on Brian Armstrong last year, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1243.86s)]
*  when Brian Armstrong wouldn't toe the line on allowing politics at work. Remember that? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1248.18s)]
*  Yeah, unbelievable. Yeah. So the big I think what Jamath is kind of saying here is that the big [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1253.14s)]
*  enabler here is not crypto per se. It's all these institutional biases and elite biases that he was [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1257.0600000000002s)]
*  able to play into, partly because he was a big insider. I mean, in a way, he monetized his [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1263.54s)]
*  parents life work. The problem that I think this allows us to put a fine point on is the following. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1268.26s)]
*  You know, in society, we've confused a lot of people to think that the opposite of liberal [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1275.46s)]
*  is conservative or Republican. And I think that's the cycle that drives the mind virus [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1282.58s)]
*  inside the mainstream media. The problem is the opposite of liberal is illiberal. Okay. And what [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1289.1399999999999s)]
*  illiberal means is to be narrow minded and unenlightened. It means to be puritanical. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1295.1399999999999s)]
*  It means to be fundamentalist. And this is really what it allows us to see now. We have now had six [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1301.3000000000002s)]
*  years of data, case after case after case, where if you are woke, if you are a social justice warrior, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1307.38s)]
*  if you have the right credentials that justify your upbringing, if you have institutional [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1317.6200000000001s)]
*  bona fides that come from your parents, you get to create the narrative and you get a hall pass. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1324.18s)]
*  And everybody else basically is at the subject and the mercy of the mainstream media. And so, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1331.3000000000002s)]
*  if you don't kiss the ring and bow down to them, they will try to destroy you or run you out of [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1338.66s)]
*  town. But if you are one of them, they will give you a hall pass. And when it's time for them to [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1343.0600000000002s)]
*  change their mind in order to tell the truth, they won't do it. And so these types of griffs [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1348.5800000000002s)]
*  will continue as Friedberg said, because there is no check and balance without a healthy independent [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1354.98s)]
*  media. There is no way for all of us to actually know what's really going on. Guys, some person [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1360.18s)]
*  in the media could have asked the question and dug in deeper around the connections between Alameda [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1367.0600000000002s)]
*  and FTX for the last 24 months. At no point could any person have asked these questions and found [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1371.94s)]
*  ex-employees and said, you know, are there any unseemly connections here between FTX and Alameda? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1381.8600000000001s)]
*  There was no disgruntled employee. I mean, every company has disgruntled employee whistleblowers. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1387.46s)]
*  But here where there was billions of dollars being made by tens of people, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1393.22s)]
*  not a single person who felt on the outs said anything. He was also giving millions of dollars [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1396.66s)]
*  to press outlets in donations. Hold on. It's because the questions weren't asked. And then [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1402.02s)]
*  this kid paid hush money to the mainstream media. Let me ask you a question of you guys. Do you [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1406.02s)]
*  think that it's the media's responsibility in this context? Or do you think that there should [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1410.1000000000001s)]
*  have been a regulatory authority that had oversight of this business like there is for [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1413.78s)]
*  every bank and every trading operation in the United States? And every one of those businesses [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1417.7s)]
*  has a compliance officer and has regulators up the wazoo making sure that customers are kept safe [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1422.66s)]
*  and protected? Or do we think that should offshore vehicles be allowed like this [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1428.1s)]
*  that allow people to operate? It's a reasonable question, but there was a chicken and egg question. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1432.98s)]
*  We were all standing around holding our hands while the CFTC and the SEC were fighting. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1436.82s)]
*  That's not something that consumers can be expected to adjudicate. So, yes, we should have [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1442.34s)]
*  legislation that clearly defines all of this, but there were enough parameters that created [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1448.1s)]
*  regulatory frameworks where a bunch of good actors did operate in them and are continuing to do so, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1453.3799999999999s)]
*  like Coinbase. So I don't think this is a regulatory issue. I think that if you believe [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1458.82s)]
*  there are people who are supposed to forensically examine things and get to the bottom of things and [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1464.1s)]
*  ask hard questions, those people did none of that here. And then what's even more worrisome [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1469.14s)]
*  is what they're showing is now with a massive amount of data that shows that you could ask [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1476.1000000000001s)]
*  hard questions, they don't care to because it makes them look bad. I disagree with this, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1481.22s)]
*  Chumup. I think regulators failed here because they have been reactive to crypto. They have not [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1485.46s)]
*  been proactive and they have not been clear with the crypto community that what they were doing [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1489.7800000000002s)]
*  was illegal and they should have put the regulations in quicker and they're playing [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1494.0200000000002s)]
*  catch up. But all three groups failed. The media failed, the regulators failed, and VCs failed, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1497.22s)]
*  capital allocators failed, apparently, to do diligence here and install proper governance. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1502.66s)]
*  You cannot put a company like this in business with billions of dollars and have no board of [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1508.82s)]
*  directors. Or he lied to them, which is possible. My point is that while regulators are basically [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1515.06s)]
*  fighting a territorial turf war, the media could have still done their job. They chose not to. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1522.1s)]
*  Kyle Sivers Guys, it was worse than that because not only, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1528.1s)]
*  it's not just a case where the SEC failed to exercise any oversight of him or dig into any [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1530.1799999999998s)]
*  of these questions. He was in the room with them crafting the next set of regulations. He was [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1535.86s)]
*  working on the regulations that you're talking about that are supposedly needed. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1540.26s)]
*  Aaron Ross While breaking them. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1544.1s)]
*  Kyle Sivers They let the fox in the hen house. He was going to craft a new type of regulatory [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1544.82s)]
*  license for these types of exchanges with the result that he was going to get one and some of [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1551.3s)]
*  his competitors weren't. This is one of the things that triggered CZ to basically, you know, do what [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1556.6599999999999s)]
*  he did, which is basically that SPF was trying to get by Nance and competitors like that band, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1563.1399999999999s)]
*  while SPF would be one of the sole people to get the license. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1571.22s)]
*  Aaron Ross By the way, here's an example. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1574.26s)]
*  Kyle Sivers He was working with the regulators. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1575.86s)]
*  Aaron Ross Yeah, Jason, you just said something derogatory towards CZ. He rug pulled them. Did [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1577.14s)]
*  he do that? Or did he actually expose the fraud? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1581.8600000000001s)]
*  Jason Kuznicki That's what I mean by rug pulling. Yeah. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1583.94s)]
*  Kyle Sivers That's not what rug pull means, Jason. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1585.94s)]
*  Jason Kuznicki Okay, well, he was partners with him. And then he realized he was weak and that he [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1588.5s)]
*  was doing some stuff that was shady and he decided he would eliminate a partner who was creating [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1593.22s)]
*  regulation, as Sac said. Whatever you want to say, he knifed him. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1596.98s)]
*  Kyle Sivers All he did was indicate a desire to liquidate his position in a token that was [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1599.94s)]
*  supposedly perfectly liquid. And that's basically that caused everything to unravel. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1605.22s)]
*  Aaron Ross Yeah, but these were partners, right? I mean, these were deep business partners. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1610.26s)]
*  Kyle Sivers No, they're not. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1613.78s)]
*  Aaron Ross And they were partners. They were collaborating on these tokens together. So they [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1614.26s)]
*  weren't competitors. I don't think so. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1617.38s)]
*  Kyle Sivers No, they weren't. Jason, part of the big loan that initiated all of this stuff like a [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1618.26s)]
*  year and a half ago was to buy FTX off the cap table. So, you know, this is all I'm saying is [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1624.02s)]
*  you used words and your framing of a guy, you know, who's built a business is like he is this [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1631.0600000000002s)]
*  nefarious bad actor. But David's right. All the guy did, as far as we can tell right now, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1637.7800000000002s)]
*  is tweet, I'm selling this token because I don't believe in the capital structure of this entity. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1646.8200000000002s)]
*  And he got those tokens by being bought out of the cap table. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1651.3000000000002s)]
*  Kyle Sivers I know he was partners with them. So if you don't like rug pulled, how about backstab? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1654.9s)]
*  These were business partners. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1659.7s)]
*  Jason Kuznicki They're not partners. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1660.74s)]
*  Kyle Sivers You still don't understand, Jason. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1661.78s)]
*  Jason Kuznicki Of course I understand. He was the first investor. So to do this to a company you [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1663.22s)]
*  were making. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1668.18s)]
*  Kyle Sivers And then he got bought out. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1668.6599999999999s)]
*  Jason Kuznicki No, no. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1668.74s)]
*  Kyle Sivers Exactly. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1669.3s)]
*  Jason Kuznicki He got bought out. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1669.7s)]
*  Kyle Sivers And part of the consideration, hold on, part of the consideration were these tokens, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1670.5s)]
*  these FTX tokens. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1674.8999999999999s)]
*  Kyle Sivers I understand. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1675.46s)]
*  Jason Kuznicki Yes. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1675.86s)]
*  Kyle Sivers Jason, when you, when Uber went public, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1676.5s)]
*  Jason Kuznicki Yes. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1678.42s)]
*  Kyle Sivers And you got distributed stock, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1678.8999999999999s)]
*  Jason Kuznicki Yeah. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1680.98s)]
*  Kyle Sivers Did you distribute and sell Uber at any point? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1681.46s)]
*  Jason Kuznicki No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1684.02s)]
*  I'm asking you a question. When Uber went public and you got distributed from Uber, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1688.18s)]
*  Jason Kuznicki No. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1692.02s)]
*  Jason Kuznicki You're stock. So you've never sold a single share of Uber ever. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1692.5s)]
*  Kyle Sivers Not since it's public. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1695.22s)]
*  Jason Kuznicki No, I sold it before in private markets. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1695.94s)]
*  Kyle Sivers Okay, but I'm sorry, but that doesn't make Jason a partner of Uber. You're just a [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1698.26s)]
*  stockholder. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1701.86s)]
*  Jason Kuznicki Yeah, this is slightly different, I think. But okay, fine. You guys, if you guys want [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1702.42s)]
*  to consider, no, he was the first investor in the company. They were business partners. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1706.58s)]
*  They were business partners. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1710.26s)]
*  Kyle Sivers That might have been a historical situation, but their status at the time that [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1710.82s)]
*  CZ tweeted was that they were competitors. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1713.6999999999998s)]
*  Jason Kuznicki Okay, fine. I mean, they became competitors, I agree. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1716.34s)]
*  Kyle Sivers And by the way, to Tomas's point about this rug pulling language, I think we're [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1719.54s)]
*  getting kind of down a rabbit hole here. But listen, CZ did perform a service in this sense, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1722.82s)]
*  okay? SBF claims that $4 billion more was about to come in. I personally don't believe that, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1728.5s)]
*  sounds like bullshit to me. But if it is true, that would have been a bad thing. The more money [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1733.9399999999998s)]
*  that came in to that operation, SBF proved that he was a very poor custodian of customer funds. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1738.58s)]
*  Jason Kuznicki I'm not defending SBF. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1744.34s)]
*  Kyle Sivers No, no, no, I'm just highlighting the language that you use is sort of like, again, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1746.6599999999999s)]
*  part of that establishment elite narrative. And I'm just questioning, you should maybe steal man, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1752.02s)]
*  take a second to just steal man, a more dispassionate view, which is here's a counterparty, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1757.1399999999999s)]
*  okay? Yeah, who, when he left the cap table, was given half cash, half tokens. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1763.06s)]
*  Jason Kuznicki Okay. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1768.5s)]
*  Kyle Sivers And he decided to sell his tokens. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1770.26s)]
*  Jason Kuznicki Yeah, and tweet it publicly and cause a run on the bank. So, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1772.1799999999998s)]
*  it was not a run on the bank. There was no bank. Where's the bank? This run on the bank language, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1777.1399999999999s)]
*  okay, is something this was in the semaphore coverage. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1782.4199999999998s)]
*  Jason Kuznicki He did it publicly. That's my point. So, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1785.86s)]
*  I'll steal man. Okay, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1788.4199999999998s)]
*  Kyle Sivers Okay, these tokens are worthless. I need to liquidate them as fast as possible. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1789.86s)]
*  But why would you do that publicly? Why would you do it privately? [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1793.06s)]
*  Jason Kuznicki Because you're about to move the market. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1796.5s)]
*  Kyle Sivers He wanted to move the market to zero. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1797.62s)]
*  Jason Kuznicki No, he's about to move the market. He's letting people know why. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1799.1399999999999s)]
*  Kyle Sivers But he wanted to kill his competitor, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1801.6999999999998s)]
*  as Chamath was just saying. He wanted to kill his competitor who was trying to kill him. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1803.3799999999999s)]
*  Jason Kuznicki I didn't say he was trying to do that. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1807.3799999999999s)]
*  Kyle Sivers We got to back up here because I think we've done a lot of like 30,000 foot [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1808.34s)]
*  like lessons and like takeaways from this whole thing. But we haven't really established what it [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1813.06s)]
*  is that SBF did wrong. So, I think we need to sort of take a second to unmuddy the waters. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1817.22s)]
*  Jason Kuznicki Okay. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1821.78s)]
*  Kyle Sivers And part of that, I think we should start with this idea of a run on the bank because [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1822.34s)]
*  the press who've been writing puff pieces about SBF, I'd say mainly Semaphore, which he was a big [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1826.82s)]
*  donor to. They've been trying to frame it as a run on the bank. And then that implies that it's [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1832.5s)]
*  not really his fault. It could happen to anybody. Lots of banks have had this problem. Okay, first [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1836.82s)]
*  of all, they're not a bank. Banks actually have the legal right under certain conditions to take [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1840.82s)]
*  customer deposits and loan them out. Okay? They did not. Their terms of use did not allow that, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1846.1s)]
*  as Stephanopoulos pointed out. SBF's answer to that was, well, we had this like margin account [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1851.78s)]
*  program. There were other provisions and other terms of use. But most of the customers who lost [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1856.4199999999998s)]
*  money, the vast majority, did not opt into that program. They never agreed to that. So, that's [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1861.3799999999999s)]
*  point number one. Point number two is, I think we need to look at this language of margin account. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1865.9399999999998s)]
*  Okay. SBF's explanation of how customer money was siphoned off for his own personal use, i.e. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1871.54s)]
*  to Alameda, is that Alameda had a margin account. So, I think we could perform a service here [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1879.86s)]
*  by explaining why it wasn't a margin account. And you guys understand this really well. The way that [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1884.8999999999999s)]
*  a margin account works is the following. Okay? Because I think some of us have them set up with [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1891.94s)]
*  investment banks. You go to an investment bank, say Morgan Stanley, and you over, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1897.86s)]
*  you post collateral. You actually over collateralize. So, for example, you might take $100 million of [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1903.3799999999999s)]
*  stock posted at the investment bank, and then they will let you loan a certain percentage, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1909.3799999999999s)]
*  nowhere near 100%, maybe 50% loan to value. If you have a very, very liquid security, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1915.1399999999999s)]
*  you may get 50% coverage, which means if you posted $100 million, you could get a $50 million [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1921.54s)]
*  loan. But typically- You have $100 million in Amazon stock, you're some Amazon VP, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1927.62s)]
*  you can get $50 million loaned. And if it's a private asset, it's anywhere as high as 30%, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1932.1s)]
*  35%, but typically it's about 25%. My expectation is in a liquid token like this, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1938.26s)]
*  would have basically gotten 5% or 10% coverage ratio at the best of it. And then what happens is, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1944.5s)]
*  you have these maintenance values. So, if all of a sudden, the value of these entities multiplied [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1950.26s)]
*  by that percentage that you're allowed to loan falls below, you have to post money. That's how [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1955.7s)]
*  a margin account works. It's just, there is no free lunch in that. Yes, exactly. Let me just say, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1959.8600000000001s)]
*  quite simply, very simply, what it appears this guy did. He took customer deposits in US dollars. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1965.22s)]
*  He then converted those dollars into some other asset. And he had a mark on that asset, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1973.22s)]
*  let's call it a dollar, a token. And then those dollars were moved to somewhere else. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1979.78s)]
*  No, this is someone transferred in some other token. But what happened? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1985.46s)]
*  We need to finish the explainer around the margin account. Because what SPF did is this, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1991.7s)]
*  he took customer deposits, gave them to himself. No, he took customer deposits in US dollars. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=1997.46s)]
*  They were wired in. He took those dollars out and he put a fake token in. And he called that. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2005.86s)]
*  And therefore, he said the balance sheet is good. But the value of that token, it turns out, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2013.6200000000001s)]
*  isn't a dollar, it's 10 cents. That's right. It was his made up token that he tightly controlled [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2019.38s)]
*  the trading of and artificially prompted the price. And by the way, it wasn't just FTT. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2027.94s)]
*  Yeah. But here's the thing. It wasn't just the fact that his collateral was no good. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2032.5s)]
*  It was also the fact that, and this is from the bankruptcy filing by the Enron trustee guy. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2036.42s)]
*  He specifically said that Alameda, unlike every other margin account on the platform, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2045.54s)]
*  had the auto liquidation provisions turned off. So wait, we have to finish the thought around how [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2050.1800000000003s)]
*  margin works. So like Tomas said, you overpost collateral. And if the value of that collateral [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2055.06s)]
*  goes down or the position, your trading account, the value of that goes down, you either have to [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2060.82s)]
*  post more collateral or they will actually liquidate your collateral to pay off the loan. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2067.38s)]
*  So Morgan Stanley will never lose money on a margin account. Never. The whole point is, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2074.02s)]
*  because they don't make money on it, they loan you the money at a few percent. It's a very cheap [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2079.06s)]
*  loan. Yeah. LIBOR plus. Yeah, exactly. That is not a risk account to them. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2084.9s)]
*  So in the example, let's use an example. In the case of the VP at Amazon, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2090.18s)]
*  who's got a hundred million in Amazon, they have a $50 million loan. If Amazon loses half its value, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2094.66s)]
*  then that triggers the automatic selling of Amazon shares to get it back down to 50% coverage. So now [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2100.2599999999998s)]
*  you have to sell 25 million of Amazon shares if the full 50 million was pulled down to get back [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2106.58s)]
*  down to 25 to 50% leverage. Yes. And they don't wait until like Amazon stock is at the exact level [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2111.8599999999997s)]
*  where now the collateral equals a hundred percent of the loan. They will keep that 50% loan to value [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2118.66s)]
*  and they will liquidate you. And by the way, you can lose your entire amount, right? So, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2123.7s)]
*  this is why trading on margin is so risky is that you can get wiped out very, very quickly with a [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2128.98s)]
*  small move down. Because they are the custodians of that Amazon stock. They are holding it for you [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2134.42s)]
*  now and they have the right to sell it to cover your margin. You're saying that governor, that [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2140.1s)]
*  basic tenant, that basic safety control was turned off by Alameda. And it's even more sinister. Alameda [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2144.74s)]
*  controlled like 90 or 95% of these FTT tokens and was owned by Sam Bankman fraud. So he owned that [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2151.54s)]
*  company. Then he claims he had no operating position in it. What should have happened is with that [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2160.2599999999998s)]
*  collateral is that as the value of their position was going down and or as the value of the collateral [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2165.62s)]
*  was going down, it should have been liquidated to pay off the margin loan. And that did not happen. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2171.94s)]
*  And the reason it didn't happen is that Alameda got a special exception on the platform to turn [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2177.06s)]
*  off auto liquidation. Therefore, it was never a margin account. Even if it was a margin account [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2181.54s)]
*  and FTX somehow misadministered the margin account, it should never have taken other [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2188.7400000000002s)]
*  customers' deposits and used them to pay back that money. What should have happened is if FTX was [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2193.7000000000003s)]
*  going to lose money on a margin account, that would hit the FTX corporate treasury. Okay. And [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2199.06s)]
*  when the FTX corporate treasury ran out, the company files for bankruptcy then. And then all [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2205.7s)]
*  the other customers hold on their account is still there. Their money is there in segregated accounts. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2211.06s)]
*  And in bankruptcy, they get their money back. The idea that a margin account could ever cause [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2216.42s)]
*  another customer to lose money that like whatever that is, that's not a margin. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2221.7s)]
*  There's a great article. This one was a journalist that did his job properly. His [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2226.2599999999998s)]
*  name is David Z. Morris. He wrote an article in CoinDesk that summed up for anybody that's interested [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2230.98s)]
*  all of the actual fraud and all of the crimes that were committed in excruciating detail. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2238.3399999999997s)]
*  And what's so sad about all these interviews and this press tour is if anybody would just read this [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2244.02s)]
*  article, you can construct the right questions to ask this guy just based on this one article. But [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2248.8199999999997s)]
*  the point I wanted to make is that one of the most interesting insights was these guys had lost an [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2253.3s)]
*  enormous amount of money already in calendar year 21. And so this is what's so crazy, Jason, about [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2259.46s)]
*  you using language like rug pulling and like nobody actually trying to be clear. You guys are [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2268.1800000000003s)]
*  giving this guy a hall pass. I'm not giving him a hall pass. If any industrious reporter could have [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2275.38s)]
*  found an employee who said, Wait a minute, we just blew a $3 billion hole in our balance sheet in [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2280.5s)]
*  calendar year 2121. And now we're sitting here at the end of 22. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2285.22s)]
*  It's unbelievable. Hold on, I need to respond. I am not giving him a pass. And for you to blame [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2289.86s)]
*  journalists who are reflecting the crime, and not putting any light on VCs and the capital allocators [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2296.74s)]
*  who made this investment and who did no diligent enough with governance in it is the height of [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2304.34s)]
*  arrogance. Shama. This is not the presses are not doing that. This is the VCs. This is the capital [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2308.82s)]
*  allocators fault. You're blaming the people who are telling the story after the story. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2314.7400000000002s)]
*  They're covering the story. You can't handle the truth. Jason, they're covering the story. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2319.46s)]
*  Listen, can I get in here? Can I get in here? All right, listen, Jason, I will defend you against [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2324.42s)]
*  to ma saying that somehow you're, you know that you're letting SPF off the hook. I know you don't [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2329.38s)]
*  want to let SPF off the hook. However, you are letting the press off the hook. And the reason why [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2335.2200000000003s)]
*  hold on a second. The reason why you're using this inaccurate language like rug pulling and run on [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2340.02s)]
*  the bank when there was no run and there was no bank is because you've been infected by this language [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2345.1400000000003s)]
*  that the media has inserted into the discourse. The media listen, hold on a second, investors may [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2350.42s)]
*  have got it wrong last year. Investors may have got it wrong when they did that last round. But I [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2356.34s)]
*  think investors now understand what's happening. But the media is still covering for SPF by [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2360.82s)]
*  miss explaining what happened. Okay, give me a percentage tax of who's to blame here. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2365.46s)]
*  VCs who invested and didn't set up any governance regulators who did not set rules around crypto [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2371.6200000000003s)]
*  and then three the media. What percentage out of 100% is the investors, the regulators and the press [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2378.5s)]
*  go three numbers? I would say that before the fraud got exposed, one third, one third, one third, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2385.7s)]
*  one third each before the fraud got exposed, but they were all jointly and separately liable. But [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2391.7s)]
*  after the frauds been exposed, no investor is still defending SPF. But I think that the investors who [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2397.62s)]
*  were swindled by him, they feel bad about it. So 30 30 30 is absurd. The press had no way to know [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2403.14s)]
*  the fraud was going on. Just like the VCs. What the money is. Did it. Okay, it doesn't matter. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2410.58s)]
*  Stupid like wasn't your stupid journalist that exposed the fraud at Theranos. He's the guy that [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2415.7s)]
*  went and did all the work. John Kerry, you should be celebrated. Hold on a second. John Kerry, you [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2421.46s)]
*  went and found this thing when nobody else was like, this is perfect. It meets all of our priors. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2426.18s)]
*  Let me finish please. It meets all of our priors. This is great. And John Kerry, hold on. And so [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2432.02s)]
*  John Kerry was like, this doesn't pass the smell test to me. Let me go do some work. And he pulled [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2436.3399999999997s)]
*  one little string. And over the course of 18 months, he exposed the whole bloody thing. So [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2441.46s)]
*  hold on a second. So what is incredible to me is that it was possible to expose this thing before. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2445.46s)]
*  Nobody did. I agree with David. It's about equal responsibility before but afterwards, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2451.06s)]
*  the bulk of the responsibilities now sits with regulators to clean it up and journalists to tell [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2456.26s)]
*  the truth. Okay. And now may I respond to that since you call me stupid? You are delusional. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2460.98s)]
*  Number one, every one of those investors in Theranos could have taken a fucking blood test [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2467.46s)]
*  at two different places like Jean-Louis Gassier did and write a blog post and prove that Theranos [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2473.7s)]
*  didn't work. And they withheld disbelief. Investors putting in $100 million, including Rupert Murdoch, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2479.38s)]
*  didn't even take a fucking blood test or tell one of their diligence teams to do it. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2486.7400000000002s)]
*  The same thing happened here with the investors in FTX. They did zero diligence. They set up [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2490.58s)]
*  zero governance. This was a failure of the investors and the governance for 99% of the [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2496.9s)]
*  problem. And then regulators should have caught it. And the regulators in fact did catch Theranos. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2503.54s)]
*  So you're completely wrong, Chamath. Again, the journalists come in after the fraud is happening. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2507.94s)]
*  The investors and governance is responsible for stopping these things. FTX was a failure of [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2514.42s)]
*  governance and investors. And so was Theranos. The end. You're completely wrong. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2519.06s)]
*  The question is post, post exposure. Why are you guys obsessed with post? How about avoiding [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2524.82s)]
*  these things? You guys are blaming journalists for something that is capital allocator's [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2530.1000000000004s)]
*  responsibility. It is our responsibility to do diligence. It is our responsibility to create a [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2536.82s)]
*  board of directors that checks on Elizabeth Holmes and Sam Banfield fraud. I didn't disagree. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2541.6200000000003s)]
*  Just call me stupid. You just call me stupid for pointing out something that you refuse to accept. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2548.1000000000004s)]
*  What are you talking about? I'm the biggest allocator. I'm the oldest brother. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2553.46s)]
*  You guys are giving a pass to the investors. I'm not doing Fredo. I'm not doing Fredo. You guys [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2561.54s)]
*  are being absurd. This is why people say that we're delusional in this podcast. Don't call him dumb. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2569.3s)]
*  The reason people say we're delusional is that we won't take acceptance of this issue. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2575.14s)]
*  Just call him Wanda, the guy you can't call dumb. He goes berserk. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2579.06s)]
*  No, I'm not going berserk. You guys have a blind spot. Half of the guys are responsible. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2583.38s)]
*  He's like, don't call me dumb. I'm not going to defend any single one of those investors. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2588.5s)]
*  All right, I'm going to calm down. I think that they did a horrible job too. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2594.5s)]
*  It's a great episode. But the reality is, I think that if you think that you can, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2597.3s)]
*  if you, it's your decision to defend the mainstream media, I think that that's fine. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2603.3s)]
*  I'm not defending them. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2607.86s)]
*  No, you are. You said they have no responsibility. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2608.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm blaming the VCs. It's different. The culpability is with the investor class [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2610.1800000000003s)]
*  that has not had proper governance and diligence. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2615.3s)]
*  Jason, how many articles have been written excoriating them? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2618.5s)]
*  Uh, yeah, some. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2622.6600000000003s)]
*  A lot. Sounds like fools. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2623.38s)]
*  Yeah. Show me the Washington Post- [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2626.1s)]
*  No, show me the Washington Post, New York Times that's like digging into that malfeasance or that [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2629.3s)]
*  lack of oversight and holding them accountable in a way that you feel exposes this problem to [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2634.74s)]
*  create change. Well, if we look at Theranos, those people who invested, including Draper [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2640.02s)]
*  and- Show me the examples. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2648.2599999999998s)]
*  Rupert Murdoch, they really went after them for sure. Yeah. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2650.18s)]
*  What about here? [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2653.4599999999996s)]
*  Wall Street Journal, one day ago, Sequoia Capital apologizes to its fund investors for FTX loss. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2655.4599999999996s)]
*  Venture capital firm tells fund investors that- [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2660.4199999999996s)]
*  That's hard hitting. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2662.1s)]
*  It will improve due diligence on future investments after a hundred filling in the [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2662.74s)]
*  loss. They really got them. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2665.54s)]
*  Let me read you- [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2666.4199999999996s)]
*  That's a cover story in the Wall Street Journal. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2667.62s)]
*  Hold on a second. I'm going to read you a sentence from the New York Times coverage of SBF. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2669.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh, I'm not defending that. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2674.18s)]
*  Hold on a second. Sam Banquit-Fried is neither a visionary nor a criminal mastermind. He is a [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2675.62s)]
*  human who made the same poor choice that generations of money managers have made before him. Are you [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2680.3399999999997s)]
*  effing kidding me? No, I'm not defending them. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2685.7799999999997s)]
*  That was the New York Times coverage. Yes, you are. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2686.9799999999996s)]
*  They also said- I am not defending them. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2688.8199999999997s)]
*  That's right. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2690.66s)]
*  He just called Andrew Morgan a suit. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2691.62s)]
*  And then Semaphore, who was on the take, who received millions of dollars in his money, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2693.22s)]
*  said it was a run on the bank. Okay. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2697.46s)]
*  How much did they get? Five million? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2699.46s)]
*  Now, where is their apology? Hold on a second. Where is their apology? Sequoia has apologized. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2700.02s)]
*  Where is their apology? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2705.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh, it has to come. I'm not defending the press. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2706.98s)]
*  Yes, you are. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2709.14s)]
*  I'm just saying- [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2709.46s)]
*  Yes, you are. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2709.94s)]
*  No, I am not. I am literally telling you that the New York Times has been asleep at the wheel- [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2710.5s)]
*  Where's the New York Times apology? The press is always demanding an apology from everybody else. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2715.22s)]
*  The press has done a shit job. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2719.46s)]
*  Hold on a second. The press is so incompetent on this. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2719.86s)]
*  The Twitter spaces yesterday did a better job of trying to ask questions and getting to the truth [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2722.5s)]
*  than a single journalist has done or the collective body of all of journalists. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2727.6200000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. Literally, randos on Twitter spaces did a better job than Sorkin. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2731.3s)]
*  Let me tell you why no one trusts the press, Jason. First of all, they have an agenda. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2735.54s)]
*  I am in agreement. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2739.38s)]
*  But second of all, when they make a mistake, they never admit it. When's the last time they [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2739.54s)]
*  did an apology or retraction? When's the last time they did what Sequoia did? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2743.3s)]
*  I don't know. And they need to apologize. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2748.1s)]
*  You can't even point to it. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2749.7s)]
*  I am in agreement with you on that. But I think we have to first say, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2750.8999999999996s)]
*  and this is where you guys have a blind spot, is what is the responsibility of capital allocators [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2754.5s)]
*  and governance and regulators? I think it's one, two, three. Our industry is responsible [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2759.62s)]
*  for setting up proper governance. The regulators are responsible for making sure that scientific [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2765.7s)]
*  claims are backed up. And then press is a distant third. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2770.8199999999997s)]
*  You know who I think is responsible? SVF. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2774.3399999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2776.8999999999996s)]
*  One, two, and three. And then we can talk about four, five, and six. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2776.98s)]
*  Okay, four, five, and six. Capital allocators, regulators, the press, a distant sixth. I agree. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2780.34s)]
*  Let's go on to China. God, it's so spicy today in here. God, it's so hot. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2786.1s)]
*  I mean, I do think when we attack the mainstream media, Jason feels a little [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2791.46s)]
*  twin tinge of insecurity and illegitimacy because he were a journalist. My personal [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2795.14s)]
*  perception is I think that you have an incredibly romantic view of the craft as you practiced it [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2800.82s)]
*  back then, which I think was full of integrity. I think that you don't adequately realize how [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2810.5800000000004s)]
*  massively the industry has changed in the last 20 years since you've become a journalist. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2818.5800000000004s)]
*  I realize it more than you do. I fully realize that the media has absolutely become biased. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2821.3s)]
*  Are they corrupt? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2826.26s)]
*  And they have lost, in some cases, yes. I mean, if you're taking money- [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2826.5800000000004s)]
*  Are they blinded? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2830.66s)]
*  ... from SBS and then giving him- [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2831.2999999999997s)]
*  Are they biased? [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2832.5s)]
*  They are corrupt if they're taking money from SBS and then giving him kid glove coverage. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2833.3799999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. That is the definition of corruption in my mind. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2837.8599999999997s)]
*  What is it called when you don't take money necessarily like the New York Times and still [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2840.58s)]
*  treat them with kid gloves? What is that? [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2844.2599999999998s)]
*  It is extreme bias. And the New York Times became extremely biased. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2845.54s)]
*  Why do you think that bias exists? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2848.42s)]
*  They were always left leaning, but I can tell you why. They, when Trump came in, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2851.7799999999997s)]
*  a generation of new journalists became activist journalists. They didn't want to tell stories and [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2857.78s)]
*  take it straight down the middle and let the facts tell the story and let the audience make their [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2863.1400000000003s)]
*  own decision. They felt that existential risk when Trump came into office, they got Trump [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2866.5800000000004s)]
*  derangement syndrome. They picked a side like MSNBC and Fox did. And the business model became, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2871.1400000000003s)]
*  for the New York Times, pick a side and get the subscribers. It was a deliberate, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2876.82s)]
*  cynical choice on the New York Times part to go full MSNBC for full Fox, the two extremes in [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2882.26s)]
*  mainstream media in order to get the subs. And they literally rallied the troops there [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2888.34s)]
*  to do anti-tech, anti-Trump coverage. And they became activists. And when journalists become [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2892.98s)]
*  activists, they are no longer journalists, they're activists or commentators. And that's the problem. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2899.2200000000003s)]
*  It's being presented as journalism when in fact it's activism. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2904.34s)]
*  So you're right. So just shout out to Matt Taibbi, who just did a monk debate. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2908.02s)]
*  Yeah. On this very topic. And he has a great, great substack basically saying what you're saying, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2914.34s)]
*  Jason. And the best quote is the story is no longer the boss. Instead we sell narrative. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2919.06s)]
*  He's a lifelong journalist whose father was a lifelong journalist. And he understands the [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2924.9s)]
*  way the business has changed. And it's like what you're saying. And this is why independent media, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2929.06s)]
*  whether it's substacks, whether it's call in shows, whether it's all in podcasts or other [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2933.62s)]
*  podcasts, Joe Rogan, Sam Harris, whoever it is, independent voices are now what consumers are [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2938.58s)]
*  seeking out because they can sense the bias. They know Rachel Maddow and Tucker have an axe to grind [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2944.9s)]
*  and they're left and right. They didn't expect the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2950.66s)]
*  Journal to, you know, they knew they were leaning. They didn't expect them to pick a side. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2955.2999999999997s)]
*  Do you think we should cancel if folks do you think folks are better off keeping their New [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2959.86s)]
*  York Times subscription or replacing that New York Times subscription with a basket of substacks? [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2964.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, you answered your own question. It's the latter. I think you're on your own as a consumer [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2971.38s)]
*  now, you're going to have to and I think this podcast and the nuance we have to shout out to [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2975.46s)]
*  Freiburg for nuance. What we've done on this podcast is to explain to people [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2980.5s)]
*  Freiburg is not the only one with nuance. Nobody would describe David Sacks with the word [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2986.1s)]
*  he's a nuanced department on this podcast. What am I 100%? He is, but you wouldn't know that [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2991.06s)]
*  because you leave when science department. Okay. Sometimes new bombs. All right. I'm the truth [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=2995.2999999999997s)]
*  department. Consumers need to become extremely literate and they have to do their own search for [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3000.2599999999998s)]
*  truth in today's age. They don't, they shouldn't trust New York Times. They shouldn't trust us. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3007.7799999999997s)]
*  They should trust themselves. They shouldn't trust necessarily the CDC or, you know, the [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3011.78s)]
*  World Health Organization. They should trust themselves and come up with their own process [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3016.98s)]
*  for figuring out the truth in the middle of this mess. By the way, this is a good reflection on [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3020.82s)]
*  what's happened with the rest of media with respect to the creator class, where it used to be the movie [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3026.26s)]
*  studios and, you know, a handful of kind of aggregated creators that made all of the content, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3033.3s)]
*  the record labels and now, you know, independent artists, independent producers, independent [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3038.42s)]
*  creators, and now independent journalists are going to become the bulk of volume that's going [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3043.2200000000003s)]
*  to be consumed. It's just a different consumption model, but we've already seen it happen with [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3048.34s)]
*  music. We saw it happen with movies and we've seen this disruption happen across all of these [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3052.1800000000003s)]
*  other media classes. Journalism and what we call the press is very likely going to be kind of that [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3055.86s)]
*  next layer of disruption. I would trust having a conversation with you about science topics [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3062.1s)]
*  over reading a science article. 100%. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3067.62s)]
*  You know, in the New York Times or Wall Street Journal, if I'm being honest, I would much [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3070.1s)]
*  prefer to talk to you about it. And if it was markets, I'd rather talk to Schmott than if it [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3073.94s)]
*  was SaaS, I would talk to Saks or operating a company. Speaking of operating a company. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3077.14s)]
*  Or politics. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3082.1s)]
*  We'll see. We'll see. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3088.1s)]
*  But I think it's about having unique insight, insight, right? Like, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3090.02s)]
*  that wasn't the case. And what's interesting is that the people who are the professionals [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3094.02s)]
*  that have the knowledge and the touch points are also becoming journalists in the sense that [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3097.46s)]
*  they're also becoming speakers of their truth. Right. And I think Twitter is a good enabling [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3102.1800000000003s)]
*  platform for this. We see it on YouTube where like scientists are putting out their own videos [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3107.1400000000003s)]
*  or market actors, like people that are traders in the market go out and they put out their own [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3112.1800000000003s)]
*  videos and they put out their own podcast. And I think we're probably a good reflection of that. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3116.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3120.98s)]
*  In the sense that like we are the actors in the market and we're not just the independent observer [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3121.54s)]
*  that has kind of a surface level view. We have the depth to be able to talk about the things that we [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3126.98s)]
*  choose to talk about. And I think that's where consumers find value and will continue to find [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3131.86s)]
*  value in terms of who the journalist or speaker is that they're going to start to trust for their [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3136.34s)]
*  information. I had that. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3140.42s)]
*  I saw that interview you did with Newcomer. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3142.34s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3145.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3146.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I saw that coverage. I mean, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3146.74s)]
*  he speaks a lot about this phenomenon of going direct and of course he's against it. Now, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3151.06s)]
*  he interprets going direct as an attempt by newsmakers to avoid answering tough questions [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3156.1800000000003s)]
*  or take tough questions. I think that's ridiculous because for example, I go on CNBC all the time. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3163.54s)]
*  I go on Emily Ching and Bloomberg all the time. I submit to like really tough questions. I actually [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3169.54s)]
*  like those sort of sparring sessions. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3175.7000000000003s)]
*  I did hard talk this week. Have you ever done that? [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3178.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. So that's not what's going on here. I think what's going on is we have expertise. We [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3180.66s)]
*  want to communicate them and we do feel like the media has become a very unreliable narrator. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3186.8199999999997s)]
*  There is too much bias and sloppiness. Not all of it is agenda. Some of it's just pure sloppiness [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3192.1s)]
*  and there's no reason why we shouldn't go direct and people want to hear from us. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3197.7799999999997s)]
*  The audience wants to hear from us. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3202.1s)]
*  Same for, look at Draymond. Look at Draymond and the success he's had with his podcast. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3203.7799999999997s)]
*  No basketball player has ever gone direct and created content like Draymond's created [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3207.86s)]
*  and has totally changed the game. He was so clear. He's like, we are, I am the media now. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3212.42s)]
*  JJ Reddit, you know, Old Man and the Three. Amazing podcast. I was going to tell you guys [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3218.26s)]
*  a story. I was in the Middle East last week or this week, sorry. I had this crazy experience [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3222.82s)]
*  where I was trying to understand what was going on in China. I started on CNN and the whole thing [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3229.2200000000003s)]
*  was the propaganda machine around a democratic revolt, you know, pushing for democracy and [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3235.94s)]
*  trying to depose Xi. Then I moved to Al-Arabiya. So one channel up, I went from channel 10 to [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3242.58s)]
*  channel 11. And instead what they were actually doing was interviewing people on the ground. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3248.82s)]
*  And what they were talking about was literally how these PCR tests have become far too burdensome [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3254.7400000000002s)]
*  and they just wanted it to end and more reasonable restrictions to get in and out of quarantine. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3260.82s)]
*  Then I went from there to BBC. And in BBC, they had a China scholar who was talking about how [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3265.62s)]
*  for decades, actually, the Communist Party supports local level protests and demonstrations [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3272.2599999999998s)]
*  because they've realized that it is a part of their political system to make sure that people [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3277.94s)]
*  feel like they have a say. And I was like, taking a step back and I'm like, if you listen to the [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3283.54s)]
*  US narrative and even Jason, like in our group chat, people formenting for like revolution, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3288.42s)]
*  and this is Tiananmen 2.0. And I'm like, well, I'm reading two other channels that tell us a [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3293.3s)]
*  completely different set of things. And I just thought, man, people just really fit the data. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3299.38s)]
*  Such a good point. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3304.5s)]
*  To fit their bias. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3305.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, we are projecting. We want to see a revolution in China. The people in China [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3306.6600000000003s)]
*  want to have their lives back. Well, I would love to see more democracy in the world. Yes, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3310.7400000000002s)]
*  guilty as charged. I would like to see people be more free in the world. Dictator. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3314.82s)]
*  I think most people just want to improve their condition. And I don't think people are as tied [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3321.3s)]
*  up on the philosophy of the government as they are about improving their condition. And as long as [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3325.6200000000003s)]
*  their condition is improving, they're willing to put up with any form of government. And history [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3330.1000000000004s)]
*  shows that by the way, the conditions in China have improved better than everybody's in the last [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3334.26s)]
*  better than anyone in history people out of abject poverty. And that's the great success of [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3338.42s)]
*  engagement. Isolationism would not have created that amazing outcome. 500 million people going [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3345.46s)]
*  out of abject- [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3353.06s)]
*  You're referring to- [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3353.62s)]
*  To Apple building factories. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3354.5s)]
*  You're saying- [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3356.42s)]
*  Apple building factories is what I'm referring to. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3356.66s)]
*  Oh, okay, fine. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3358.58s)]
*  Instead of you guys. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3359.78s)]
*  If they want to build something over there, I guess that's better than us throwing out open [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3360.1s)]
*  our markets and giving China MFN status to destroy American manufacturing and build up [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3363.2200000000003s)]
*  their economy so they can become a peer competitor to the United States. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3369.78s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, this is the balance of engagement is that if you engage too much, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3373.38s)]
*  you give everything up. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3377.2200000000003s)]
*  Sachs, which of the current Republican agenda do you disagree with most strongly? Just as an aside. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3379.1400000000003s)]
*  Well, most Republicans are in favor of our Ukraine policy, this sort of unlimited appropriation [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3387.1400000000003s)]
*  of weapons and aid to them. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3393.7000000000003s)]
*  Don't you disagree with immigration policy of Republicans and Democrats? [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3395.38s)]
*  Well, I have a more nuanced position on immigration, which is I think we need to [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3398.42s)]
*  have a border. It can't be just like an open border, which is the de facto policy we have [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3402.02s)]
*  now. But at the same time, I do think that we should have H1B visas and we want to, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3406.98s)]
*  like Jamasa, we want to be an all-star team for the world. We want to have the best people [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3411.86s)]
*  want to come here. So there's a balance. It's a balance. And then, look, I think that I was [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3414.74s)]
*  happy to see the marriage equality bill finally passed the Senate. Yes, they did get about a dozen- [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3419.54s)]
*  12 Republicans voted for it. That's great. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3424.74s)]
*  So that's great. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3426.82s)]
*  Awesome. Yeah. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3427.38s)]
*  But that's not the majority, unfortunately. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3428.34s)]
*  You know, look, on what I would categorize as the old social issues, you know, like gay marriage, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3431.2200000000003s)]
*  like cannabis legalization, I was on the liberal side. Yeah. I don't think, you know, banning [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3438.34s)]
*  abortion entirely, a total abolition is going to work for this country. I think Republicans will [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3444.1000000000004s)]
*  lose elections if they insist on that. And I think they're getting that message. So, yeah, I mean, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3449.46s)]
*  look, I think that I've always considered myself to be pretty centrist. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3455.2200000000003s)]
*  And so you're not a globalist. You don't believe in open global markets with the U.S. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3459.86s)]
*  In general, I understand the benefits of free trade. And I don't think we should be isolationist [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3465.22s)]
*  with respect to trade. I don't think that we can be a successful country if we are, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3470.9s)]
*  we isolate our economy. So I do want to trade. However, with China in particular, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3476.18s)]
*  I think we made a mistake in throwing open our markets to their products, giving them MFN status [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3481.86s)]
*  while- [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3487.86s)]
*  Most favored nation. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3488.58s)]
*  Yes, enriching them to the point where they became a peer competitor of the United States. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3489.6200000000003s)]
*  Now, look, I understand why we made that mistake 20 years ago, because everybody thought the theory [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3493.94s)]
*  was that if we helped China become rich, that China would inevitably become more democratic, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3499.46s)]
*  and they'd be filled with gratitude towards the United States, and it'd actually become [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3504.98s)]
*  more hospitable towards us, more westernized. And I think that theory has just proven to be [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3509.06s)]
*  wrong. I mean, they have not- [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3514.66s)]
*  Or it's going very slowly, one or the other. Let's own our clips here. Here is [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3515.94s)]
*  Shemat's prediction from episode 61. And we'll see you on the other side of this quick clip. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3520.98s)]
*  My worldwide biggest political winner for 2022 is Xi Jinping. I think this guy is, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3525.94s)]
*  he's firing on all cylinders, and he is basically ascendant. So 2022 marks the first year where [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3535.94s)]
*  he's essentially really ruler for life. And so I don't think we really know what he's capable [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3544.02s)]
*  of and what he's going to do. And so that's just going to play out. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3548.98s)]
*  You think he's the biggest political winner, really? [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3551.38s)]
*  Oh my god, I think it's going to be a- he's going to run roughshod, not just domestically, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3553.38s)]
*  but also internationally, because you have to remember, he controls so much of the critical [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3558.74s)]
*  supply chain that the western world needs to be- [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3563.62s)]
*  I think you're completely wrong. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3566.34s)]
*  I think you're completely wrong. I think he's losing his power. He's scared. That's why he [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3568.2599999999998s)]
*  took out all these CEOs. He's consolidating power because he fears that they're going to [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3571.86s)]
*  win too big and then displace him. And he has massive real estate problems over there that [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3577.1400000000003s)]
*  could blow up at any moment in time. He could face a civil war there. I think he's totally [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3582.26s)]
*  isolating himself. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3585.7000000000003s)]
*  Civil war? They don't even have guns. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3586.7400000000002s)]
*  Every major country is removing their factories and removing this dependency. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3588.1s)]
*  But they don't even have any guns there. What are you talking about? What do they get a riot with? [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3591.38s)]
*  Did you not see Tiananmen Square? Did you not see the riots in Hong Kong? Are you not paying [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3596.82s)]
*  attention, Shemoth? There's been many riots in China. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3600.66s)]
*  Jason, those were crushed. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3603.14s)]
*  I'm not saying they will be crushed, but he still will have massive amounts of, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3606.18s)]
*  I believe, protests. And yeah, he'll have to kill people. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3611.06s)]
*  I think the bigger risk is that China gets better for Xi Jinping, but worse for everybody else in [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3613.54s)]
*  China. It's already worse for all the billionaires over there. It's worse for the tech industry. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3619.3799999999997s)]
*  You've now got Evergrande, that whole gigantic debt implosion. I think there could be [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3624.3399999999997s)]
*  contagion from China next year. I don't think Xi is going to lose his grip in any way. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3630.18s)]
*  But I'm not sure China is going to have a good year next year. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3635.7s)]
*  Wow. Nailed it. I think all three of us kind of got this right. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3639.46s)]
*  What are you talking about? You got none of it right. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3642.8199999999997s)]
*  I said there were going to be riots and they're going to have a recession. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3645.14s)]
*  Jason, let's be honest. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3649.54s)]
*  And you said that they'll be squashed. That's exactly what happened. Both things happened. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3650.4199999999996s)]
*  I actually think I have a pretty decent ability to steal man, pretty concretely, the details. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3654.02s)]
*  I think that at best when it comes to things like democracy and your belief in US exceptionalism [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3659.06s)]
*  and a specific political worldview, at best you straw man. And I think that you get very biased [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3664.74s)]
*  without seeing the forest from the trees. The reason I said that is not because I'm like, [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3669.46s)]
*  you know, some huge Xi supporter. I'm just trying to steal man. What happens when one individual [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3674.1s)]
*  person gets anointed leader for life of 1.3 billion people that then controls 20% of the world's GDP. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3679.2999999999997s)]
*  There is no other single human being as powerful as him as of this month. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3688.26s)]
*  Can I just say that this show, this show is going to become insufferable if every time you sort of [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3696.42s)]
*  said something in the past that was sort of correct, we're going to have to replay it. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3702.0200000000004s)]
*  I was actually playing that one for you, Saks. I think you're the one who nailed it. I was giving, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3708.42s)]
*  that was a softball to you. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3712.34s)]
*  I know it every week, J Cal. All right. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3713.5400000000004s)]
*  This show is going to slow down if we play every clip that I got right. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3715.7s)]
*  You guys are asking to pull clips all the time. I just pulled one clip about China where you nailed [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3718.5s)]
*  it. No, no, no. Look, I think like and also look what he did. The king of pull a clip. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3722.74s)]
*  The Evergrande thing. Look what he did this week. They said, okay, you know what, the real [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3726.98s)]
*  estate industry can now issue secondary stock sales, raise equity and equitize themselves. So [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3730.98s)]
*  they're going to find a soft landing for the equity part of for the real estate industry in China. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3736.58s)]
*  And now they're reopening. So I don't know. I mean, like, I'm not sure what we're supposed [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3741.54s)]
*  to comment. What I what I will stand by is what I said, which is, I don't think we have a very [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3745.78s)]
*  clear view about what's going on, what the substance of these protests are, and what people [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3750.9s)]
*  actually want. If you're only consuming US media. And so if you find a way to get a diet from a [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3755.94s)]
*  bunch of different sources all around the world, you may get a better sense. I had an accidental [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3762.82s)]
*  window into that by being in a completely different part of the world this past week. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3767.94s)]
*  Freeburg, any final thoughts on China? And what's going on there before we move on to chat GPT? [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3771.7000000000003s)]
*  Your favorite story? I think one of the things we often miss is that China, the CCP does have [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3777.78s)]
*  their hand on the throttle, like they throttle up and down. We always think that it's a linear line, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3785.3s)]
*  and that it's super dogmatic and fixed. But there's certainly responsiveness and the [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3793.86s)]
*  release of the lockdowns in Guangzhou and Beijing this week seems to have been [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3798.5s)]
*  a pretty good indication that when things do get when things when the tides do do change, [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3802.9s)]
*  leadership there seems to respond not always but enough to kind of keep things going. So [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3809.06s)]
*  should they reopen? I think it's 60% of the population or so is vaccinated [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3814.82s)]
*  with obviously vaccines that maybe aren't as don't have the same efficacy as the ones here [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3819.14s)]
*  in the United States. Do you think they should open up and just let it rip? Or do you think they [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3824.58s)]
*  should still try to maintain the zero COVID policy? Because that is the debate right now. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3829.46s)]
*  What's the objective? Because obviously, well, from the objective of economic growth, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3835.62s)]
*  they need to open up and they need to keep their economy working and they need to keep their labor [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3840.26s)]
*  force engaged, or else they're going to continue to suffer. So if economic growth [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3843.62s)]
*  is the objective, they need to open up, right? If the long term health cost of the nation [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3849.62s)]
*  balanced again, against that is the calculus that they're kind of weighing, there's probably some [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3856.1s)]
*  more nuance to that. And certainly, my understanding is there may be a precedent setting, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3861.54s)]
*  which is, hey, we've said that it's a zero COVID policy, therefore, we have to hold strict to it, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3870.9s)]
*  hold toe the line. Else, it looks like we're weak. And so there's also this, you know, maintaining [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3875.54s)]
*  the authority of the CCP objective. So there's a lot of maybe competing objectives right now. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3881.94s)]
*  Certainly don't have a sense of how they're weighing them all. But I think that once all [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3887.78s)]
*  those videos came out this week, you guys saw them, but people were screaming, there was an [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3892.42s)]
*  apartment on fire with the doors were locked with steel beams on the on the base of the building, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3896.9s)]
*  at least that's what the video said. I don't know how much truth there is to that. But that's what [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3901.7000000000003s)]
*  was said. And clearly, people are extremely distraught and unhappy with the conditions of [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3905.54s)]
*  the lockdown. At some point enough peace people with enough loud voices. You know, something's [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3910.26s)]
*  going to change. I mean, let's just remember, like the bargain that struck in that country, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3918.1s)]

*  their government so long as their conditions continue to improve. And there's a bargain, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3930.66s)]
*  there's some bargain that struck. And as soon as that bargain starts to go south for for the [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3935.62s)]
*  citizenry, then that that that governing entity is at risk. And I think that that's what we sort [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3941.46s)]
*  of started to see this week was the conditions are getting far, far worse and far less livable [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3947.3s)]

*  what is actually going on there. But one explanation could actually be that, in the absence of enough [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3979.14s)]
*  hospital infrastructure and ventilators, and a bunch of these other things, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3986.1s)]
*  they had to take a pretty severe approach to this disease. I don't know what they know or didn't [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3990.1s)]
*  know. Maybe they understood, you know, the virulence of it, maybe that they have slightly [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=3998.02s)]
*  different aging characteristics of their population, maybe they genetically responded to [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4004.18s)]
*  the SARS CoV 2 virus. I don't know any of these things enough to tell you, Jason. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4008.1s)]
*  Jason Bahl Yeah, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4012.9s)]
*  but the reality is what Friedberg says is right, which is that you cannot grow an economy if people [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4013.78s)]
*  are inside locked in their apartments. And it looks like they have decided that that's coming [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4018.58s)]
*  to an end and they're going to, you know, deconstruct all of these things. So, you know, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4024.5s)]
*  the Chinese growth engine is coming back. And I think that that's going to be an important [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4031.14s)]
*  factor economically that we're going to have to figure out. Because it's going to have a huge [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4037.14s)]

*  their policy a bit. Any final thoughts here? [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4058.1s)]
*  Jason Bahl Well, Jake, I'm just surprised to hear that you have a problem with their lockdown [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4060.2599999999998s)]
*  policy over there. Because aren't they just implementing democratic party orthodoxy? [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4064.98s)]
*  I mean, isn't this the policy that Tony Fauci and Barbara Ferrer, you know, that all the health [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4070.18s)]
*  experts- Michael S. Scott [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4076.18s)]
*  I was not in favor of lockdowns. What are you talking about? You're the one who had your mask [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4076.74s)]
*  and had ventilators day one. Jason Bahl [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4079.7s)]
*  Isn't this the lockdown policy? Hold on. Because you'll defend the democratic party. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4081.2999999999997s)]
*  Michael S. Scott I'm just asking a question as the moderator. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4086.3399999999997s)]
*  Jason Bahl Isn't this basically- [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4088.8199999999997s)]
*  Michael S. Scott Why am I getting a stray? [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4090.3399999999997s)]
*  Jason Bahl Isn't this what Gavin Newsom- [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4091.7s)]
*  Michael S. Scott Don't deflect, Jake, I'll answer the question. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4092.98s)]
*  Jason Bahl Yes. Hold on. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4094.74s)]
*  Michael S. Scott I'm not in favor of lockdowns. I was in favor of if people wanted to stay home, [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4095.62s)]
*  stay home. And then if people wanted to go out and take the risk, take the risk. I was always in- [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4101.0599999999995s)]
*  Jason Bahl But Jake, isn't this what Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan and Gavin Newsom in [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4104.179999999999s)]
*  California subscribed to the idea that the way to fight COVID was through lockdowns. Now, yes, [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4109.14s)]
*  Newsom had 10 pages of exceptions for his political donors. And he didn't use the police [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4115.3s)]
*  to lock people in apartment buildings. He may have wanted to, but they didn't actually do that. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4120.18s)]
*  But can you really tell me that this lockdown policy has been disavowed by people like Fauci [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4124.820000000001s)]
*  or by the health authorities like the Barbara Ferreres of this world? They still subscribe [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4131.14s)]
*  to this view. Michael S. Scott [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4136.02s)]
*  Do they? Really? Is anybody doing lockdowns? [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4136.900000000001s)]
*  Jason Bahl Show me. Well, they're not able to do it. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4139.0599999999995s)]
*  Because no one agrees anymore. But tell me where anybody, tell me where any of the health experts [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4141.38s)]
*  who said that lockdowns were the correct response have repented and disavowed that view. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4147.3s)]
*  Michael S. Scott Yeah, I don't know. I haven't been tracking their [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4151.139999999999s)]
*  maya copas. You yourself were in favor of lockdowns for a period of time. Yes, you were. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4155.46s)]
*  Jason Bahl No. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4160.34s)]
*  Michael S. Scott You absolutely were. I'll pull the tape for the next episode. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4160.9s)]
*  Jason Bahl No, I was in favor of a mass mandate. No, it's not true. I was in favor of a mass mandate. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4162.42s)]
*  And I said the mass mandate was the alternative to lockdowns. I was saying that by May of 2020. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4166.82s)]
*  Michael S. Scott All right, listen, let's move on to the next [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4172.42s)]
*  thing. I don't represent I'm an independent. I don't represent the Democratic Party. I don't [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4174.5s)]
*  represent Fauci. No, you represent mainstream media. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4178.34s)]
*  Jason Bahl I do not represent mainstream media. You just said I was an old school [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4181.86s)]
*  journalist who's mortified with where it is today. I'm giving you a hard time. I thought your [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4185.299999999999s)]
*  explanation was fabulous. Thank you. Thank you. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4189.94s)]
*  Jason Bahl Obviously, Jake, I'm giving you a hard time too. I know that you were not a big [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4192.42s)]
*  lockdown proponent. But you understand the point I was making. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4196.02s)]
*  Michael S. Scott I do understand your point. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4198.580000000001s)]
*  Jason Bahl There were a lot of proponents in the US. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4199.38s)]
*  Michael S. Scott Let's stop making me the Democratic spokesperson. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4200.820000000001s)]
*  Jason Bahl I'm feeling a lot better after my beer. Let's talk about OpenAI. Come on. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4203.9400000000005s)]
*  Michael S. Scott All right, so listen, let's talk about OpenAI. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4208.9800000000005s)]
*  Michael S. Scott All right. OpenAI is a company that builds [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4211.700000000001s)]
*  artificial intelligence software and platforms. They have one platform called GPT. It is on its [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4218.580000000001s)]
*  third version as part of GPT-3. They created chat GPT, which is a chat interface where you [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4224.98s)]
*  can ask questions to AI. The results are nothing short of stunning when they hit. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4232.099999999999s)]
*  Some of them are a little bit mixed. But Freeberg has spent the last 48 hours [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4238.099999999999s)]
*  drinking white Russians with oatly milk and playing with chat GPT, including his question [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4244.339999999999s)]
*  to the chat GPT, which was write a script of Chamath, Sachs and J. Cal talking about the future [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4251.3s)]
*  of AI in the style of a Quentin Tarantino movie. And I have to say, it was pretty great. The result. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4257.62s)]
*  Go ahead, Freeberg, tell us what you discovered. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4265.14s)]
*  Freeberg I think you guys should read this real quick. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4267.62s)]
*  We can cut it out if it's stupid. But okay, actually read the script. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4269.14s)]
*  Jason Bahl I don't think I got the Quentin Tarantino part right. I mean, [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4272.5s)]
*  I think it was like impressive, but there's no f-bombs. There's no like Tarantino-esque dialogue. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4275.22s)]
*  By the way, they excluded all of that from OpenAI. They took out all cursing and violent, [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4279.7s)]
*  cussing and violence from OpenAI. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4284.02s)]
*  Freeberg That explains it. Because if this was a Tarantino script, [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4285.54s)]
*  there would be some choice language in here. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4287.94s)]
*  Jason Bahl Totally. But it's interesting. It's like the PG Tarantino script. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4289.38s)]
*  Freeberg It is. Okay. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4292.5s)]
*  Jason Bahl With no cussing, no violence, no sex. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4292.9800000000005s)]
*  Freeberg You do the narrative. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4294.82s)]
*  Jason Bahl Yeah, you do the narrative. Go ahead. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4296.34s)]
*  The scene opens on Chamath Palihapitiya, David Sachs and Jason Calacanis sitting at a dimly lit [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4303.06s)]
*  table in a smoky bar. A bottle of whiskey sits in the center of the table, half empty. Chamath [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4308.34s)]
*  leaning forward, his eyes intense. So what do you guys think about this chat GPT thing? [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4313.62s)]
*  David Sachs takes a sip of his drink. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4319.38s)]
*  Jason Bahl It's impressive, no doubt about it. A large language model trained by OpenAI that can [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4321.06s)]
*  generate human-like text in a variety of styles and formats. It's a game changer. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4325.62s)]
*  Freeberg Jason nods. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4329.06s)]
*  Jason Bahl Definitely. It's one of the most advanced AI systems we've seen to date. It's [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4330.5s)]
*  going to have a huge impact on the way we use and interact with AI. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4335.14s)]
*  Freeberg Chamath frowns. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4338.740000000001s)]
*  Chamath Palihapitiya That's what I'm worried about. With a technology like this, the possibilities [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4340.34s)]
*  are endless, but so are the potential dangers. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4344.58s)]
*  Freeberg Sachs leans back in his chair. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4346.900000000001s)]
*  Jason Bahl Oh, come on Chamath, you're not still stuck on that whole AI is going to kill us all [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4349.14s)]
*  thing, are you? [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4353.46s)]
*  Freeberg Chamath leans forward again, his voice low and serious. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4354.1s)]
*  Chamath Palihapitiya Look, I'm not saying that chat GPT is going to turn into Skynet overnight, [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4357.700000000001s)]
*  but we need to be careful about the way we develop and deploy AI. We need to make sure [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4364.26s)]
*  that we're using it for good and not just for our own gain. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4369.7s)]
*  Freeberg Jason J. Cal nods. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4372.98s)]
*  Jason Bahl I agree. We need to make sure that we're responsible in the way we use AI, and that [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4375.3s)]
*  includes making sure it's accessible and affordable to everyone, not just a select few. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4380.18s)]
*  Freeberg Chamath with a dirty smirk. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4385.14s)]
*  Jason Bahl And let's not forget about the importance of regulation. We need to make sure [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4387.54s)]
*  that we have the right laws in place to prevent the misuse of AI. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4392.82s)]
*  Jason Bahl The director is calling cut. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4397.219999999999s)]
*  Freeberg Chamath Cut, that's it. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4399.7s)]

*  Freeberg Chamath Not that far off. I mean, it's 60% of the way there. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4404.099999999999s)]

*  Freeberg Chamath All you have to do is put in a Biden for Sachs. If you blame Biden, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4408.66s)]

*  Jason Bahl Let me tell you guys something stunning about this platform. So this is GPT 3.5, [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4412.98s)]
*  which is an interim model to the what people are saying is the long awaited GPT 4.0 model, [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4419.06s)]
*  which I think they announced in 2020, and has been in development for some time. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4425.54s)]
*  So the model, this GPT 3.5 model was trained in three steps. They do a great job explaining [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4430.34s)]
*  it on the OpenAI blog site, where they collect some data. And then there's a supervised model, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4435.9400000000005s)]
*  meaning that there are humans that are involved in tagging. And then the model kind of learns [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4443.14s)]
*  from that system. Then you ask the model questions, you get output, and then humans rank the output. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4448.179999999999s)]
*  And so the model learns through that ranking system. And then there's kind of this third [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4453.78s)]
*  optimization thing, and then it's fine tuned. So the model itself has several steps of kind of [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4457.54s)]
*  human involvement and kind of it sources its own data and builds it. You know what's incredible [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4463.7s)]
*  about this model? The total size of the software package that runs the model is about 100 gigabytes. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4469.299999999999s)]
*  Isn't that amazing? Like, you could fit this model on probably what 20% of the storage space [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4475.22s)]
*  on your iPhone. And you could run this thing and you could probably just talk to it for the rest [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4481.06s)]
*  of your life. And it's really kind of an incredible milestone. But I think what was so stunning to me [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4484.820000000001s)]
*  about this, I know you guys are probably expecting something to be said like this, but you could see [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4491.38s)]
*  so many human knowledge worker roles and functions being replaced by this extraordinary [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4498.42s)]
*  interface. So kids can do homework, that's easy. Software engineers can get their code [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4506.42s)]
*  optimized and can get their code written for them. There's great examples of how [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4511.3s)]
*  software code has been written by this interface. You could see real estate insurance salespeople [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4514.82s)]
*  being replaced by some sort of software like this. Copywriters make me 100 versions of a commercial [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4522.18s)]
*  or an ad. Customer support completely replaced. If you guys remember, there were these automated [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4530.66s)]
*  customer support companies that started two decades ago. There was this great flurry. All BPO [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4536.26s)]
*  businesses were all about lower cost human labor. Now the cost of human labor goes to zero. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4542.58s)]
*  My prediction, which is so everyone's got the obvious prediction, which is there's going to be [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4547.22s)]
*  100,000 startups that are going to emerge. I mean, this is kind of like this moment where the internet [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4551.7s)]
*  came along and everyone's like, this changes everything. I do think everyone thinks and feels [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4555.94s)]
*  that. So the obvious next step is a bubble will form. So I ask a technical question though, [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4559.86s)]
*  Freeberg and then Chamath. You're probably thinking the same thing. Let me just finish my market [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4565.38s)]
*  prediction and then we'll do this. But I think because everyone's so hyped about this and we [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4569.7s)]
*  all know this, all the VC attention, all the investor attention is shifting to this capability. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4573.54s)]
*  And how do you apply this sort of capability across all of these different industries and all [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4578.66s)]
*  these different applications? And as a result, my guess is the next hype cycle, the next bubble [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4582.98s)]
*  cycle in Silicon Valley will absolutely be this generative AI business. Okay. This is a little [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4587.38s)]
*  technical, but how would it know the difference between like, why, oh, you are, and you are, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4593.38s)]
*  it, when it is processing natural language, if you were to do like your anus or your anus, [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4599.94s)]
*  how would that Freeberg, how would it know the difference between your anus and your space anus? [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4606.0199999999995s)]
*  It'll, it'll learn that, you know, it's a joke. It was a joke about your [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4611.459999999999s)]
*  anus. I think the AI probably would have made a better joke than that. It would have made a better [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4616.339999999999s)]
*  joke for sure. So somebody did a group chat and said, can I just like J Cal and they were terrible. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4621.459999999999s)]
*  So I have to have a job for another year. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4626.58s)]
*  Have LSE AI to pretend you're the all in pod besties telling Uranus jokes. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4627.86s)]
*  Sorry, let me just say one more thing about this open AI thing. I do think that the biggest and [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4634.74s)]
*  most interesting thing to think about is how this will disrupt the search box. The search, [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4638.82s)]
*  you know, the way search works at Google, you know, and the internet search is there are these [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4646.74s)]
*  kind of servers, these web crawlers that go out and gather data. Some of the structured data [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4652.0199999999995s)]
*  feeds and some of them are just crawlers. And then that data is indexed or in the structured way, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4656.34s)]
*  it's kind of made available for serving directly on the search page. And so much of that is indexing. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4662.02s)]
*  So I searched for a bunch of keywords, those keywords, and perhaps there's some natural [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4670.02s)]
*  language context or matched to a result page. And I click on that and it's linked out. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4673.46s)]
*  Years ago, Google started a product called the one box where they could take structured data, [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4678.42s)]
*  like what is the weather in San Francisco today, and that the top of the search result page just [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4682.42s)]
*  presented that data because it knows with high certainty, the question you're asking and it knows [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4687.7s)]
*  with high certainty, the answer it can give you. Yeah, click from somebody's website, right? So if [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4691.54s)]
*  that starts to become everything, then that one box interface, and it's not just Google's ability [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4695.86s)]
*  to access all this data and index it and serve it and store it, there could be a lot of competitors [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4702.18s)]
*  to the one box and a lot of competitors ultimately to search. And ultimately, Google's core product, [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4708.58s)]
*  their search engine could be radically disrupted by an alternative set system or set of systems [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4714.82s)]
*  that have more of a natural language chat interface. Which is literally why Google [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4722.58s)]
*  bought DeepMind and there were a collection of human powered search engines, Mahalo included, [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4729.54s)]
*  ChaCha, Answers.com, who are trying to do the human based version of this. It's just in scale. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4733.7s)]
*  We don't want to get ahead of ourselves because one of the things we don't know is how much is [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4738.42s)]
*  going on in DeepMind. They're not very open like OpenAI is. They talk about some of the advanced [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4742.02s)]
*  frontier stuff like Alpha Fold and so on and they've been public about that. But a lot of that is [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4746.900000000001s)]
*  really to generate interest and hype in what's next. But my understanding is DeepMind has been [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4751.22s)]
*  applied to everything from ads, ad optimization, but also the ranking on YouTube videos to get [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4756.1s)]
*  people more engagement on YouTube, et cetera, et cetera. So there's all these ways that DeepMind [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4763.14s)]
*  has been applied within Google services and certainly within search. But the question is, [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4766.66s)]
*  is there an entirely new interface for search that risks Google's core search business? [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4772.5s)]
*  And I think that there certainly will be a lot of money thrown at this. And if anyone has any [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4778.9s)]
*  interesting ideas, send me an email. Saks and then Chamath. Yeah, I think that's a really [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4782.42s)]
*  interesting point. I saw a thread on this where somebody was asking GPT a bunch of questions like [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4787.22s)]
*  generally like coding questions and they were actually comparing the result in Google versus [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4797.06s)]
*  GPT. And Google would just give you a reference to like a link to some page, whereas GPT-3 would [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4802.1s)]
*  actually construct the answer like a multi-paragraph answer that was far more detailed and in a way [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4807.94s)]
*  user-friendly. Whereas like the Google page would kick you over to a reference where it was like [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4814.82s)]
*  this one, two, three sort of maybe someone had created a checklist, but it just wasn't that [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4819.78s)]
*  detailed. It really is pretty interesting. I thought Andreessen tweeted a really interesting [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4824.1s)]
*  example as well where he asked GPT to create a scene from a play starring a New York Times [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4831.620000000001s)]
*  journalist and a Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur. They were arguing about free speech and each [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4839.620000000001s)]
*  passing asserts the view associated with his profession and social circle. We don't need to [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4843.54s)]
*  read the whole thing, but I thought this was like spot on where I was actually like both sides are [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4848.5s)]
*  making their best arguments and it's like to each other in a conversation that seems intelligible. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4853.86s)]
*  Like they're making their points at the right time in the conversation. It's like they're [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4859.46s)]
*  playing off each other. In other words, it actually reads like a conversation. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4864.82s)]
*  I actually thought this one was more impressive than the one with the best impersonation because [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4868.42s)]
*  I actually thought that the one about all in didn't really capture our personalities per se, [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4873.299999999999s)]
*  but this one actually does a pretty good job capturing the arguments in this debate. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4878.74s)]
*  So pretty impressive. Any thoughts here? [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4883.62s)]
*  Yeah, lots. I mean, I've been spending a lot of time learning about this area. Six years ago, [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4886.34s)]
*  a team that I partnered with who was at Google that built TPU, we've been building Silicon for [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4892.42s)]
*  this space. So we've been kind of going from the ground up for the last six years. A couple things [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4898.42s)]
*  that I'll say. The first is that I think we're going to replace SAS with what I call MAS, [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4902.34s)]
*  which is Models as a Service. And so, you know, a lot of what software will be, [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4910.26s)]
*  particularly in the enterprise, will get replaced with a single use model that allows you to solve [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4914.82s)]
*  a function. So these chat examples are one and you can name a bunch of SAS companies that were [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4920.02s)]
*  purveyors of SAS that will get replaced by essentially GPT-3 or some other language model. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4926.26s)]
*  And then there'll be a whole bunch of other things like that. If it's a, you know, [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4932.74s)]
*  expense management company, they'll have a model that'll allow them to actually do expense management [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4936.26s)]
*  or blah, blah, blah forecasting better. So I think SAS will get replaced over time with these [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4942.18s)]
*  models incrementally. That's phase one. But the problem with all of these models, in my opinion, [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4948.26s)]
*  is that they're still largely brittle. They are good at one thing. They are a single mode [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4953.62s)]
*  way of interfacing with data. The next big leap, and I think it will come from one of the big tech [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4961.22s)]
*  companies or from OpenAI, is and we talked about this, I talked about this a few episodes ago, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4968.1s)]
*  a multimodal model, which then allows you to actually bring together and join video voice data [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4973.06s)]
*  in a unique way to answer real substantive problems. So if I had to steel man the opposite [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4980.42s)]
*  side reaction, so I think there's a lot of people gushing over the novelty of GPT-3, [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4987.54s)]
*  if I had to, or chat GPT, if I had to steel man the opposite, what I would say is it's going to get [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4992.5s)]
*  somewhere between 95 to 99% of all of these very simple questions right, because they're kind of [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=4998.58s)]
*  cute and simple. There is no consequence of saying write a play because there is no wrong answer. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5005.22s)]
*  Right? You either kind of, it tickles your fancy or it doesn't, it kind of entertains you or it [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5010.58s)]
*  doesn't. When this stuff becomes very valuable is that when you really need a precise answer [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5015.7s)]
*  and you can guarantee that to be overwhelmingly right, that's the last 1 to 2% that is [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5022.66s)]
*  exceptionally hard. And I don't think that we're at a place yet where these models can do that, [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5027.7s)]
*  but when we get there, all of these models as a service will be very much commoditized. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5033.54s)]
*  And I think the real value is finding non-obvious sources of data that feed it. So, it's all about [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5040.82s)]
*  training. So, meaning you can break down machine learning and AI into two simple things. There's [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5049.38s)]
*  training, which is what you do asynchronously, and then there's inference, which is what you're [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5053.46s)]
*  doing in real time. So, when you're typing something into chat API or chat GPT, that's an inference [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5058.259999999999s)]
*  that's running and then you're generating an output. But the real key is where do you find [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5064.42s)]
*  proprietary sources of data that you can learn on top of? That's the real arms race. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5068.58s)]
*  So, one example would be, let's say you build a model to detect tumors, right? There's a lot of [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5076.0199999999995s)]
*  people doing that. Well, the company that will win may be the company that actually then vertically [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5082.42s)]
*  integrates, buys a hospital system and get access to patient data that is completely proprietary to [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5087.94s)]
*  them and covers the most number of women of all age groups and of all ethnic categories. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5095.06s)]
*  Those are the kinds of moves in business that we will see in the next five to ten years that I find [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5101.46s)]
*  much more exciting and trying to figure out how to play in that space. But I do think that chat GPT [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5106.580000000001s)]
*  is a wonderful example to point us in that direction. But I'm sort of more of that case, [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5112.42s)]
*  which is it's a cute toy, but we haven't yet cracked the one to two percent of use cases [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5118.580000000001s)]
*  that makes it super useful. But I think the first step, but just sorry, but the first step will be [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5123.62s)]
*  the transformation of SAS to mass. And then from there, we think we can try to figure this out. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5128.5s)]
*  It reminds me of in a way when you when you give that description of like, hey, this is really [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5133.62s)]
*  interesting, but it's not complete. Is remember when GPS came out and like people are like doing [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5136.98s)]
*  turn by turn navigation, they drive off the road because they were trusting it too much. And then, [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5142.18s)]
*  you know, over 20 years of GPS, we're kind of like, yeah, it's pretty bulletproof, but keep your eyes [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5146.66s)]
*  on the road, same thing that's happening. And these changes tend to be slow. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5150.9s)]
*  Right. These last 100 or 200 basis points literally takes decades. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5154.82s)]
*  Exactly. So the last 15% of self driving is like the decade long, you know, slot. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5158.82s)]
*  That may take a century. 15% may take a century, but the last 2% will take a few. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5163.139999999999s)]
*  It's like the change happens very slowly and then all at once for people who don't know what a TPU [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5166.98s)]
*  is. That's a tensor processing unit. This is Google's application specific circuits, right? [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5171.62s)]
*  And custom silicon that they invented for TensorFlow at the time. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5177.379999999999s)]
*  Although now the modality of AI, we've changed that as well. So now we're totally in the world [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5181.46s)]
*  of transformers. So we're not even using, you know, you're not letting the tensors flow the [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5184.74s)]
*  way they used to. All right. There's been a slow down in SaaS. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5189.86s)]
*  Sax, what is happening in the software as a service world? [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5192.58s)]
*  There was a good update by Jammin Ball who works for Altimeter, our friend, Brad Gersener. He does [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5196.66s)]
*  these really great updates on what's happening in the SaaS world. The big thing this week is that [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5201.46s)]
*  Salesforce had its quarter and I would consider Salesforce to be the bellwether for the whole SaaS [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5206.1s)]
*  category. I think they're the largest pure SaaS company. They were the first multi-tenant SaaS [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5211.22s)]
*  like company at scale. And what they've shown is a huge slowdown. Basically, their net new ARR [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5216.9800000000005s)]
*  that they just added in the previous quarter dropped two-thirds compared to the previous quarter. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5224.9800000000005s)]
*  But because their sales and marketing spend was the same as the previous quarter, [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5231.06s)]
*  it exploded their CAC payback, which means the amount of time it takes to pay back your customer [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5235.46s)]
*  acquisition costs for a given customer. So you see there are 155 months it would take now to pay back [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5241.219999999999s)]
*  the customer acquisition costs. That's over 10 years. That doesn't work. I mean, I think [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5249.379999999999s)]
*  before this quarter, it was more like two and a half years. That's something that you can afford. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5254.339999999999s)]
*  A company can't, if you're spending 10 years of gross profit on a customer to acquire them, [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5259.86s)]
*  the business doesn't make sense. So now I'm not saying any of this to pick on Salesforce. It's [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5265.94s)]
*  an exceptionally run company, one of the absolute best. Mark Banyoff, fantastic CEO, founder, [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5270.58s)]
*  great human being. But I think the point here is that what you're seeing is the whole SaaS industry [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5278.66s)]
*  is really slowing down here. In the first half of the year, you saw SaaS valuations correct. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5285.14s)]
*  Now we're actually seeing SaaS top line correct. And there's an interesting question here. If your [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5291.3s)]
*  CAC payback goes from two and a half years to 10 years, you have to bring your CAC down. How do [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5297.780000000001s)]
*  you do that? You can either reduce marketing or you can reduce sales. So in other words, you can [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5302.5s)]
*  reduce- You mean cut the sales team. You can either cut people and head count from your own team, [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5308.1s)]
*  or you can cut spending you do on advertising or events or money that you spend on other companies. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5312.98s)]
*  Either way, there's going to be a big contraction in jobs basically around this industry. And I [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5320.0199999999995s)]
*  think that what that could do is cause a vicious cycle where- Death spiral? [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5326.66s)]
*  We start seeing, I wouldn't say death spiral. I think this vicious cycle for the next year or so, [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5331.7s)]
*  where seat contraction becomes the norm instead of seat expansion. So if you go back over the last [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5336.099999999999s)]
*  10 years, a major tailwind at the backs of SaaS startups has been that every year, you start with [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5342.58s)]
*  120%, 130%, 150% of last year's revenue just from your existing customers. Why? Because they were [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5349.38s)]
*  hiring more and more people and they needed to buy more and more seats. But now headcount growth is [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5356.1s)]
*  frozen and in fact, companies are doing major layoffs. So the baseline for next year could be [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5360.98s)]
*  seat contraction. So instead of starting with 120% of last year's revenue, you might start with 80% or [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5366.5s)]
*  90% because there's going to be so much churn. So I think that SaaS companies need to take this [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5371.54s)]
*  into account. This idea that growth is on autopilot, that could start to go in reverse. I don't think [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5376.98s)]
*  permanently, but I think for the next year or so. This is why I also tweeted 2X is the new 3X. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5382.74s)]
*  If you can grow 2X year over year in this environment, that is as good as or better than [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5388.1s)]
*  growing 3X last year. Oh, it's better. Clearly it's better. Like a lot of companies that weren't [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5393.38s)]
*  that great could grow 3X last year because it was so times are so frothy. Everyone was buying [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5398.26s)]
*  everything. But now it is going to be really hard to even double year over year. Companies need to [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5403.06s)]
*  take that into account into their financial planning. You need to restrain your burn because [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5407.9400000000005s)]
*  a lot of the revenue that you predict is going to be there may not be there. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5412.820000000001s)]
*  All right. Thanks so much to the Secretary of SaaS. I think you got a board meeting. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5417.14s)]
*  I do. I got to run. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5422.26s)]
*  One of the interesting things I saw in terms of use cases is somebody used the chat GPT to [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5423.06s)]
*  describe rooms, then they took the descriptions of those rooms and then they put them into like [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5428.660000000001s)]
*  Dolly or stable diffusion, one of those, and it created the visual. I'm curious if you think, [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5432.900000000001s)]
*  you know, the self driving API's and machine learning that's going on. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5437.9400000000005s)]
*  They got images, then you got chat, maybe you have proteins going on with the alpha fold stuff. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5442.9800000000005s)]
*  When these things start talking to each other, is that going to be the emergent [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5448.66s)]
*  behavior that we see of general AI? And that's how we'll interpret it in our world is these [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5453.94s)]
*  hundred different vertical AI's hitting some level of reasonableness to Chimott's point on data sets. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5459.0599999999995s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, the self driving AI is talking to the one that's looking at cancer and [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5467.0599999999995s)]
*  tumor diagnosis in the chat and the image ones, it may be stable diffusion, the protein AI, [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5471.7s)]
*  and the one that's looking at cancer cells start talking to each other. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5477.86s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not sure that's as likely as the there's a lot of solutions that will emerge [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5480.82s)]
*  within verticals. And I think you can distinguish them. So I kind of gave this example a few months [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5489.94s)]
*  ago. If you remember, Kai's power tools was a plugin for Adobe Photoshop in 1993, I believe, [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5495.299999999999s)]
*  and Kai's power tools completely transformed the potential of Adobe Photoshop, because Photoshop [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5503.94s)]
*  had all the basic brushing and editing capabilities within it. Kai's power tools was statistical [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5509.38s)]
*  models that basically took the matrix of the pixels and created some evolution of them into [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5514.42s)]
*  some visual output like a blur. And so you could blur motion blur or something and you could change [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5522.34s)]
*  the parameters. And now your photo looked like it was going through a motion blur. Ultimately, [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5526.82s)]
*  Photoshop bought and implemented those tools. But those were similar, there were statistical models [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5531.7s)]
*  that made some representation of the input, which was the image, and then created an output, [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5536.9s)]
*  which was an adjusted image. I would argue that that is very similar, although the models behind [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5540.98s)]
*  it are very different in terms of the contextual application of statistical models in software. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5546.82s)]
*  And you could see stuff like, for example, a chatbot that replaces help me figure out whether my [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5554.34s)]
*  credit card charges are correct or not, instead of having a customer service agent, an offshore [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5561.22s)]
*  customer service agent helping you resolve that, or help me return my item. Or there are very [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5566.34s)]
*  specific kind of verticalized applications that can plug in that ultimately replace what was manual [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5572.34s)]
*  and human driven before, because humans used to manually make the motion blur in Photoshop, [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5579.62s)]
*  and then it was automated with these software packages. And I think you can kind of think [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5584.1s)]
*  about it in that same way that these are known knowns, they don't require necessarily [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5587.46s)]
*  human physical labor or some human responsiveness, that if 95% of the work can be handled, [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5593.06s)]
*  it will get handled by some verticalized solution. So I think the physical labor versus the non-physical [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5599.06s)]
*  labor is one way to think about the distinction, meaning is there some change in the physical [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5604.9800000000005s)]
*  world? Driving is absolutely a change in the physical world. You have to move physically [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5608.74s)]
*  through space. So that one is a very distinct class. All the stuff that's like communication, [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5613.14s)]
*  imagery, static imagery, audio, and then visual video, there's some stacking that happens there. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5619.46s)]
*  And some of those will be kind of siloed, and then some of them will merge, and you'll have these [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5626.42s)]
*  kind of unique kind of combo models. And so look, as they start to work together, I think we'll see [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5630.42s)]
*  them, you know, completely rewrite some of these verticals, like movie production or music production, [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5635.38s)]
*  right, or advertising, or we're seeing it now with, with video and creative arts, with, [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5642.42s)]
*  you know, some of the visual stuff on it. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5649.46s)]
*  And to be honest, a lot of journalism, a lot of creative arts have become the wisdom of the [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5651.3s)]
*  crowds over the last two decades, where, you know, artists were looking at the collective works [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5655.22s)]
*  of the internet, interpreting it, and then coming up with content, which is kind of what these AI's [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5660.9800000000005s)]
*  are doing. And then who legally owns the collective content is going to be a big question. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5666.26s)]
*  Chamath, you talked about data sets, and Microsoft is being sued right now, and GitHub, because they [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5672.42s)]
*  used open source to create tools in AI to help augment programmers, like while they're programming, [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5678.42s)]
*  writing code, it gives them suggestions. And now the open source community is suing them [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5684.820000000001s)]
*  for using their data set. So what do you think about the legality of data sets, Chamath? And should [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5688.66s)]
*  they get some kind of protection if you make a GPT-3 based on Quora or based on Wikipedia, [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5693.22s)]
*  should you have to get approval to use that data? [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5699.54s)]
*  Chamath It's the exact opposite. It's the exact opposite. They say that this is actually your work. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5702.34s)]
*  And I think that that's the right legal framework. But the answer to your other question is, [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5709.54s)]
*  this is why I think the hunt for proprietary data actually becomes the hunt that matters. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5713.7s)]
*  All of this other stuff, I think, is a lot less important, because I think you have to assume that [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5719.62s)]
*  all of these models will eventually just get commoditized. So there'll be a, you know, like [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5723.7s)]
*  you see like Jasper AI, and you see a bunch of these generative AI companies, it's really interesting. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5728.66s)]
*  But the problem is, when you sit it on top of the same substrate, you'll have a convergence, [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5733.78s)]
*  right? Everybody's chat model will eventually look and sound and feel like the same thing, [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5738.26s)]
*  unless you're giving it a few special ingredients that other people are not. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5742.58s)]
*  And so it's the hunt for those ingredients that will make this next generation of models really [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5748.26s)]
*  valuable. So to give an example, you'd have Wikipedia, which is Creative Commons anybody [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5754.34s)]
*  can use. But Quora as a data set, not everybody can use that's owned by a company. So Quora would [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5758.82s)]
*  have an advantage. Take an extreme example. If Quora didn't allow themselves to be crawled, [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5763.62s)]
*  right, okay, which they don't. Yeah. But then they and then they develop their own language model, [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5770.5s)]
*  which used the best of the internet. So call it, you know, GPT. And Quora, maybe they are slightly [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5776.18s)]
*  better in certain domains and others. The other extreme example is the one that I used in healthcare, [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5785.06s)]
*  which is, you know, if you have access to patient data that you will not license to anybody else, [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5789.86s)]
*  you know, it stands to reason that that model actually then has much better chances of [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5796.1s)]
*  highly effective clinical outcomes versus any other model. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5802.82s)]
*  Apple Watch comes to mind, right? Apple has all that watch data, they could pair that with [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5805.86s)]
*  epics. It's another very good example. That's another good example. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5810.74s)]
*  What could they do together? So this is going to be like this is the new oil is going to be data. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5813.86s)]
*  And by the way, like to talk about Apple for a second, the smart thing is they've gotten so [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5818.18s)]
*  methodically, they've never touted the AI, you know, they introduce one or two distinguishing [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5823.14s)]
*  features every year, right? So like the the the ECG, which was introduced many, many years ago, [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5828.9800000000005s)]
*  is has only gotten slightly more usable like five or six years later. But in the meantime, [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5835.700000000001s)]
*  there's, you know, 10s of millions of watches collecting this kind of data. So to your point, [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5840.5s)]
*  it's it's using these devices as Trojan horses to collect training data that is the oil, [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5846.1s)]
*  Uber and Tesla have all this data of the data being collected by, you know, the [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5851.9400000000005s)]
*  phone or the cameras in the cars. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5858.9800000000005s)]
*  The other difference though, is that you have to be in a realm where you don't need regulators [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5861.38s)]
*  to go the last mile. So the problem with a DAS, I think, or level five autonomy, [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5866.9800000000005s)]
*  is that eventually you get to a point where even if the model becomes quote unquote, perfect, [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5872.1s)]
*  you still need regulatory approval. And what I'm saying is, I think you have to focus on areas of [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5877.219999999999s)]
*  the economy that are not subject to that, or where the regulatory pathways already defined. So for [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5881.78s)]
*  example, if you use a healthcare example, let's say that you had the largest corpus of breast [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5887.62s)]
*  cancer image data, and you could actually build an AI that was a much better classifier for tumors [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5891.46s)]
*  versus other things. The FDA actually has a pathway to get that approved very quickly. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5895.94s)]
*  The problem with, you know, level five autonomy is that there is no clear pathway. It's not, again, [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5902.82s)]
*  we go back to almost a crypto example. We don't really know who will govern that decision. And we [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5906.9s)]
*  don't know how that will be governed. So I think the thing that investors have to do, and [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5912.74s)]
*  entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs have to pick their end market very carefully. And investors have to [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5918.26s)]
*  realize that this dynamic exists as well, if you're going to do this right. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5922.34s)]
*  Imagine the Robinhood trading, you know, trader data set, watching people sell and shares in [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5925.14s)]
*  and predicting markets with it with AI. I mean, it could be crazy. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5932.26s)]
*  Well, you have that payment for order flow that's used by Citadel and the other big... [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5934.74s)]
*  But not AI, right? So then who knows? Maybe they are using AI on their side. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5938.42s)]
*  No, no, no, not that they are. I can tell you as somebody who sells, [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5941.54s)]
*  we sell a lot of machine learning hardware into this market. The biggest buyers are the [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5945.7s)]
*  US government and these ultra high frequency trading organizations. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5951.06s)]
*  Friedberg, any final thoughts here? I'll give you the final word. How could this affect [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5954.82s)]
*  astronomy? How did this affect our search of the galaxies, you know, going out past Pluto, Saturn, [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5959.54s)]
*  breaching Uranus, any of those things? How could it impact? [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5966.5s)]
*  I'm trying to get a Uranus joke to land. Help me out here, Tramont. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5973.94s)]
*  I think you need to have more space related... [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5978.66s)]
*  Yeah, could you workshop this one with me? [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5983.299999999999s)]
*  Or gut biome related, you know? [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5984.82s)]
*  So how would this affect super gut? You have to trick Friedberg into thinking we're asking a [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5988.18s)]
*  serious question. Get him down the science path and then rug pull him. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5993.62s)]
*  That's a good proper rug pull. Exactly. Okay, let's do it. Here we go. Let's workshop. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=5997.06s)]
*  So tell us, you know, when you're doing like super gut, use promo code twist to get 25% off. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6001.3s)]
*  When you're doing super gut, you're analyzing people's guts. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6006.02s)]
*  How would you then have machine learning in this, you know, API, this chat API and GPT-3? [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6009.46s)]
*  How could that help with processing all of that, especially when it passes through Uranus? [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6016.18s)]
*  Friedberg. You okay up there, Friedberg? [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6023.46s)]
*  You are hungover. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6026.820000000001s)]
*  I'm hungover, but I also had like a 7am board meeting. So I'm also just a little beat up. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6028.26s)]
*  Were you grumpy on the board meeting? Did you get a little contangent? [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6033.700000000001s)]
*  No, no, it's fine. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6036.26s)]
*  You were fine? You kept the rage in control? [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6036.9800000000005s)]
*  I think I had my caffeine fuel and then I kind of cranked down afterwards. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6039.38s)]
*  All right, everybody. We will see you next time for the secretary of SAS, the dictator [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6044.66s)]
*  and the Sultan of hungover. We will see you next time. Bye bye. Love you guys. Bye bye. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6051.54s)]
*  What? [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6074.66s)]
*  Besties are gone. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6080.34s)]
*  That is my dog taking a notice in your driveway. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6082.9s)]
*  We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just like this, [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6090.74s)]
*  like sexual tension, but they just need to release them out. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6095.139999999999s)]
*  What? [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6098.74s)]
*  You're the B. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6099.139999999999s)]
*  What? [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6100.18s)]
*  You're B. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6100.98s)]
*  What? [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6102.18s)]
*  We need to get merch. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU&t=6103.14s)]
