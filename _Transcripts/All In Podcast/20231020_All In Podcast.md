# E150 IsraelGaza escalating or not? EU censorship regime, Penn donors revolt, GLP-1 hype cycle
**All In Podcast:** [October 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE)
*  Well, you're talking about three very different actors there. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=0.0s)]
*  Wait, David, David, behind you is your security cameras are on. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2.56s)]
*  Do you want to turn those off? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5.4s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know how that works. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=6.4s)]
*  All right, hold on a second. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=7.4s)]
*  You sit there and watch those all day? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=8.4s)]
*  Security apparatus. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=13.36s)]
*  What is this guy, the Batman? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=14.36s)]
*  He sits in that couch all day and watches his security cameras. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=17.36s)]
*  Hey, did you see that behind him? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=21.32s)]
*  It was so dystopian. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=23.76s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=25.52s)]
*  You must have caught some crazy shit on those security cameras. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=26.64s)]
*  What do you do with that footage? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=29.24s)]
*  OK, everybody, welcome to episode 150 of the All In Podcast. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  Yes, we've made it to 150 episodes somehow. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  Talking about technology, business and, of course, politics. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=58.04s)]
*  And this week, we will continue our discussion. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=62.48s)]
*  Tragically about the situation in Israel and the war with Hamas [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=66.88s)]
*  and a lot of the downstream. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=71.36s)]
*  Effects of what's going on here and try to make sense of the world as we do. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=74.4s)]
*  We gave a disclaimer last week. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=78.72s)]
*  We're not experts. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=80.08s)]
*  And I suspect many of you are not experts on this, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=81.24s)]
*  but we're going to try to talk about the hard topic here and do it in good faith. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=84.60000000000001s)]
*  And then we will move on to topics that don't have to do with the war [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=91.12s)]
*  in Gaza that could by the time you read this again, another disclaimer, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=95.4s)]
*  by the time you listen to this podcast, a ground invasion may or may not have started. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=100.0s)]
*  We take these on Thursdays and you listen to them, generally speaking, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=105.88s)]
*  on Saturdays and Sundays with me again this week. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=109.36s)]
*  Jamath, Paul, you have to hear David Saks and, of course, David Friedberg. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=113.47999999999999s)]
*  And gentlemen, I'm just going around the horn here quick before I tee up the first topic. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=118.19999999999999s)]
*  How's everybody feeling about the events [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=124.28s)]
*  in the 10 days since 10, seven in the terrorist attack that occurred in Israel? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=126.8s)]
*  I skipped last week. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=132.92s)]
*  I was too emotional to do the show, just so folks know. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=135.32s)]
*  It was. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=139.04s)]
*  Difficult. To see what I saw on the Internet and the reporting. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=142.32s)]
*  I think I was really moved. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=149.92s)]
*  Because I thought a lot about the like. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=155.68s)]
*  How lucky we are in the I thought about my children and seeing what I saw [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=159.28s)]
*  and being a parent. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  It's really different. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=168.28s)]
*  I remember 9 11. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=170.72s)]
*  It was really shocking. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=171.84s)]
*  I was really upset from 9 11 as well. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=173.32s)]
*  But when I saw the events last week. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=175.28s)]
*  It immediately projected onto my kids and the. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=179.76s)]
*  Care I try and take for my kids and thinking about. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=183.44s)]
*  The experience of other people in this situation, I was also, I'll be honest, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=187.44s)]
*  really moved and saddened. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=193.16s)]
*  Because of. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=196.16s)]
*  The bombing of children in Gaza, and I was really saddened that there are [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  innocent children suffering there as well. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=202.88s)]
*  And the whole thing just felt so horrific to me. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=207.44s)]
*  I don't think about the justification or the morality of one side over another. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=210.8s)]
*  I was just more moved because I felt really sad about the experience of a lot [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=216.28s)]
*  of families and a lot of children caught in the middle caught in this in this [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=220.64s)]
*  environment. So I was I was pretty hurt last week. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=225.72s)]
*  I was in a really bad state and I couldn't do the show. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=228.11999999999998s)]
*  I think. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=231.16s)]
*  You know, time has allowed me to kind of become a bit rational about things and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=233.48s)]
*  trying to understand where things are headed. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=237.39999999999998s)]
*  And it's a really complicated, confusing situation. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=238.88s)]
*  It's really sad. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=241.92s)]
*  I worry a lot about where things are headed, not just in the Middle East, but [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  also domestically coming out of this conflict. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=247.56s)]
*  So that's where I'm at. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=251.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=253.11999999999998s)]
*  Thank you for sharing. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=254.39999999999998s)]
*  I wasn't sure if you would share your absence last week. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=255.48s)]
*  And I think it's fair. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=258.36s)]
*  I, too, have been thinking about my own children and it's at 9 11 and it's it's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=259.56s)]
*  very dark. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=265.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=266.4s)]
*  And so it's hard to talk about. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  But we're making progress here, I think. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=270.4s)]
*  And today we'll talk about a lot of the issues, Chamath or Sax, any opening [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=272.8s)]
*  thoughts before we get started delving into what's actually happening. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=279.36s)]
*  And then more importantly, I think. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=284.36s)]
*  Where this is heading and what the possible outcome or resolution could be [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=286.88s)]
*  if there is a resolution here. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=292.4s)]
*  I think things are getting better, actually. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=295.2s)]
*  I think from where, if you had to graph your expectations of how bad things [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=297.28s)]
*  could get, I think what most people would probably say is somewhere last week. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=303.24s)]
*  There was a scepter of some potential World War Three like contagion. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=309.56s)]
*  And I think in general, it hasn't stopped some of the bloodshed, but the extent to [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=315.64s)]
*  which we expected this thing to escalate, it actually hasn't happened. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=322.96s)]
*  And so if you take a step back and you kind of calmly and coldly look at the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=328.52s)]
*  facts, I think that there are a lot of people on all sides trying to maintain [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  their composure in a moment where there's a lot of brushfires. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=341.08000000000004s)]
*  So I actually think that this has been much, much better than it could have been. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  And so I'm generally optimistic that we're going to find our way out of this. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=356.72s)]
*  So, Sax, any thoughts? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=360.96000000000004s)]
*  As well, to be honest, I can't be as optimistic as Jamath. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=364.36s)]
*  It's true that World War Three hasn't started yet, but I think the situation [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=367.04s)]
*  is incredibly volatile still. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=370.76s)]
*  Just the last couple of days, the headline story was an explosion or [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=373.24s)]
*  bombing of this hospital in Gaza. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=378.68s)]
*  Blame immediately fell on Israel. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=382.32s)]
*  The claim in the New York Times was that they had dropped a bomb on it from a [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=384.8s)]
*  plane. Social media was aflame with that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=388.4s)]
*  I think in the last day or so, the perspective seems to be changing. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=392.91999999999996s)]
*  There's video now showing that it wasn't the hospital, but rather the parking lot [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  next to the hospital that took the brunt of the damage. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=402.56s)]
*  I think that it's far from clear that Israel did it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=406.32s)]
*  A lot of people are blaming Islamic jihad. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=410.59999999999997s)]
*  In any event, it's very unclear. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=414.08s)]
*  So I'm going to continue to do what I've done, which is suspend judgment until [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=415.8s)]
*  there can be some sort of proper investigation of what happened and we find [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=419.2s)]
*  out exactly who's really responsible. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=423.32s)]
*  But it does seem that over the last day or so, there's been now a backing off of [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=425.36s)]
*  the idea that Israel was definitely responsible for this. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=431.24s)]
*  Nonetheless, you saw immediately in the wake of that story coming out that there [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=433.56s)]
*  were protests and riots all over the Middle East. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=440.68s)]
*  The Arab street was absolutely ignited. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=445.71999999999997s)]
*  And I think that the Arab streets not going to be convinced that Israel wasn't [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=449.47999999999996s)]
*  responsible for this. I just think that they're convinced. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=454.47999999999996s)]
*  And I think partisans on both sides are convinced about who did it and they're [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=456.64s)]
*  going to be immune to whatever evidence comes out. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=462.12s)]
*  So I think that's kind of the situation we're at right now. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=464.8s)]
*  I would consider the riots that we just saw in regards to the hospital and the [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=467.92s)]
*  eruption on social media to be a prelude or dress rehearsal of what we can expect [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=474.0s)]
*  to happen almost every day if Israel proceeds with a ground invasion of Gaza. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=479.92s)]
*  Now they haven't done that yet. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=486.08s)]
*  And that's why the situation seems tenuous, but stable. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=487.6s)]
*  But we're still waiting to find out if Israel's going to go into Gaza. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=491.68s)]
*  And if they do, I think all bets are off in terms of where this is going. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=495.6s)]
*  This was my biggest concern last week. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=499.56s)]
*  I think the thing I was most anxious about was that the imagery that would come [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=501.8s)]
*  out of Gaza with the action from Israel would be the fodder for escalation [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=509.6s)]
*  worldwide, that there's this perception already with half a billion people, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=518.64s)]
*  maybe two billion people, maybe more, that there's an oppressor and there's [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=526.72s)]
*  an oppressed and the oppressed is suffering under the oppressor and that [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=531.48s)]
*  there would be the creation of fodder to support that narrative. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=536.56s)]
*  And I think that the hospital bombing, the kind of point I made to someone who [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=539.88s)]
*  reached out to me two days ago or yesterday about it was, I don't know if it [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=543.7199999999999s)]
*  matters that we get the corrections from all these people that may have said [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=549.16s)]
*  something that turns out to not be true. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=553.0s)]
*  Because it was almost like that media became confirmation bias for people that [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=555.3599999999999s)]
*  already felt that this is what was going on and this is simply evidence of what [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=559.52s)]
*  is going on and it justifies the next step. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=564.8s)]
*  It justifies the beliefs. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=568.5999999999999s)]
*  It justifies the morality. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=570.12s)]
*  And I don't think that if it wasn't this, it's going to be something else. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=573.4399999999999s)]
*  There is a Tinder box ready to be lit and that Tinder box is just looking for a [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=578.8s)]
*  match and whether it's this match or the next match, there's going to be a match [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=584.04s)]
*  and the Tinder box will be lit. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=587.92s)]
*  I think that a large number of people feel like they're on the right side. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=590.16s)]
*  Everyone thinks they're on the right side of something. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=594.4s)]
*  Everyone feels like they have the right moral stance, that there is a regime on [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=596.76s)]
*  the other side that has the wrong moral stance. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=600.64s)]
*  I am good, you are evil. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=603.1999999999999s)]
*  And therefore anything I see is my confirmation bias for my belief. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=605.28s)]
*  And it'll, it gives me permission to take the next step. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=611.3199999999999s)]
*  And in that framework, it will only escalate and we are only going to a dark place. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=615.28s)]
*  And I think the real question for me to Chumot's optimism is what are the [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=621.76s)]
*  muting factors, what are the factors where one side feels like they're [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=626.2s)]
*  getting something that forces them to say, I'm not going to take the next step. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=630.32s)]
*  I'm not going to justify the next step. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=635.6400000000001s)]
*  And it's a, it's a really hard question to answer at this stage. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=637.5600000000001s)]
*  Let's, let's take that other side and just explore it for a second. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=640.9200000000001s)]
*  So the question that I've been asking myself is, cause I agree with you. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=644.24s)]
*  It doesn't matter who was responsible for this bombing because it's already [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=649.96s)]
*  been defined for, yeah, but in a moral sense, it does just do it. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=654.2800000000001s)]
*  No, no, in a moral sense, it does. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=657.2800000000001s)]
*  But I'm saying practically in the theater of war and the theaters near the war, it [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=658.92s)]
*  doesn't matter because it's about how is it framed and to your point, people have [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=663.12s)]
*  already made up their minds, the pro-Israel side have made up their mind and the [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=669.32s)]
*  pro-Palestinian side has made up their mind. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=675.4399999999999s)]
*  But the question that I ask myself is, okay, is that how much of an incremental [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=678.88s)]
*  escalation is it from what their status quo is? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=685.0s)]
*  You know, one of the interesting things I learned from the Jared Kushner interview [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=689.28s)]
*  with Lex Friedman, it's like a lot of this tension you can trace back to the [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=694.92s)]
*  Al-Aqsa mosque and all of the misinformation around that, right? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=702.6s)]
*  He spends a section of that podcast talking about how that's been framed and [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=706.72s)]
*  reframed the miss and disinformation to basically get people fervently up in arms. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=711.48s)]
*  And it turns out that it isn't under the supervision of the Israelis. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=717.28s)]
*  And in fact, you know, you can go get a visa to visit Al-Aqsa mosque and it's [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=721.64s)]
*  under the custodianship of the King of Jordan as an example. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=726.2s)]
*  So that is the fact, but those facts aren't necessarily shared on the ground. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=730.04s)]
*  And that is where a lot of this original tension comes from. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=735.64s)]
*  So then I ask myself, okay, well, if that's been lingering for decades, how [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=740.28s)]
*  much more incrementally bad does it get for this specific thing? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=745.52s)]
*  And I think you see it in people's actions, which is they try to use it to [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=750.12s)]
*  escalate and my honest measurement of that escalation is that outside of the [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=754.32s)]
*  actual theater of war, most of these escalations died down pretty quickly. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=760.24s)]
*  Now, if all of these embassies were overrun and all of a sudden you saw a [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=766.36s)]
*  Beirut like situation, right? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=771.5999999999999s)]
*  The U S embassy in Beirut in the early eighties. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=773.4799999999999s)]
*  I would agree with you that this is getting really bad really quickly, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=775.56s)]
*  but that's not what we saw. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=779.68s)]
*  And I think what that speaks to more is how much hatred is actually in the [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=781.0s)]
*  heart of people versus not. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=785.28s)]
*  And so I think that this was a moment for people to channel their anxiety and [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=787.92s)]
*  some of their aggression and some of their hatred towards America or Israel. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=794.8399999999999s)]
*  But what it didn't was escalate. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=799.32s)]
*  You didn't see these embassies get burnt to the ground. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=802.48s)]
*  You didn't see people getting dragged out. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=804.8000000000001s)]
*  And so I'm not trying to justify that behavior. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=806.48s)]
*  I'm just trying to look at it in an absolute sense and answer the question. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=808.64s)]
*  Is it escalating or is it not escalating? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=813.0400000000001s)]
*  And my assessment right now is that it is not escalating. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=816.64s)]
*  I saw on Sunday something that I thought I would never see, which is Iran put out [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=823.0s)]
*  a press release through the United Nations to Israel. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=827.84s)]
*  You haven't seen that. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=830.8000000000001s)]
*  That's de-escalatory. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=831.72s)]
*  That's not an escalatory action from a country whose mission statement includes [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=833.64s)]
*  the destruction and demise of a country. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=837.8000000000001s)]
*  So I think when push comes to shove, there are a lot of people in positions of [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=840.88s)]
*  power who understand the stakes here and are trying their best on both sides. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=846.12s)]
*  And I hate this word, so I can't even believe I'm about to use it to find some [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=853.72s)]
*  proportionality and try to de-escalate. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=857.2s)]
*  That's how I measure and judge what I see over the last week. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=859.48s)]
*  A lot of people use labels to characterize the actions, the tonality, the behavior [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=864.1600000000001s)]
*  of the other side, because everyone believes that they're on the right side. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=872.48s)]
*  And the point of view that there is hate and anger on the other side comes from a [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=878.36s)]
*  place not out of the blue. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=884.1600000000001s)]
*  Hate and anger doesn't just emerge from nothing. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=885.8s)]
*  It typically comes from a place of deep hurt. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=888.0799999999999s)]
*  I think the biggest question for me is how do you resolve the deep hurt that is [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=891.9599999999999s)]
*  being felt and has been felt by either side over a very long period of time? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=898.8s)]
*  It's the hardest thing to answer because what do you give millions of people that [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=903.4799999999999s)]
*  have lived feeling hurt for so long, feeling challenged for so long that makes [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=909.5999999999999s)]
*  them feel resolved in that sense? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=914.96s)]
*  And I get that you're speaking about the Palestinian people. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=916.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm speaking about the Israeli people too. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=920.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=922.64s)]
*  And I'm speaking about the fact that these actions don't come out of the blue. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=922.88s)]
*  They don't come out of a place of greed. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=929.48s)]
*  Let's go to an example in our own lives. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=933.12s)]
*  Let's just say that we have a friend or we had a girlfriend at some point where [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=935.0400000000001s)]
*  there is a deep betrayal. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=940.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=942.52s)]
*  And then there's just an unrelenting anger. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=943.2s)]
*  To your point, before you can talk about the hurt, you have to deescalate the anger. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=948.64s)]
*  So there has to be an active process of deescalation before you can [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=954.96s)]
*  actually resolve this stuff. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=958.44s)]
*  I thought Israel was quite clear last week. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=959.72s)]
*  We are going into Gaza on Sunday, but then they didn't. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=962.1600000000001s)]
*  That seemed deescalatory. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=967.52s)]
*  Again, I'll just say it again. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=969.2s)]
*  Iran puts out a press release to Israel through the UN. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=970.76s)]
*  That seemed deescalatory. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=975.1999999999999s)]
*  There was a moment where Jordan, the Palestinian authority and Biden were [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=977.8399999999999s)]
*  supposed to meet, they ended up not meeting in Amman, but that seemed deescalatory. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=983.8s)]
*  Biden, Tony Blinken, Tony refused to leave the IDF until he got some [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=990.52s)]
*  assurances about humanitarian aid into Gaza. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=994.64s)]
*  That seems deescalatory. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=997.16s)]
*  Biden spending time and then reiterating those assurances from Netanyahu. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=999.28s)]
*  Again, all of this stuff seems like both sides are in the middle of all of this [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1003.6s)]
*  chaos, not trying to light the tinderbox. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1008.84s)]
*  And it doesn't mean that they're on a path to resolution, but I just think [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1011.8s)]
*  that they understand the stakes. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1016.12s)]
*  Facts. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1017.88s)]
*  When we look at the hospital situation specifically and the fog of war, you had [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1019.08s)]
*  the New York Times getting attacked for maybe taking Hamas's word for it, then [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1025.12s)]
*  flipping, and then now there is conspiracy theory, the United States is, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1032.24s)]
*  you know, carrying water for Israel. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1037.76s)]
*  And then the fog of war, oh my goodness, maybe the hospital wasn't even hit. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1040.1599999999999s)]
*  It was in the parking lot. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1046.0s)]
*  And so it didn't even get hit. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1048.8s)]
*  So when we look at all of that and then Shema says, Hey, but wait, things [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1050.72s)]
*  haven't escalated. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1053.68s)]
*  I actually, I happened to be here in Dubai right now on a business trip and I'll [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1054.5600000000002s)]
*  explain some of the feedback I've gotten from people who are Palestinian, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1059.44s)]
*  ethnically or Jordanian and of Palestinian descent, I should say. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1067.0s)]
*  And we'll get into that in a second. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1071.44s)]
*  The ground war hasn't happened. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1073.04s)]
*  And this seems to be one of the, as Chamath is pointing out, it's fascinating [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1074.8400000000001s)]
*  that it hasn't because it was supposed to have happened already. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1080.2s)]
*  Do you have any thoughts on why it hasn't happened? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1082.72s)]
*  One of the conspiracy theories, and I hate to go down these roads because in [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1085.48s)]
*  the fog of war, I think people try to fill a vacuum and then of course, as you [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1090.1200000000001s)]
*  were pointing out Chamath and Freberg, people then use it as evidence for [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1093.6000000000001s)]
*  their side, the people here in Dubai, a number of people have pointed out this [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1096.68s)]
*  ground war is not going to happen. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1101.56s)]
*  That it's saber rattling, but Israel is going to back down and get the hostages [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1103.8s)]
*  back and this has been told to me by many people. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1109.76s)]
*  And I don't know if that's wishful thinking or some kind of conspiracy theory, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1112.48s)]
*  but what do you take from the ground war not happening? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1116.16s)]
*  And then if you want to go back and touch on the fog of war issue here with [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1119.16s)]
*  things flipping back and forth and what is actual reality and just broadly [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1123.72s)]
*  speaking, escalating or de-escalating. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1128.16s)]
*  Look, I think that there's a few possible reasons why Israel hasn't gone in yet. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1130.48s)]
*  Number one is they may perceive it to be a very difficult military operation. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1134.68s)]
*  They're almost certainly walking into a trap. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1138.88s)]
*  There's going to be ambushes everywhere, snipers, IEDs. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1141.04s)]
*  Hamas has an elaborate tunnel network. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1145.76s)]
*  They can disappear down that tunnel network when the fighting gets too hot. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1147.76s)]
*  They can booby trap the access points. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1150.76s)]
*  They've got anti-tank weapons. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1154.08s)]
*  They can take out armored vehicles. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1155.88s)]
*  It's going to be a very difficult fight for the Israelis. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1157.96s)]
*  And so they may be taking a pause here just to assess that situation and [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1161.4s)]
*  maybe get organized for it or maybe think better of it. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1166.8400000000001s)]
*  So they may be either stopping to organize or getting cold feet. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1169.52s)]
*  I think second, they have to think through the consequences of going in there. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1174.1200000000001s)]
*  Hezbollah has basically threatened to open up a Northern front and invade [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1178.52s)]
*  Israel if Israel goes into Gaza. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1183.2s)]
*  You also saw, as we saw with the reaction to the hospital bombing, that they have [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1186.84s)]
*  to be concerned about the Arab street erupting. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1192.32s)]
*  And again, if they go into Gaza, this could ignite the whole Arab world. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1195.16s)]
*  It seems to me that if you're Israel, you don't want to become the focal point [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1199.12s)]
*  for all of this anger in the Arab or larger Muslim world. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1204.12s)]
*  There are important differences in that world. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1208.52s)]
*  There's differences between Sunnis and Shiite. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1211.3999999999999s)]
*  There's differences between Arabs and Persians and Turks. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1214.1599999999999s)]
*  And the last thing you want is to paper over all those differences by having [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1219.08s)]
*  everybody's anger targeted at you. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1222.6s)]
*  So I think there's very big consequences that could follow geopolitically. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1225.8s)]
*  I think, again, the war would almost certainly not just be a single front [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1230.56s)]
*  war against Gaza, it could turn into a multi-front war. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1234.48s)]
*  So that's, I think, the second reason. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1237.3999999999999s)]
*  I think the third reason is you have to believe that there's furious diplomacy [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1238.6399999999999s)]
*  going on behind the scenes. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1242.28s)]
*  And I think this is what Chamath is referring to. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1243.48s)]
*  What we don't know, obviously, are the content of those conversations. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1246.72s)]
*  We don't know what the Biden administration has told the Netanyahu government. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1250.56s)]
*  We don't know if they've said to them, listen, we are not going to get involved [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1256.36s)]
*  in this publicly. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1260.6s)]
*  They've said that we stand with Israel, but you just have to wonder what they're [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1261.96s)]
*  privately telling the Israelis. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1265.32s)]
*  All of that being said, I think that Israel has declared that it's at war with Hamas. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1268.12s)]
*  There are these stories that are coming out daily of these atrocities that were [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1273.44s)]
*  perpetrated by Hamas. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1278.12s)]
*  I saw one by paramedics who discovered the bodies and described the way they [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1279.2s)]
*  were tortured, the population of Israel demands retribution. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1282.96s)]
*  And so Netanyahu is under intense domestic political pressure to deliver on that. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1288.32s)]
*  So I think that Chamath is right that things haven't escalated yet, but I [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1295.0800000000002s)]
*  wouldn't say they've de-escalated. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1299.04s)]
*  Blinken did demand and Biden did announce those relieving of some of the [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1300.52s)]
*  humanitarian issues in Gaza. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1305.48s)]
*  But to my knowledge, they have not been implemented yet. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1307.3600000000001s)]
*  They turn the water back on, I believe. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1309.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1311.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1311.96s)]
*  So I think this thing is still a powder keg and it could erupt. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1312.2s)]
*  And again, it all comes back to this key question of does Israel go into Gaza or [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1315.28s)]
*  not? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1320.4s)]
*  If they don't, then I think that creates room for some sort of international [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1321.1200000000001s)]
*  diplomatic effort to get the hostages back and maybe de-escalate the situation. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1326.44s)]
*  And I guess we'll find out over the next week or so. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1332.2s)]
*  And that you didn't even mention that there could be some deep diplomacy here [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1334.48s)]
*  going on in terms of releasing the hostages and maybe somehow they believe if [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1338.0800000000002s)]
*  they go in too early, the chances of getting those hostages out alive could be [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1342.44s)]
*  seriously diminished. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1347.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1348.4s)]
*  You know, it's strange to me that I just don't hear that much about the hostages. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1349.0s)]
*  It seems like the Israeli population, just in terms of what they're publicly [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1352.3600000000001s)]
*  saying, seems to have almost written off the hostages. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1357.24s)]
*  There was some video of the families of the hostages being upset that they don't [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1360.2s)]
*  feel like the government response is adequately taking the interests of their [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1364.52s)]
*  families into account, that they just seem hell bent on this invasion of Gaza. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1368.88s)]
*  But, you know, we don't know what's happening behind the scenes. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1374.8400000000001s)]
*  And again, that would be the way to de-escalate this is you get an international [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1377.44s)]
*  effort to release the hostages in exchange for, maybe it can't be stated, but [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1382.3200000000002s)]
*  quid pro quo where Israel does not go into Gaza on the ground and maybe the [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1388.24s)]
*  bombing stops. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1392.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1393.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1393.92s)]
*  So maybe we can pivot discussion here. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1394.96s)]
*  I will say, let me make one other point here. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1398.44s)]
*  Delving into the internal politics of another country is not something that we [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1400.88s)]
*  typically like to do or that Americans are particularly good at. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1404.72s)]
*  But when a situation like this happens, that could drag us into a war. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1408.0400000000002s)]
*  We do have to kind of understand the internal dynamics of these countries. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1413.48s)]
*  Israel is a country that for the last several years has been very internally [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1416.8s)]
*  divided. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1421.04s)]
*  There's been something like five elections in the last four years. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1421.52s)]
*  Netanyahu got reelected in December of 2022 by creating a new coalition with [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1426.2s)]
*  far-right elements of the Israeli political system. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1434.24s)]
*  And Chamath, you mentioned the Al Aqsa Mosque. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1438.52s)]
*  And I know Jared's take on this was that he thought that this was blown out of [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1441.44s)]
*  proportion, but I'll give you a different perspective on this. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1447.1200000000001s)]
*  I've just been researching this. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1450.0s)]
*  If you read Al Jazeera, what they point to is the emergence of a far-right figure [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1451.44s)]
*  named Itamar Ben-Gavir, who has become a member of Netanyahu's government as a [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1459.2800000000002s)]
*  result of this coalition that was forged in December. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1465.88s)]
*  And Ben-Gavir has been, previously he was a fringe sort of anti-Palestinian [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1470.16s)]
*  far-right provocateur. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1476.48s)]
*  When he was 19 years old, he basically had somehow stolen or taken the hood [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1478.2s)]
*  ornament from Yitzhak Rabin, the then prime minister's car, and was waving it [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1482.88s)]
*  around saying that if we can get to your car, we can get to you. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1487.92s)]
*  Three weeks later, Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a far-right religious [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1490.6000000000001s)]
*  extremist in Israel because they felt that he had committed treason by signing [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1496.36s)]
*  the Al-Azluwá courts. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1500.8799999999999s)]
*  Now, Ben-Gavir wasn't implicated himself, but it gives you a sense of kind of [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1502.04s)]
*  where he's coming from. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1506.56s)]
*  And Ben-Gavir has led over the past year, several incursions into the Al Aqsa [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1508.0s)]
*  Mosque area. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1513.76s)]
*  And the reason he said he's done this is to show that the Al Aqsa Mosque and the [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1515.8s)]
*  Dome of the Rock near the Haram al-Sharif, which is the third holiest site in [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1521.72s)]
*  Islam after Mecca and Medina, he says that that is under the sovereignty of [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1525.6s)]
*  Israel, that that belongs to Israel. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1530.56s)]
*  There is also a faction of the Israeli far-right that wants to build the third [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1532.6399999999999s)]
*  temple on the Temple Mount. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1536.8799999999999s)]
*  You have to understand that that cannot happen while the Al Aqsa Mosque is still [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1538.76s)]
*  there. So you have these, I don't mind saying, crazies. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1543.0s)]
*  I mean, to destroy or even to imply that you would ever destroy the Al Aqsa Mosque [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1547.6799999999998s)]
*  is such an explosive issue. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1554.3999999999999s)]
*  It would turn the entire Muslim world against Israel. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1556.6799999999998s)]
*  And basically, I think it would be the end of Israel. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1559.04s)]
*  But you have these figures who've now been incorporated into Netanyahu's cabinet. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1561.6s)]
*  And they are, I think, far to the right of Netanyahu, but they are preferring [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1566.8s)]
*  Netanyahu. They seem to be baying for some sort of religious war. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1571.56s)]
*  So, you know, the domestic policies of another country is not something that we're [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1575.56s)]
*  totally familiar with. But you have to understand that Israel does have these [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1578.9199999999998s)]
*  elements. And, man, I hope that the Biden administration is telling [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1582.0s)]
*  Netanyahu that, yeah, we stand with Israel, but not if you're going to follow [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1588.72s)]
*  the advice of these far-right religious extremists. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1594.04s)]
*  This is, I think, a very important point to pause on here and maybe unpack, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1597.52s)]
*  which is, as I said, I'm here in Dubai and had this trip planned. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1602.64s)]
*  And I'm actually... [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1608.72s)]
*  Tell us what you're hearing. What are you hearing? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1609.8s)]
*  What do people say? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1612.04s)]
*  Yes, fascinating. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1614.0s)]
*  And this is going to get a little touchy. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1615.88s)]
*  And so I just want to be clear. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1618.84s)]
*  I'm going to tell people what the conversations are here. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1620.6s)]
*  It's not necessarily me endorsing any of these positions. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1624.04s)]
*  And, of course, I'm no expert. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1626.96s)]
*  Of course. And on Saturday night, I went to a bat mitzvah. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1628.52s)]
*  My friends' daughters had their bat mitzvah. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1631.52s)]
*  And Tuesday night, I had dinner. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1634.48s)]
*  Sorry, where? In Israel? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1636.88s)]
*  No, in the Bay Area. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1638.04s)]
*  And then I flew here and this juxtaposition where I had dinner [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1639.44s)]
*  last night with five Jordanians who are of Palestinian descent. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1643.8400000000001s)]
*  And they universally are appalled by Hamas and they're what happened. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1648.76s)]
*  Right. So just say that right out front. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1656.28s)]
*  And then they are perplexed why there is no discussion in the West, in America, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1660.2s)]
*  of the conditions that could have led to this and the treatment of the [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1665.6399999999999s)]
*  Palestinian people who they believe are living in apartheid. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1670.32s)]
*  And that word is used over and over again. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1674.36s)]
*  And that they have, you know, now a generation of people who have no hope [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1677.1599999999999s)]
*  and a generation of people who have nothing to lose and that they have [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1681.28s)]
*  nothing to live for. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1684.96s)]
*  And this is the piece of the discussion that has gotten a lot of people in the [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1686.08s)]
*  West, I think, in trouble talking about it. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1690.72s)]
*  We had a conference producer who was tweeting, hey, listen, you know, very [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1692.52s)]
*  early on, like on the 10-7, Israel has to abide by, you know, international law, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1698.0s)]
*  et cetera. And this came up over and over again from Muslims here in Dubai, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1705.44s)]
*  that the West is not in the free world, is not holding Israel accountable to [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1712.2s)]
*  human rights standards, basic standard tenets of war. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1718.0s)]
*  And I was coming into the trip a little bit more positive. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1720.52s)]
*  And now there's such a deep hurt on both sides of this that I got to see, you [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1723.6s)]
*  know, from from both of these events and people suffering that I, my normally [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1729.32s)]
*  positive outlook has been a little bit shaken, if I'm being honest. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1735.0s)]
*  This feels very intractable to me. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1739.56s)]
*  And, yeah, to even go near the topic of what has Israel contributed to this [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1742.16s)]
*  situation and the treatment of the Palestinian people, that's what the [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1749.52s)]
*  people in the region want to hear us talk about, or just hear the world talk [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1753.3600000000001s)]
*  about. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1758.44s)]
*  Any reaction to some of the protests that happened in Europe and the people [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1758.76s)]
*  that took to the streets? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1763.48s)]
*  What was their perspective on that? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1764.4s)]
*  I think their perspective is a very small percentage of Americans care about [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1765.68s)]
*  the Palestinian people. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1770.8s)]
*  And, you know, if you look at the surveys that have gone on and I have some of [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1772.9599999999998s)]
*  the survey data that's been done, and I'm not sure Americans views on this are [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1777.32s)]
*  the most important views for us to be focused on, but a very small percentage [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1784.0s)]
*  of people are aligned with the Palestinian people as opposed to the [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1788.6s)]
*  state of Israel. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1794.0s)]
*  So, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1794.6s)]
*  well, I mean, the biggest challenge in finding a path towards, I don't want to [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1794.92s)]
*  just be so generic and say the word peace. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1802.44s)]
*  No, I think that's the word, yeah. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1804.5200000000002s)]
*  But towards some form of understanding and settlement with each other is that [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1805.68s)]
*  there's a framing right now that you have to pick a side. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1809.72s)]
*  You're not allowed to be pro-Israel and also be sympathetic and empathetic to [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1813.6000000000001s)]
*  the plight of the children in Gaza. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1820.16s)]
*  You're not allowed to say, I'm looking out for the Palestinians, but I believe [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1822.3200000000002s)]
*  Israel should have a state. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1827.6000000000001s)]
*  You're not allowed to point out the fact that there are multiple Muslim majority [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1829.88s)]
*  countries and there was only one Jewish state while also saying that what the [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1835.6000000000001s)]
*  Israelis have done may also not be right. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1841.3200000000002s)]
*  You're not allowed to take a nuanced point of view and you're not allowed to [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1846.0s)]
*  address the variance in behavior over time with each of these different sides [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1849.68s)]
*  and how there is a massive complicated mess here that it has to be pick your [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1856.0800000000002s)]
*  side, you're pro-Israeli, we need to wipe out X, Y or Z or you're anti-Israeli [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1861.0400000000002s)]
*  and as a result, you're anti-Semite. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1867.0800000000002s)]
*  And the fact that we conflate all of these things together and force people to [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1869.8000000000002s)]
*  jump on a side is what is also escalating that we can't actually have [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1874.1200000000001s)]
*  conversations around these topics, that it all ends up being pick a side and [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1877.28s)]
*  then let's figure out how many people and what resources are on one side and what [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1882.16s)]
*  people and what resources are on the other. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1885.68s)]
*  And I think that this notion that we have almost a cancel culture behavior that's [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1888.32s)]
*  now leached into this discourse, that if you try and talk about the plight of [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1892.72s)]
*  Palestinians, you cannot also be pro-Israel is what's keeping us from making progress [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1898.68s)]
*  in finding a path to resolution. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1905.64s)]
*  And I think that's the biggest issue right now. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1907.6000000000001s)]
*  And we leverage the, you're not a loyalist, you're not moral, you're not a good [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1910.0400000000002s)]
*  person, you're evil if you don't stand on our side and both sides are act that way. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1917.24s)]
*  And it's, that's the hardest thing to change. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1926.68s)]
*  It's, I think the only way to find a path is to change that first. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1929.3600000000001s)]
*  And I think starting with empathy is the only way, but man, that's impossible right [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1934.24s)]
*  now, fucking impossible. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1937.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1939.92s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1940.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1940.88s)]
*  I'm just, I'm just super like, wow, I'm super emotional about this because I just [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1941.28s)]
*  don't like the, like, you know. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1944.16s)]
*  So there are broadly speaking, two factions that we're seeing out in the [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1946.5600000000002s)]
*  streets, either denouncing Israel or supporting the Palestinians. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1952.16s)]
*  I think there is a group of people who genuinely hate Jews or hate Israel and do [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1956.68s)]
*  not believe in Israel's right to exist and are preaching things like decolonization, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1961.76s)]
*  which is a recipe for genocide. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1966.92s)]
*  Then there are people and probably a larger group who I think are concerned with the [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1969.68s)]
*  plight of the Palestinian people who recognize the conditions they have as deplorable. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1974.8799999999999s)]
*  And that the tactics that Israel uses to enforce its security, whether it's the [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1979.56s)]
*  occupation of the West Bank or the blockade of Gaza are unsustainable and [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1985.12s)]
*  create unfair conditions for the Palestinians. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1991.12s)]
*  So in other words, they're not saying that Israel doesn't have a right to exist. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1994.4399999999998s)]
*  They are principally concerned with helping the Palestinians and [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=1997.6799999999998s)]
*  achieving a Palestinian state. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2001.28s)]
*  It seems to me a paramount importance that Israel separate these two groups by [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2003.76s)]
*  understanding the concern, and I would apply this to American leadership as well, by [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2012.12s)]
*  understanding the concerns of the latter and hopefully getting us on a path to [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2016.28s)]
*  resolving them so as to isolate the haters. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2021.88s)]
*  Totally. Because otherwise, this whole thing is headed towards a gigantic disaster [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2026.2s)]
*  where, and I think it's a disaster for Israel most of all, is that Israel could be [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2031.0s)]
*  destroyed. But I think the whole world is being asked to pick a side, too. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2036.1200000000001s)]
*  And that's where this escalates into a much bigger, broader conflict. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2039.52s)]
*  It's that every country, and even within the US, we're being asked to pick a side. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2042.56s)]
*  And now we're seeing civil unrest in the US. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2047.32s)]
*  The frustration as well amongst people who are Muslim or who are Palestinian, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2049.36s)]
*  descendant or Jordanian, or just in the region generally, is that Hamas set this [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2056.04s)]
*  process back decades. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2060.64s)]
*  And there's like a great frustration that maybe some progress was being made and [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2062.68s)]
*  that we could come to some normalcy in a two-state solution and that Hamas did this [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2066.6s)]
*  exactly because so much progress has been made recently. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2071.92s)]
*  I think that is the best theory about why this happened now is that there was a [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2077.44s)]
*  process of normalization happening between Israel and a number of these Arab [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2081.04s)]
*  states. And we talked about it last week that Jared Kushner set this in motion. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2085.2799999999997s)]
*  There were three or four deals that were signed between Israel and the Gulf Arab [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2089.96s)]
*  states bringing about normal relations. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2093.7599999999998s)]
*  And Saudi Arabia was on the table as being the next one. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2096.72s)]
*  There was an effort underway to negotiate a normalization of relations between [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2100.0s)]
*  Israel and Saudi Arabia that is now completely on ice. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2106.56s)]
*  And at risk of the other agreements maybe being ripped up because if Israel goes in [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2110.68s)]
*  and has a massive ground invasion and there's more suffering and death, that that [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2117.4s)]
*  will maybe blow all those accords up. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2121.56s)]
*  I think that what Hamas may have been concerned about, to the extent you want to [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2124.0s)]
*  impute strategic logic to their decisions, even those decisions are atrocities. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2127.72s)]
*  But if they have a strategic purpose in mind, it's to derail that process of [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2132.7599999999998s)]
*  normalization because if the entire Arab world basically normalizes relations with [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2138.16s)]
*  Israel before the Palestinian question is resolved, it takes a major carrot off the [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2142.08s)]
*  table in their negotiations or whatever they want to achieve. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2148.64s)]
*  So I think that to thwart that process was a big part of the goal here. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2152.16s)]
*  But I do think that what this has shown is that getting to a larger Middle East [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2158.24s)]
*  peace without resolving the Palestinian question is likely to be a failed strategy. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2164.08s)]
*  I just don't, it's impossible. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2170.2s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2171.56s)]
*  And so again, this does not justify anything Hamas did, but I think that what [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2172.3999999999996s)]
*  these events have now created is a dynamic where the Palestinian question is now [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2177.9199999999996s)]
*  front and center and everything else is basically paused until this gets resolved. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2185.64s)]
*  Now, I just want to say something about the two state process. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2190.68s)]
*  You know, again, I was doing some research. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2193.8399999999997s)]
*  There rarely hasn't been any work on the two state solution for roughly a decade. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2196.68s)]
*  Obama was the last president who tried. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2202.4s)]
*  He explicitly said that Israel should try to make peace based on the 1967 lines, but [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2204.56s)]
*  with land swaps to accommodate for the changes that have happened on the map. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2209.56s)]
*  Since then Netanyahu was very irate at that formulation, by the way. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2213.76s)]
*  He never had a good relationship with Obama because of that. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2217.48s)]
*  And then John Kerry, who is secretary under Obama made a major effort to try [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2220.76s)]
*  and bring about a two state solution. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2226.04s)]
*  And frankly, it went nowhere. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2227.84s)]
*  And a big part of the reason why is that Netanyahu said that, listen, the only [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2229.4s)]
*  situation that's acceptable to Israel from a security standpoint is that we must [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2236.52s)]
*  control all security west of the Jordan River. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2241.56s)]
*  So in other words, we must control security in the West Bank. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2244.48s)]
*  And his argument was that look, adjacent land is very important. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2247.96s)]
*  If you create a Palestinian state there where they have total sovereignty over [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2251.36s)]
*  their own security, they could be digging tunnels under the wall. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2255.88s)]
*  He basically said it could turn into 20 Gazas and he's got his point of view. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2259.24s)]
*  And when people challenged him on this, he said, listen, you don't live here. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2263.2s)]
*  You know, we live here. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2267.0s)]
*  We understand the security situation. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2267.96s)]
*  That's what he said to John Kerry. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2269.56s)]
*  So the whole process fell apart. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2271.32s)]
*  And since then, the idea has been for Israel to move forward again on this [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2272.8s)]
*  larger normalization project with the rest of the Middle East, putting the [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2278.5600000000004s)]
*  Palestinian question to one side. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2282.76s)]
*  The idea has basically been, listen, if you won't make peace with us, and this [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2284.8s)]
*  goes back to Arafat at Camp David, turning down the deal that was on the table that [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2288.04s)]
*  Clinton brokered with Ehud Barak. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2293.28s)]
*  If you won't make a deal with us, we'll just go around you. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2296.52s)]
*  You're too rejections. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2298.84s)]
*  You're too difficult. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2299.76s)]
*  You're too hard to make a deal with. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2300.52s)]
*  So we're just going to put that to one side. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2301.84s)]
*  And that really has been the process for the last decade, I would say, since John [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2304.44s)]
*  Kerry's initiative fell apart, the process has been starting with pushing [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2311.08s)]
*  under Trump, and then I think Biden tried to extend it by brokering the Saudi Arabia [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2316.68s)]
*  deal. The idea was let's put the Palestinian question to one side. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2320.96s)]
*  We'll work on these other deals. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2325.0s)]
*  I think now that that process has fallen apart. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2326.32s)]
*  So the two-state solution, that process died back in 2014. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2330.0s)]
*  This idea of going around has basically fallen apart now. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2334.36s)]
*  And so I think this is why people are pretty pessimistic about where things go from [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2338.04s)]
*  here is what is the process? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2341.52s)]
*  And meanwhile, you have this hard shift inside Israeli domestic politics to the [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2344.0s)]
*  right. You've got these religious factions who believe that the entirety of the West [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2348.64s)]
*  Bank, what they call Judea and Sumeria, is their God-given right. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2353.88s)]
*  And if you go back to the Netanyahu's government forming in December of 2022, the [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2357.88s)]
*  first plank was to say that Judea and Sumeria belong to us. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2364.16s)]
*  We have sovereignty over them. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2368.6s)]
*  We're not giving them up. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2369.7599999999998s)]
*  So what room is there for compromise? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2371.12s)]
*  And since then, they've been expanding the settlements in the West Bank. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2372.92s)]
*  Let me ask you a question just to shift the question for a second. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2376.0s)]
*  The thing that surprised me the most over this past week were the extent of the [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2379.48s)]
*  protests, some violent in the United States and in Western Europe. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2387.8s)]
*  And I'm curious to hear from you guys. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2395.04s)]
*  Was that overwhelmingly about pro-Palestine and making sure that there wasn't a [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2397.2400000000002s)]
*  human rights atrocity in Gaza? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2403.0s)]
*  Or was that a emergence of like a simmering anti-Semitism that we hadn't seen? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2404.92s)]
*  Well, both. That's kind of my point is there's type one and type two. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2413.36s)]
*  Type one is the true hatred. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2416.52s)]
*  It's the denial of the Israeli right to exist. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2418.88s)]
*  However, there is a type two, which is legitimate concern over the condition of the [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2421.2s)]
*  Palestinians and the desire to resolve that by creating a Palestinian state. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2425.16s)]
*  And until you separate those two things, you're never going to make progress. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2429.8s)]
*  Your type two can breed a type one is the real scary reality. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2432.8399999999997s)]
*  The simmering anti-Semitism. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2438.2799999999997s)]
*  That you can have a legitimate concern about the people of Palestine because you [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2440.72s)]
*  always are going to be concerned about the oppressed being oppressed by the oppressor. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2445.9199999999996s)]
*  And that then translates into an anti-Semitism because you say that it's the Jewish people [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2451.8399999999997s)]
*  that are perpetrating this upon those people. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2457.04s)]
*  Therefore, the Jewish people need to go. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2460.08s)]
*  And I've heard friends of mine in the last week who have said awful things like all [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2463.6800000000003s)]
*  Muslims need to go. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2468.28s)]
*  Well-known, well-respected public people have said this to me in private. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2470.0s)]
*  I can see where the hatred can come from a place of hurt. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2474.48s)]
*  I can see that when people feel sympathetic towards the Palestinian plight, they can [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2478.76s)]
*  then turn into anti-Semitism. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2483.28s)]
*  And so I do think that there are two distinct groups today, but my concern is that just [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2485.8s)]
*  like what happened in the past, that that can then breed into a more generalized, more [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2490.56s)]
*  fiery and more scary situation where it really is anti something genocidal on both sides, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2496.88s)]
*  by the way. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2505.48s)]
*  I think what we're describing here is a classic vicious cycle where you start with [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2506.28s)]
*  there's conditions of occupation that breeds resistance, that breeds extremism. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2511.84s)]
*  Extremism breeds fear on the part of Israelis because they get attacked. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2518.28s)]
*  And then that breeds harsher security conditions. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2523.0s)]
*  The next level of occupation or blockade. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2526.1600000000003s)]
*  And then the cycle continues. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2528.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2530.52s)]
*  And so the question is how you break that cycle, because the Israelis right now, and [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2531.0800000000004s)]
*  I'm sure Netanyahu would make this point, if we open things up, if we gave you a Palestinian [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2536.1600000000003s)]
*  state, what's to stop 30,000 Hamas fighters? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2540.28s)]
*  If we opened up the walls around Gaza, what's to stop 30,000 Hamas fighters from [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2544.6000000000004s)]
*  massacring us in our homes? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2549.8s)]
*  And if you do a ground invasion, are you inspiring more radicalization? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2552.36s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2557.7200000000003s)]
*  And so for every person you kill, they've got brothers, they've got sisters, they've [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2559.76s)]
*  got parents, they've got kids, they've got aunts and uncles, and they become the next [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2563.6800000000003s)]
*  generation of extremists. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2568.0s)]
*  How does the cycle break, I think is the frustrating part here. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2570.6s)]
*  And just looking at the reaction in the US, we saw a lot of discussion over young [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2574.24s)]
*  students writing arguments that Israel had brought this on themselves and were solely [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2585.44s)]
*  responsible for the Hamas attack. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2590.44s)]
*  And this has led to massive outrage amongst donors to Ivy League schools like Penn and [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2592.96s)]
*  Harvard. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2601.6800000000003s)]
*  And obviously those have very large endowments. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2602.36s)]
*  And this is now leading to many of them pulling out of commitments they've made. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2605.88s)]
*  The Wexner Foundation, founded by Victoria Secrets billionaire, said it's breaking off [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2613.92s)]
*  ties with Harvard. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2619.84s)]
*  Edan Ofer, quit the executive board of Harvard's Kennedy School, said it was Ken Griffin, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2622.36s)]
*  who's donated more than half a billion dollars to Harvard, placed a call away last week [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2627.4s)]
*  to the head of Harvard and asked the university to come out in support of Israel. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2631.28s)]
*  And then more than a dozen anonymous donors told the New York Times they felt they had [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2635.76s)]
*  a right and an obligation to weigh in here. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2639.84s)]
*  And before this all happened at Penn, donors had started pulling out because of a [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2642.36s)]
*  Palestinian rights festival that happened two weeks before the events of 10-7. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2647.52s)]
*  From September 22 to 24, the UPenn hosted the Palestine Rights Literature Festival. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2654.12s)]
*  The festival was billed as a gathering to explore the richness and diversity of [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2659.48s)]
*  Palestinian culture. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2663.28s)]
*  But according to multiple sources, it mostly focused on Jews, Israel and Zionism. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2664.6800000000003s)]
*  One speaker called for ethnic cleansing of Jews. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2668.84s)]
*  Another said violence was a necessity. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2671.96s)]
*  Any thoughts, Chamath? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2674.04s)]
*  We were talking last week about these woke madrasas and then I guess this is the second [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2675.08s)]
*  order and third order effects coming into play. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2679.24s)]
*  If you said it more generically, this would be a perfect opportunity for these leading [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2681.2799999999997s)]
*  universities to actually provide nuance and teach people the history of both sides and [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2686.44s)]
*  to show. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2694.68s)]
*  The perspective of both sides. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2697.4s)]
*  That would take leadership. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2699.16s)]
*  Yeah, that would take courageous leadership on the part of the people who run the [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2700.08s)]
*  university. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2703.72s)]
*  Let's just be honest. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2704.76s)]
*  I think these elite universities are essentially asset management businesses that have an [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2705.6800000000003s)]
*  education, the thick leaf of education wrapped around them. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2712.4s)]
*  So they're more like BlackRock than they are like a school. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2715.84s)]
*  And so they behave like any for-profit asset manager would, which is that I think that [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2720.32s)]
*  as they didn't try to intervene in one way or the other over the last 15 or 20 years, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2725.1200000000003s)]
*  in actually making sure that they were graduating the best kids. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2731.68s)]
*  So instead, what happened is they get hijacked by professors and people who wanted one very [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2734.92s)]
*  specific strain of thinking. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2741.92s)]
*  And I don't think it matters which strain it is, but it betrays what the point of a [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2743.48s)]
*  leading university is supposed to be. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2748.44s)]
*  And then as a result, the people that graduate from these places are close minded. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2750.16s)]
*  And what that does is that that screws America because you have all of these other places [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2754.3599999999997s)]
*  graduating kids with a different mindset who then go and build the things that matter. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2759.88s)]
*  And America just keeps falling back. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2764.28s)]
*  And we are just slower and we're not intellectually capable of thinking in a way that [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2766.56s)]
*  allows us to see more than just what's right in front of us. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2772.56s)]
*  So I don't know what you want me to say. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2775.76s)]
*  It's just like these. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2777.6400000000003s)]
*  No, I'm just it's a follow up to what we talked about last week. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2778.6400000000003s)]
*  And so I thought it was pertinent. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2783.1200000000003s)]
*  And so I thought it was pertinent. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2784.92s)]
*  Sax looking at the free speech issue, there was some pushback online. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2787.28s)]
*  Again, not my position. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2793.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm just putting it out here for you to comment on sex, which is blacklisting young college [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2794.5600000000004s)]
*  students who had an opinion about Palestine is wrong. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2800.48s)]
*  And you're trying to cancel people, which are response to holding people accountable or [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2804.6000000000004s)]
*  canceling these students for their positions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2810.08s)]
*  Well, what's happening now is that these campuses that took outrageous positions on this [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2816.04s)]
*  whole issue are now trying to wrap themselves in the cloak of academic freedom as if that's a [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2823.16s)]
*  value they've been respecting. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2827.6s)]
*  Free speech is not a value they've been respecting. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2829.16s)]
*  Free speech is a value they've been imposing. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2831.36s)]
*  And this was revealed by a survey that was just done, the FIRE survey that surveyed [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2833.88s)]
*  students on 248 campuses on a range of free speech issues. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2840.7200000000003s)]
*  So it asked them about how comfortable do you feel expressing your views on controversial [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2846.12s)]
*  topics? What is the tolerance on campus for liberal speakers or conservative speakers? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2851.64s)]
*  How acceptable is it to engage in disruptive conduct against the speaker on campus, such [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2857.96s)]
*  as shouting them down to prevent them from speaking? [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2863.36s)]
*  What sort of administrative support do different views get on campus? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2866.48s)]
*  And how open is the campus to hearing about different issues? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2870.0s)]
*  And what they found was that the most elite schools ranked the worst. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2874.0s)]
*  The only elite private school to score above average on free speech was University of [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2880.0s)]
*  Chicago, which got a score of about 65 out of 100, which made them ranked number 13 [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2884.92s)]
*  overall. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2891.2000000000003s)]
*  The rest of the top schools, the Ivies, were abysmal. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2892.8399999999997s)]
*  Brown ranked number 69, Duke ranked 124, Princeton ranked 187, Stanford ranked 207. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2897.48s)]
*  This is, again, out of a total number of 248. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2904.2799999999997s)]
*  And Penn, which is where the donors are up in arm, ranked second to last, number 247. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2909.96s)]
*  They scored 11 points on the survey. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2917.52s)]
*  And then Harvard finished 248 out of 248 schools ranked, also known as dead last. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2920.36s)]
*  And get this, the rating in the survey was zero point zero. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2927.32s)]
*  They scored a blue Tarski. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2931.4s)]
*  Zero point zero. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2933.88s)]
*  Remember Blue Tarski in Animal House? [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2935.32s)]
*  He scored zero point zero. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2937.7200000000003s)]
*  Harvard scored zero point zero. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2940.08s)]
*  Point zero. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2941.96s)]
*  Yes. So look, I think it would be it would be one thing if these [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2944.2400000000002s)]
*  schools said to the alumni, we agree with you that some of these speakers were over [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2949.8s)]
*  the top, but this is what academic freedom is all about. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2955.5600000000004s)]
*  But they have no standing to say anything like that because they have been suppressing [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2958.6800000000003s)]
*  views on campus. They've been allowing speakers to be shouted down. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2963.92s)]
*  They have been stifling the presentation of alternative views. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2967.88s)]
*  So this is clearly these types of speakers, these types of views that I think absolutely [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2971.04s)]
*  crossed the line from again what we talked about, which is type two support for legitimate [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2976.48s)]
*  support for a Palestinian state into hatred of Israel and Jews and denying the right to [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2981.68s)]
*  exist. It absolutely crossed over. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2987.28s)]
*  And many of these cases is a outrageous talk given by I think a Cornell professor who [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2989.48s)]
*  was outright praising this massacre. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2995.48s)]
*  God, that was disturbing. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2998.2400000000002s)]
*  So look, it is not the case. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3000.4s)]
*  Yes, he was. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3002.84s)]
*  So look, I think that these alumni have a point in saying that you, these elite campuses, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3003.84s)]
*  have been clearly putting your thumb on the scale in favor of certain views. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3010.84s)]
*  You've been suppressing certain views. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3015.1200000000003s)]
*  So this must be a view that you either share or endorse or permit given that the rest of [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3016.88s)]
*  your speech regime is so restrictive and oppressive. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3024.6000000000004s)]
*  So even though I would in a different circumstance, support academic freedom, I think [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3027.92s)]
*  these colleges have a leg to stand on. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3033.28s)]
*  All right. We're going to talk about some other topics today because that's what we do on [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3035.36s)]
*  the All In podcast. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3039.6000000000004s)]
*  And so tangentially related to the speech issues in the EU, officials held a meeting to [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3040.7200000000003s)]
*  discuss enforcement of the DSA, or Digital Services Act. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3046.96s)]
*  For some background here, the EU's Digital Services Act updated the EU's Electronic [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3051.52s)]
*  Commerce Directive of 2000, which was inspired by Section 230 here in the United States. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3056.5600000000004s)]
*  Common carrier laws where the common carriers, be those AOL, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, are [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3062.4s)]
*  not responsible for what individuals post on their platforms. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3068.32s)]
*  And so that protection has been critically important, not making social media sites or [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3073.12s)]
*  WordPress into editors or having them have to censor content on their platform. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3078.08s)]
*  So the DSA officially went into effect in August of this year. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3084.48s)]
*  The main goal was to quote unquote, foster safer online environments. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3088.16s)]
*  The DSA aims to do that via tighter rules around disinformation, illegal content, and [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3094.16s)]
*  transparent advertising. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3101.12s)]
*  Those last two not controversial. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3102.64s)]
*  That first one, disinformation, is obviously the one that's going to be pretty challenging. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3104.7999999999997s)]
*  The DSA has been called a new constitution of the internet in an effort to shape the [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3109.68s)]
*  future of the online world. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3114.24s)]
*  Some things the DSA covers, it forces VLOPS, a new term, very large online platforms, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3116.48s)]
*  disclose how their algorithms work. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3124.56s)]
*  They must give users the right to opt out of recommendation systems and profiling. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3126.96s)]
*  They must share key data with researchers and authorities. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3130.88s)]
*  They must cooperate with crisis response requirements, and they must perform external [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3133.76s)]
*  and internal audits. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3138.08s)]
*  They want to force transparency on how content moderation decisions are made. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3139.36s)]
*  That seems logical. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3143.84s)]
*  They want to force transparency on the ways advertising is targeted. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3145.44s)]
*  That also seems reasonable. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3148.88s)]
*  And then they want ways to flag illegal content. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3151.6s)]
*  Obviously, obligations around protecting minors. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3154.88s)]
*  I don't think anybody will debate those, but it forces them to cooperate with specialized [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3158.56s)]
*  trusted flaggers to identify and remove this illegal content. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3163.44s)]
*  I don't know who those people would be. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3166.7200000000003s)]
*  Freberg, you had some thoughts? [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3169.52s)]
*  My thoughts are that the era of the open internet as a decentralized technology platform for [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3170.72s)]
*  the benefit of individuals and not to be overseen and run by governments is over. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3178.96s)]
*  The Digital Services Act, I think, is one of the most overreaching threats to any sort of [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3186.24s)]
*  open, transparent, democratic opportunity on the internet. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3195.2s)]
*  The idea of the open internet, the idea of creating a network of computers that could [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3200.4s)]
*  share information and make services available to individuals around the world freely, uncensored, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3206.8s)]
*  and in an easy to access way was the reason that the internet has transformed society, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3215.36s)]
*  improved productivity, and provided extraordinary benefits. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3221.68s)]
*  The Digital Services Act is an example of a government seeing that a decentralized [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3226.2400000000002s)]
*  technology, the internet itself is meant to be a decentralized technology. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3233.04s)]
*  There's no central servers. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3236.96s)]
*  They are all part of a network of computers that anyone on the network can access anything [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3238.4s)]
*  else on the network. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3243.12s)]
*  Blockchain, obviously, is the more modern, exciting, decentralized technology concept [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3244.8s)]
*  that is meant to avoid the scrutiny, the oversight, and the control by central [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3251.2s)]
*  governments or central authorities of any sort. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3256.3199999999997s)]
*  The language in the Digital Services Act, I think, got squeezed through in a way that [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3261.12s)]
*  most of the people that I'm guessing passed this Digital Services Act don't fully comprehend [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3265.2799999999997s)]
*  the implications of some of the decisions that they're making. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3270.0s)]
*  It can be easily framed as this is good for people. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3272.64s)]
*  You cannot sell illegal content online. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3276.3999999999996s)]
*  You cannot sell illegal goods and services. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3278.72s)]
*  We're trying to safeguard young people. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3281.12s)]
*  But the protection of minors means that you can no longer do personalized web experiences [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3283.7599999999998s)]
*  for anyone under 18, which means you need to know the age of everyone. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3289.92s)]
*  And now your web experience, if you're a kid, is not going to be personalized. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3293.2s)]
*  The overreach gets even worse when they say we can now go in and run evaluations of the [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3296.8s)]
*  algorithms and allow open access to your data to third party researchers to get into your [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3304.8s)]
*  systems and look at how you guys are running the services that you're offering on the [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3310.64s)]
*  internet. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3313.8399999999997s)]
*  So not only are you no longer allowed to have an open internet where people can provide [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3314.56s)]
*  whatever services they want to provide, but if you're on the internet, you now have to [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3318.08s)]
*  make your service and the inside part of your service available for scrutiny by governments. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3322.24s)]
*  And researchers, who are these researchers? [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3327.2799999999997s)]
*  Sounds like a Stasi type thing. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3330.08s)]
*  The way it's written, it gives this commission as the primary regulator effectively a lot of [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3332.08s)]
*  leeway in deciding who, what, where and how they can go into companies, go into individual [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3337.52s)]
*  servers, individual computers. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3344.08s)]
*  I could run an individual company on my computer at home and it gives this government the legal [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3346.24s)]
*  right in the EU to go into my computer and pull information out of my computer and scrutinize it [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3351.28s)]
*  and make decisions about what I'm doing and whether or not I'm compliant with whatever the [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3356.96s)]
*  commission's enforcement standards are of that day. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3361.44s)]
*  I mean, this is about as 1984 as you can get, and it's a real serious threat. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3364.08s)]
*  I don't think people are recognizing the second and third order effects of what this is going to [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3368.08s)]
*  do over time to internet services, to the quality of experience we get on the internet [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3372.4s)]
*  and to the role that government is now going to play in policing, scrutinizing and providing [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3377.8399999999997s)]
*  restricted access to content and services for each individual that wants to use the internet. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3383.2s)]
*  But it's important to say if you're a European, it'll just make Europe even more of a place you [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3387.04s)]
*  go to vacation and never to live. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3391.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3393.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3394.08s)]
*  I mean, we're not talking about America, right? [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3394.4s)]
*  We're talking about Europe. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3396.64s)]
*  This is all the changes that are going to happen inside of Google, which is going to affect more [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3397.52s)]
*  than just the EU users because of the requests and the demands of the EU. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3401.36s)]
*  And so, you know, the services that you are going to get around the world are going to be affected [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3406.48s)]
*  by this EU compliance regime and it's going to be dynamic. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3410.56s)]
*  It's a commission, basically a bunch of individuals that get to decide who, what, where and how. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3413.28s)]
*  That's going to create a really scary, scary situation where a bunch of people who are going [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3419.12s)]
*  to have their own motivations, their own political leanings, their own objectives, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3426.7999999999997s)]
*  they're going to be able to leverage their particular role in applying their particular [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3432.3999999999996s)]
*  biases to internet services. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3438.24s)]
*  We saw Canada do something similar and Facebook's reaction was we're not going to syndicate links. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3439.7599999999998s)]
*  So, I don't know. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3447.04s)]
*  I would go back to another argument you make a lot, which I agree with, which is [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3448.32s)]
*  the free market will act rationally here. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3452.56s)]
*  And if Google deprecates a bunch of features and or completely pulls out of Europe, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3454.96s)]
*  that'll be the death knell for these kinds of decisions because then other governments [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3461.04s)]
*  and other people will see the cost of trying to get this kind of control. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3465.44s)]
*  I think the bigger issue in a moment like this is Europe has such a checkered [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3469.36s)]
*  past on these things, which is that they somehow try to find this moral high ground [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3475.12s)]
*  and there is just this overreach and this quasi-central planning that just never works. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3482.3199999999997s)]
*  And so, if this is another example of it, I would encourage all for-profit companies [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3488.96s)]
*  to make the practical decision. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3493.92s)]
*  Oh, can you imagine Google's decision making here? [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3495.44s)]
*  They've got thousands of employees in Europe. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3498.56s)]
*  They make billions of dollars in revenue in the market. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3500.96s)]
*  It's such a difficult situation to be in. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3503.04s)]
*  Not if what you're saying is true. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3505.12s)]
*  Not if what you're saying is this is the threat of the internet. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3507.04s)]
*  I think it'll be very easy for Larry and Sergey to say, cut it, move on. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3509.7599999999998s)]
*  No, Europe is too big a market for Google or any other major tech company to exit. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3513.2s)]
*  There's just no way. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3518.0s)]
*  What they're going to do is comply. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3519.12s)]
*  There won't be a market. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3520.24s)]
*  Well, hold on a second. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3521.2s)]
*  What this new DSA rule does is apply penalties to social networks for [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3522.32s)]
*  not censoring what they call legal speech, which is whatever speech they say it is. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3527.44s)]
*  So, Freeberg's right. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3532.24s)]
*  There's going to be some sort of committee in Brussels that basically [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3533.2s)]
*  sends out takedown requests now to all these social networks. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3535.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's the DSA commission. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3538.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the DSA commission. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3540.16s)]
*  So, Europe, again, is just too big an area not to serve. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3541.2s)]
*  And then what could happen is that because it's easier for companies just to have one [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3546.24s)]
*  approach where they can, there is a risk that these same policies get applied in the US. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3549.9199999999996s)]
*  That is what happened with privacy. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3555.6s)]
*  Remember, Europe went first with GDPR and then a lot of those regulations came to [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3556.7999999999997s)]
*  America. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3561.44s)]
*  Now, the First Amendment may stand in the way here, but there is some risk that [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3562.0s)]
*  tech companies of their own accord decide that it's cheaper and easier to comply [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3567.52s)]
*  with the European regime everywhere than trying to parse their service in different markets. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3572.16s)]
*  I'm just saying that's a risk. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3576.32s)]
*  But look, let me frame it in a different way, in an economic argument. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3577.44s)]
*  Okay, so Europe is about 25 cents of every dollar of revenue that Google generates. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3580.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3586.8s)]
*  So, if you think about that, that's call it 60 odd billion dollars a year, plus or minus. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3587.7000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3593.38s)]
*  So, the question is, at what point is the cost of trying to get 60 billion so great [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3594.34s)]
*  that you say it's not worth the 60 billion? [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3601.3s)]
*  And my point is that there is an economic rational argument here for it. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3604.1800000000003s)]
*  If it costs, for example, 10 or 20 billion dollars to implement this stuff, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3610.9s)]
*  that's probably the efficient frontier where when you factor in multiple compression [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3616.5s)]
*  and you factor in behavior change in Europe, which may actually degrade the 60 billion [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3620.9s)]
*  to 50 or 40, where you just throw your hands up and say it's just not economically worth it. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3625.38s)]
*  You've seen these actors make this trade-off in Canada. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3630.18s)]
*  It's not totally unreasonable that they run a model to figure out the cost. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3632.42s)]
*  Maybe they just take the perspective that whenever this DSA commission sends us a [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3636.9s)]
*  takedown request, we're just going to do it instantly. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3641.22s)]
*  Why wouldn't that just become the norm? [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3643.62s)]
*  In fact, I'm pretty sure that's what they'll do. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3645.38s)]
*  The management of most of these companies, really at all of them, except for Elon, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3647.06s)]
*  they don't really care. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3651.7000000000003s)]
*  They have the same biases. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3652.5s)]
*  Yeah, they're not founders. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3654.82s)]
*  They're not founders. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3657.86s)]
*  They don't care about free speech. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3658.5s)]
*  Moreover, they have a lot of the same political biases that these E.U. commissioners have. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3659.94s)]
*  I'm not supporting the DSA. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3662.9s)]
*  All I'm saying is I think that economic rational actors will do the right thing here. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3664.26s)]
*  I think the most likely outcome is that tech companies will be [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3668.82s)]
*  craven and they'll fold and they'll just do whatever these E.U. commissioners want. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3671.94s)]
*  Which then could be an opportunity for distributed blockchain. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3674.98s)]
*  Good luck with that. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3680.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3681.86s)]
*  It's hard to scale them, but the devil's in the details. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3683.14s)]
*  And you guys feel this every day. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3687.3s)]
*  Like Jason, you're right now in the UAE. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3688.66s)]
*  You can communicate in certain ways through WhatsApp. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3692.1s)]
*  You can't communicate in other ways through iMessage. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3694.5s)]
*  There are just rules of usability on products and they exist all around the world. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3696.58s)]
*  If you go to India, there are certain apps that are blocked and certain apps that are [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3701.22s)]
*  not. And so maybe that's just what happens where there is just a gradient of user experiences [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3704.9s)]
*  around the world for people and we all deal with it. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3709.7000000000003s)]
*  We don't know exactly how heavy-handed they're going to be here. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3712.26s)]
*  This is by definition heavy-handed. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3716.26s)]
*  I don't agree with it, but hold on. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3717.86s)]
*  We don't know what... [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3720.9s)]
*  This is the problem with how they've done this. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3723.3s)]
*  This is all being done in a star chamber. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3724.98s)]
*  We don't have any insight into what kind of content they want to take down. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3726.7400000000002s)]
*  If it's obviously abusive content, fine. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3730.34s)]
*  But if it's COVID information or misinformation, obviously there's going to be a problem [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3733.62s)]
*  that we saw here in the United States. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3739.7s)]
*  Just so people know... [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3741.54s)]
*  Can I respond to that? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3742.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, in one second. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3743.2999999999997s)]
*  Okay, look, you're giving them way too much credit, J. Cal. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3744.58s)]
*  I'm not giving them any credit. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3747.22s)]
*  I do not want to see this happen. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3748.74s)]
*  I'm not giving them any credit. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3750.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm just saying we'll see how heavy-handed they'll be. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3751.38s)]
*  You're assuming they're going to be super heavy-handed. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3754.2599999999998s)]
*  We'll see. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3756.5s)]
*  And we'll see what their own citizens respond. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3756.98s)]
*  I think the fact that a room full of commissioners in the U can send takedown requests [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3759.54s)]
*  to social media companies is by definition heavy-handed. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3764.2599999999998s)]
*  Let me back up. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3767.94s)]
*  What the Twitter file showed is that we had 80 FBI agents being the conduit for takedown requests [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3769.14s)]
*  to Twitter and presumably other social networks. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3776.02s)]
*  No, no, but that was all on the DL. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3778.34s)]
*  On the DL, exactly. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3780.02s)]
*  Yes, that was not long. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3781.06s)]
*  And yes, moreover, when they did that in their takedown requests, they would always point to, [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3782.02s)]
*  well, this tweet violates your terms of service. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3787.54s)]
*  What the EU is doing is different. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3792.5s)]
*  They're actually defining the terms of service. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3794.1s)]
*  They're saying that your terms of service need to do X, Y, and Z. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3795.94s)]
*  They're doing it explicitly. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3799.7799999999997s)]
*  This is not on the DL. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3801.06s)]
*  They're explicitly saying that your moderation policy needs to be what we say it is. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3802.18s)]
*  And when we tell you to take something down, you're going to do it. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3807.06s)]
*  They haven't defined what that is. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3810.1s)]
*  That's, I think, the issue is where is the actual definition of what's going to happen here? [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3811.7s)]
*  That's why it's hard for us to have a discussion about this is because we don't know what they're [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3815.94s)]
*  talking about with this content. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3819.2200000000003s)]
*  That's so problematic. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3821.06s)]
*  Whatever they say in the future is disinformation needs to be taken down. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3822.42s)]
*  That's the framework. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3826.18s)]
*  The fine is going to be up to 6% of global revenue for companies that do not comply. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3827.46s)]
*  So the EU has also figured out that speeding tickets don't work and they're looking to [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3833.46s)]
*  give pretty heavy penalties. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3839.46s)]
*  So we'll see. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3840.9s)]
*  This is a moving target here. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3843.7000000000003s)]
*  We don't have complete information, but yeah, it's not a moving target. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3846.6600000000003s)]
*  We do have complete information. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3850.58s)]
*  This is a censorship regime, Jason. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3852.1800000000003s)]
*  We just don't know what their term for illegal or problematic content is here. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3854.1800000000003s)]
*  I don't want to be pitted as your adversary here. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3860.98s)]
*  I am not in favor of this. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3863.2200000000003s)]
*  So we're clear. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3864.9s)]
*  But I don't think there should be a star chamber where people get to pick what goes up and what [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3866.58s)]
*  goes down there. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3870.5s)]
*  I think the private companies can do a good enough job there and there should be freedom [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3871.3s)]
*  of speech. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3874.82s)]
*  And yeah, you're going to see some things you don't like. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3875.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3877.3s)]
*  Grow up. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3877.62s)]
*  Change the time. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3878.02s)]
*  I mean, they feel like it basically, as they say, sets a horizontal rule covering all services [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3878.9s)]
*  and all types of illegal content and disinformation. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3886.02s)]
*  Illegal content could be fine, right? [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3890.18s)]
*  Freeburg, like illegal content, putting up doxing somebody, child pornography, illegal [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3891.54s)]
*  content. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3896.74s)]
*  I think we would all be okay with it's the disinformation part, right? [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3897.14s)]
*  I'm not trying to be okay or not. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3899.94s)]
*  Okay. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3901.14s)]
*  I'm just saying that like you're basically saying that whatever the rules are that they [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3901.38s)]
*  come up with that may be different than somewhere else on the Internet, they get to then regulate [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3904.82s)]
*  other businesses on the Internet. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3909.3s)]
*  I think the Internet should be open. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3911.46s)]
*  Well, and there are a lot. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3913.38s)]
*  I don't want to have a commission approve what I write in my blog post. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3914.58s)]
*  I don't want the commission telling me that what I put on Twitter or put on my website [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3918.1s)]
*  is up to them to decide whether or not it's okay to put up because they think it's illegal [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3922.66s)]
*  because it has what they deem to be misinformation. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3927.06s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3931.06s)]
*  There are already laws that exist. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3931.2999999999997s)]
*  So disinformation, illegal content, two different things. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3932.9s)]
*  But those laws provide some authority to a commissioner. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3935.46s)]
*  I mean, that's the problem, right? [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3938.58s)]
*  It's right. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3939.7799999999997s)]
*  Look, the problem is in the vagueness of this. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3940.66s)]
*  The law says that social media companies have to take down illegal content, but it [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3943.62s)]
*  doesn't say what illegal content is. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3947.7s)]
*  It delegates the power to define it to this group of Eurocrats led by Theory Breton. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3949.06s)]
*  And they're meeting this week to hammer it out. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3955.3s)]
*  So yeah, look, in practice, illegal content is going to be whatever they say it is. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3957.86s)]
*  That is explicit censorship. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3962.1800000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3964.26s)]
*  Let's move on to our final topic. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3965.3s)]
*  Second largest hype cycle of 2023, perhaps GLP ones. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3968.1000000000004s)]
*  Chamath, you brought this up in our group chat. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3973.38s)]
*  So maybe you could tee it up. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3976.02s)]
*  Well, I was just interested in understanding everything that's been happening around GLP's. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3977.3s)]
*  Mostly because it just seems like people think it's a panacea. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3985.38s)]
*  We have a lot of our friends. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3990.42s)]
*  Jason, you were the one that said this in our poker group, like four of the 12 or 13 regulars [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3991.7000000000003s)]
*  are on it. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3998.9s)]
*  Is that right? [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=3999.38s)]
*  I think it was four of like, yeah, four of 12 people are on it. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4000.42s)]
*  Yeah, it was a third. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4003.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4004.82s)]
*  And then I got this really interesting chart, Nick. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4005.6200000000003s)]
*  You may want to put this up. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4008.5800000000004s)]
*  It basically showed how the GLP one market was tracking very similar to the AI market [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4009.78s)]
*  in terms of the hype, which is if you separated companies as a basket of people who were [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4020.6600000000003s)]
*  positively affected by GLP ones, like Lily and Novo Nordisk, and you had a basket of [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4027.6200000000003s)]
*  companies that were disrupted by GLP ones, those would be like Dexcom or DaVita or folks [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4034.1s)]
*  like that. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4041.38s)]
*  It eerily mimics the same hype cycle around AI, which is there's those businesses that [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4041.94s)]
*  seem to be feeding the hype train around AI and then all of these companies that [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4047.38s)]
*  theoretically will be disrupted. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4051.54s)]
*  And it just brought up to me that there's this incredible market movement here where [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4052.9s)]
*  I think people think that these GLP ones are a solution to everything. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4058.42s)]
*  And I thought it was just an important thing to discuss because scientifically, the mechanism [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4063.54s)]
*  of action is still a little questionable and murky. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4067.94s)]
*  On top of that, I think we don't know physiologically what the real long-term ramifications of [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4070.74s)]
*  taking these things are. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4074.74s)]
*  There's still a lot of mixed evidence around the total amount of weight loss you can lose, [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4076.74s)]
*  the percentage of muscle versus fat that you lose. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4081.46s)]
*  And so, yeah, I just thought it was important for us to talk about it and see what this would [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4084.18s)]
*  be a basket spread trade. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4087.54s)]
*  Here are the companies that win. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4090.82s)]
*  Here are the companies that loses. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4092.5s)]
*  And look at that gap between the two. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4093.62s)]
*  And it's exactly mimics people who would benefit from AI and people would lose from AI. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4095.06s)]
*  Yeah, the GLP one hype. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4100.18s)]
*  The summary is the GLP one hype cycle is as overextended as the AI hype cycle. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4102.18s)]
*  So we should probably separate the wheat from the chaff and start by understanding what [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4110.34s)]
*  GLP ones are because I'm sure there's a lot of people in our listening community who are [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4114.42s)]
*  on this stuff. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4118.98s)]
*  They should really probably understand. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4119.78s)]
*  If that's where you think we should go next, we should then throw it to the [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4121.22s)]
*  Sultan of science himself. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4126.9800000000005s)]
*  David Freberg explained to us while we prepare our Uranus jokes, GLP ones. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4128.26s)]
*  These drugs have been around for a while. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4136.34s)]
*  They're small peptides, little proteins that bind to this GLP receptor in your gut that [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4138.820000000001s)]
*  causes insulin to be released from your pancreas and triggers a couple of other hormones that [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4146.42s)]
*  reduce your hunger and appetite. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4153.9400000000005s)]
*  So basically gets you to eat less and your brain and your brain. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4155.3s)]
*  And it's effectively a way to make you feel not hungry. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4159.62s)]
*  And you can then run a calorie deficit. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4162.5s)]
*  And when you run a calorie deficit, your body starts starving and starts burning other parts [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4165.14s)]
*  of your body besides the glucose it can get out of the stomach where you would otherwise [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4171.62s)]
*  have food and ends up in your blood. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4175.86s)]
*  And it starts generating energy from your stored body fat and your stored and your muscle [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4178.259999999999s)]
*  mass. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4183.38s)]
*  So these have been around for a while. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4183.7s)]
*  Novo Nordisk is the developer of two of the main drugs. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4185.38s)]
*  And here's a chart of Novo Nordisk stock price. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4192.5s)]
*  You can see that in the last five years, their stock has five X. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4195.62s)]
*  They've basically gone from, you know, call it a $60 billion company to a $350 billion [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4200.179999999999s)]
*  company in five years, largely on the back of the promise of this drug. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4205.86s)]
*  So these drugs have been around for a while. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4210.74s)]
*  And there's actually one that's been on the market for a long time, but it only causes [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4212.34s)]
*  5% body mass loss. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4215.38s)]
*  So 5% weight loss. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4217.14s)]
*  So people are like, oh, it's not that great. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4218.42s)]
*  It didn't really get widely adopted. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4219.7s)]
*  Then this new class, they added a little side chain, added another little molecule to the [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4221.22s)]
*  peptide. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4225.22s)]
*  And as a result, it didn't get degraded as fast and it was far more bioactive in the [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4226.26s)]
*  body and caused a much greater benefit. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4229.94s)]
*  And so suddenly people on these drugs started to see massive weight loss, massive improvement, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4232.26s)]
*  diabetes and metabolic health all moves together. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4236.02s)]
*  So as you burn body fat, as you have less glucose in your blood, your metabolic condition [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4238.58s)]
*  improves. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4243.38s)]
*  The problem is when you're starving normally, if you were to just stop eating, you would [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4244.26s)]
*  typically see that your body starts burning. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4249.3s)]
*  First of all, the glucose and then it burns off the glycogen in your muscles, which is [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4251.780000000001s)]
*  the next energy store. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4254.9800000000005s)]
*  Once that's gone, your body starts burning fat. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4256.5s)]
*  And as it's burning more fat, it also says, hey, I need to get these other molecules, [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4259.22s)]
*  which I'm not getting just from the fat. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4263.7s)]
*  I need muscle. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4265.14s)]
*  And your body actually starts burning muscle. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4266.26s)]
*  And that's how your brain gets energy that it needs when you're starving is actually [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4268.42s)]
*  primarily from the degradation of muscle tissue. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4271.78s)]
*  So normally, if you're just starving yourself, you'll see a ratio of weight loss where it's [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4276.18s)]
*  about 20% coming from lean muscle mass. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4281.62s)]
*  In some of the studies that have been done on these GLP-1 agonists, we're seeing up to [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4284.0199999999995s)]
*  40% of the weight loss coming from lean muscle mass being burnt off. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4288.419999999999s)]
*  So Jason, I don't know if you've done a DEXA scan because I think you've said publicly [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4294.179999999999s)]
*  that you've tried it, right? [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4297.94s)]
*  I mean, you should check out what your lean muscle mass is versus your fat composition [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4298.66s)]
*  in your body. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4304.58s)]
*  I don't know if you have it from before, but this has been one of the concerns. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4305.379999999999s)]
*  Obviously, if you're not working out and you're not doing what you need to to eat protein [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4310.66s)]
*  and build muscle, you're going to be burning through a lot of that muscle mass. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4316.0199999999995s)]
*  And so that's problem number one that's arisen that people are concerned about. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4319.38s)]
*  The other one that's really, I don't know if it's concerning or not, but when people [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4322.98s)]
*  go off these drugs, they gain the weight back in a very quick way. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4326.98s)]
*  And there's two reasons for this. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4332.18s)]
*  One is if you haven't actually changed your behavior, you haven't changed your exercise [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4333.38s)]
*  patterns, and you suddenly have the appetite suppressing drug taken out of your system, [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4336.98s)]
*  you start eating more food again. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4342.259999999999s)]
*  And when you've been in a state of starvation, your metabolism, your baseline metabolism [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4344.419999999999s)]
*  goes down. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4350.58s)]
*  So instead of burning on average 2000 calories a day, your body's only burning at 1200 [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4351.379999999999s)]
*  calories a day. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4355.299999999999s)]
*  So suddenly, if you go back to eating 2000 calories a day, because you no longer have [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4356.259999999999s)]
*  the appetite suppressor, you're going to re-inflate. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4360.82s)]
*  And so your metabolism goes down, the appetite suppressant goes away, and you gain all the [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4365.14s)]
*  weight back if you haven't changed your behavior otherwise. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4369.22s)]
*  And so I don't know if you guys saw this clip I sent out of Arnold Schwarzenegger talking [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4372.5s)]
*  with Howard Stern, but he was talking about how like, I can't do a Howard accent, J. Cal, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4375.860000000001s)]
*  you could probably do it really well. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4380.42s)]
*  But you know, one thing or you're what do you think of the OZAMPIC? [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4381.38s)]
*  For you know how the OZAMPIC is, you know, Americans used to be very interested in working [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4385.860000000001s)]
*  hard and I don't know why that's so bad, but you get up at 5am and you work hard and you [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4391.38s)]
*  do it and you make yourself strong. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4395.86s)]
*  That's what it's about. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4398.26s)]
*  You don't need to do a little baby girl OZAMPIC in your side. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4399.14s)]
*  Oh, look, I'm going to eat less food. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4401.86s)]
*  Wait, did you listen to the clip? [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4406.42s)]
*  Is that what he said? [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4407.62s)]
*  That's exactly what he said. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4408.5s)]
*  That's exactly what he said. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4411.22s)]
*  You told me a really bad man. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4412.5s)]
*  I don't make it this way. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4414.18s)]
*  OZAMPIC. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4415.22s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4416.02s)]
*  This was epic. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4416.66s)]
*  Hard work. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4419.22s)]
*  Hard work. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4420.66s)]
*  That's why I say in my book, you know, work your ass off. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4420.98s)]
*  And there's no shortcut. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4425.38s)]
*  What built this country? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4428.099999999999s)]
*  God, you think I got two months? [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4429.139999999999s)]
*  Is it people that were wimping out? [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4432.099999999999s)]
*  No, America's great. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4434.74s)]
*  No, this was ballsy women and men that went out there at 5 in the morning and got up and [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4437.46s)]
*  they struggled and they fought and they worked their butts off. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4442.98s)]
*  That's what made this country great. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4447.54s)]
*  So great. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4449.94s)]
*  He said that in response to, I think, Howard Stern's questions about OZAMPIC. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4451.139999999999s)]
*  We're basically creating a new multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical drug [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4456.58s)]
*  system that people are going to have to stay on in order to stay healthy. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4462.259999999999s)]
*  Do we know what the long-term effects of taking semaglutide are and can be and will be? [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4465.86s)]
*  These drugs have been around for quite a long time. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4472.42s)]
*  So, you know, there are various side effects, but in terms of like, are we debilitating our [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4474.58s)]
*  health over the long run? [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4480.5s)]
*  It seems to be a reasonably safe drug and it seems to be a drug that folks are [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4483.46s)]
*  kind of recognizing as being well worth the cost and whatever the risks may be. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4488.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, what are the implications for the benefit? [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4492.82s)]
*  If you lose 40%? [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4494.5s)]
*  Well, it's about 16% of your weight loss you typically lose, right? [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4496.5s)]
*  I mean, yeah, they'll say up to 20%. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4500.58s)]
*  If you lose weight, you'll usually see up to 20% of lean muscle mass of the weight you lost [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4503.06s)]
*  coming from lean muscle mass loss. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4508.26s)]
*  And, you know, 80% or 85%, as you say, Chamath, coming from body fat loss. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4511.06s)]
*  But with the OZAMPIC drugs, they're seeing as high as 40% coming from lean muscle mass, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4515.780000000001s)]
*  which is obviously concerning. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4519.780000000001s)]
*  I just made an adjustment. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4521.06s)]
*  Everybody knows I lost like 40 pounds or so or talk to me for more than five minutes, you know I have. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4522.26s)]
*  Because I'll tell you. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4528.02s)]
*  And the first 20 was just fasting and doing keto. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4528.820000000001s)]
*  And then when this drug came out, I tried it. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4531.78s)]
*  I tried it with OZAMPIC and then I did Wigovia and I lost the next 20 pounds. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4533.7s)]
*  I'm going to give you some math. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4536.5s)]
*  I didn't gain it back. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4537.3s)]
*  I gained back about four or five pounds. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4538.9s)]
*  And I also increased protein in the morning. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4540.66s)]
*  And I do a lot of walking. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4543.0599999999995s)]
*  Okay, so let me give you this math and tell me if it maps to what you have felt or not. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4544.259999999999s)]
*  So if 250 pounds, let's just say you lose 16% of your body weight, that's 40 pounds. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4548.42s)]
*  Okay, so you get to 190. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4554.82s)]
*  I'm sorry, 210. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4556.9s)]
*  And of that, you lose 16 pounds of muscle. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4558.820000000001s)]
*  Is that what you saw or did you see something less than that? [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4562.34s)]
*  No, much less muscle because I use weights and I do a lot of walking and I eat a ton of protein. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4565.06s)]
*  Right, so you're doing the exercise. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4570.5s)]
*  I'm not doing hardcore exercise. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4573.14s)]
*  You have to do exercise. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4576.58s)]
*  And the challenge, J Cal, is that the vast majority of people that go on the drugs, by the way, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4577.700000000001s)]
*  I'm not saying the drugs shouldn't be adopted. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4581.62s)]
*  I think that there's extraordinary benefit, health benefit, [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4583.780000000001s)]
*  to the majority of people that are on these drugs. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4586.580000000001s)]
*  But the downside is that if you're not exercising, you are going to lose muscle mass. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4588.5s)]
*  And then obviously there is the fact that you're now hooked on this thing. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4593.14s)]
*  If you're not going to figure out ways to change behavior. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4595.860000000001s)]
*  I cycled off of it two or three times and had very minor weight gain back three, four, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4598.42s)]
*  five pounds. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4604.34s)]
*  But I deliberately changed my relationship with food, portion size, and I work out now. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4604.820000000001s)]
*  And what I found was as I lost weight, my interest and the joy I got out of working [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4610.18s)]
*  out dramatically increased. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4615.62s)]
*  So running, walking, skiing, everything got easier and I just got more into it. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4617.54s)]
*  So I like working out again now that I'm 40 pounds, 42 pounds off my peak weight. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4622.74s)]
*  So I think it's an amazing wonder drug. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4629.78s)]
*  But you have a summary point on this, like a take on this. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4632.0199999999995s)]
*  You think that these things are overhyped right now and we're just in the middle of [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4634.82s)]
*  a hype cycle or what's your key takeaway? [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4637.22s)]
*  My key takeaway is that for many people from a health perspective, I think that [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4639.0599999999995s)]
*  it could be a really great solution. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4643.299999999999s)]
*  I think that these triple agonists that are coming out are going to be probably even more [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4648.66s)]
*  effective than these double agonists that we have right now. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4652.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4655.299999999999s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4657.54s)]
*  Is that the triple? [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4658.58s)]
*  Munjaro is the triple agonist, yeah. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4659.78s)]
*  People who take Munjaro told me it is unbelievable how not hungry you are. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4661.86s)]
*  Yeah, it's super fast too. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4668.5s)]
*  Super fast. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4670.179999999999s)]
*  I just want to see, for example, when you get older in your 60s and 70s, one of the [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4670.98s)]
*  biggest risks you take on in your 80s is actually musculoskeletal and falls and things like that. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4677.94s)]
*  And one of the best preventative measures for that is muscle mass. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4684.0199999999995s)]
*  And so you get into this weird catch-22 of you replace one issue with another. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4686.5s)]
*  So longitudinally, if you use it for a long time, I'm concerned about that. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4690.98s)]
*  I do think that these GLP-1s, when we look back on it, will probably be like statins. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4694.66s)]
*  And inasmuch as when statins first came on the market, it was a wonder drug, right? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4700.18s)]
*  And we were all teetering towards heart disease and heart attacks and all of this stuff. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4706.900000000001s)]
*  And then once people got on these statins, I think there was a very meaningful impact [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4712.18s)]
*  to the percentage of people that suffered heart disease and cardiac issues. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4715.7s)]
*  But heart disease still continues to grow. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4719.46s)]
*  And you would say to yourself, well, how is this possible? [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4722.02s)]
*  Because statins are effectively free. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4724.1s)]
*  They're generic. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4725.7s)]
*  They're widely available. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4726.34s)]
*  And today, right now, because of the lack of supply, the emergency FDA order around [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4727.38s)]
*  these semi-glutides allows you to make generics right now. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4733.86s)]
*  Right? [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4736.74s)]
*  So the cost of those are not really a thousand bucks a month, but can be as cheap as a few hundred. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4737.3s)]
*  So you're getting this widespread adoption and usage. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4742.82s)]
*  I think the open question for me is, if human history is a guide, we're going to replace [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4745.3s)]
*  this issue with a different kind of issue. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4751.86s)]
*  Because unfortunately, you know, maybe people take it and then they physiologically adapt, [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4754.34s)]
*  and then they just continue to eat the same or more because they think, wow, [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4760.9800000000005s)]
*  this is a get out of jail free card for me. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4764.02s)]
*  And maybe they overpower that satiety that that GLP-1 is supposed to give you. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4766.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4771.46s)]
*  I find it from a sort of public societal health perspective, really interesting. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4772.74s)]
*  From an economic market perspective, I think that these things are priced to perfection. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4778.58s)]
*  It's kind of like Nvidia, which is like, right. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4784.66s)]
*  Everything's got to go right. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4787.78s)]
*  Everything. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4789.38s)]
*  People are assuming everything is going to work. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4790.18s)]
*  It's a tough point in the cycle to be a buyer, I think, as an economic actor. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4792.26s)]
*  But if you're making a trade that seems like a hard trade to make, and just to give even some more [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4796.26s)]
*  color to it, Novo Nordisk announced that it was halting its ozempokinion disease trial early. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4802.74s)]
*  Because it was so conclusive. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4808.9800000000005s)]
*  That sparked a $3.6 billion sell off in shares of dialysis providers. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4812.18s)]
*  Remember, over 40% of Americans are clinically obese. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4818.34s)]
*  It's almost 60% now. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4821.62s)]
*  It's an extraordinary health epidemic in the United States. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4823.38s)]
*  And if this drug can have this sort of an effect, it can reduce costs across the health care system. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4825.860000000001s)]
*  So there is still a... [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4830.82s)]
*  I mean, Chamath's point, I don't know the right number. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4832.34s)]
*  This affects cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4835.3s)]
*  Does an average 16% weight loss reduction actually get people from obesity to [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4843.38s)]
*  unobesity? [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4848.9800000000005s)]
*  Or are they still obese? [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4849.780000000001s)]
*  The obesity trial seemed to... [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4852.26s)]
*  I mean, remember, you have to get FDA approval for a particular... [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4853.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so this is what Jason was mentioning. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4856.66s)]
*  So this is a basket that Morgan Stanley created, which was essentially [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4858.58s)]
*  starting at the beginning of the year when the hype was really starting to get out of control. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4864.74s)]
*  Morgan Stanley created a basket of the GLP-1 winners and a basket of the [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4869.7s)]
*  GLP-1 potentially disrupted health care stocks so you could trade them off against each other. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4873.780000000001s)]
*  And this just shows how it's performed, which is just a blockbuster trade in the last 10 months. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4878.26s)]
*  So if you went long the GLP-1 winners and short these potentially disrupted, [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4883.780000000001s)]
*  I've never seen a spread trade payoff like this in such a short period of time. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4890.66s)]
*  80% a year, unless... [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4893.7s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4894.98s)]
*  Does the nature of creating... [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4895.62s)]
*  But Jamal, would you take the other side of this trade right now? [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4897.62s)]
*  Or how do you... [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4899.78s)]
*  I would. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4900.66s)]
*  I would take the other side. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4901.46s)]
*  And the reason is because of two practical factors. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4902.9s)]
*  One is that when a market gets this exaggerated, what you're pricing in is essentially like a [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4906.26s)]
*  panacea solution. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4914.18s)]
*  And those tend to not really be realistic. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4915.22s)]
*  And again, I would point to statins as a good example of that. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4917.78s)]
*  And so there's a part of it which is just like these trades are so overextended that you can [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4920.42s)]
*  probably be pretty safe on the other side. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4926.42s)]
*  And then the second part is that I don't think we really understand yet the other half of the [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4928.66s)]
*  coin, which is for every one of us that's generally positively inclined around GLP-1s, [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4934.5s)]
*  who isn't getting enough attention right now, are the doctors who are spending a lot of time [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4941.86s)]
*  researching this stuff, who may actually have a perspective on the other side, probably the most [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4947.06s)]
*  prominent one like Bob Lustig. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4952.42s)]
*  So you have to give that a little bit of time for it to play out because nobody wants to hear the [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4954.42s)]
*  bare case on GLP-1s as a drug that people take. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4960.1s)]
*  So I would just say that it's probably, again, when you see an economic trade like this, it's [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4965.14s)]
*  it's probably okay to be on the other side of it. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4970.58s)]
*  And then just from a public health perspective, you know, take a wait and see. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4973.46s)]
*  But for a lot of people who are clinically obese, it doesn't seem like the math is such that [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4978.5s)]
*  if you're at a BMI of 30, reducing your weight 16%, I think gets you to like a 26. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4983.78s)]
*  It doesn't get you under the- [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4989.14s)]
*  I think it's meaningful. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4990.26s)]
*  I think it's meaningful. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4991.14s)]
*  No, no, I'm not saying it's not meaningful. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4991.94s)]
*  I'm saying it does it. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4993.14s)]
*  You're still obese. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4994.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think the key thing, and I don't want to give medical advice, but [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4996.02s)]
*  I think you need to do this holistically. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5000.18s)]
*  So you got to keep your diet and you got to keep working out in mind when you do it. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5002.26s)]
*  And that should be fairly obvious. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5005.3s)]
*  And those are always good things to do is to make sure you- [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5006.900000000001s)]
*  Do you plan to take it your whole life in sports, J Cal? [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5008.34s)]
*  No. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5010.9800000000005s)]
*  Or how do you view it? [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5011.4800000000005s)]
*  No, I'm five pounds from my lowest weight as an adult and the weight I used to be when I ran [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5012.26s)]
*  marathons. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5016.34s)]
*  And so my plan is to come off of it, like by the end of this year. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5017.06s)]
*  And then, and I had taken like six months off twice doing this. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5021.3s)]
*  So I did it like in little intentional- [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5025.62s)]
*  In sports. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5027.9400000000005s)]
*  In sports. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5028.58s)]
*  In sports, yeah. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5029.62s)]
*  Just to get where I want it to be. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5030.26s)]
*  And this last five pounds- [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5032.58s)]
*  What is your- [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5036.66s)]
*  Do you have a sense of if your behavior changes when you're on and you're off? [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5037.7s)]
*  Like, do you- [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5044.42s)]
*  Yeah, I do feel more hungry, but then I remember how bad I felt when I was overweight. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5045.78s)]
*  And I just weigh myself every day. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5053.46s)]
*  And if I see myself get above a certain number, I consider that like a red alert. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5055.3s)]
*  And I just, you know, either start fasting, working out, or just eating super healthy. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5059.46s)]
*  So it's just the discipline of weighing myself every day that I've gotten into. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5063.94s)]
*  And just understanding, hey, you know, if I make two or three bad decisions, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5069.0599999999995s)]
*  you're not going to make two or three bad decisions when you're on these drugs in my [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5073.299999999999s)]
*  experience because you feel so bloated and so painful when you overeat that you don't [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5075.78s)]
*  want to do it. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5079.78s)]
*  So it's really, it's really like, it hurts. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5080.34s)]
*  You feel distended. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5082.5s)]
*  And, you know, there are reports and it did happen to me twice over two or three years [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5083.62s)]
*  of doing this, that if you take it and you eat too much, you could get sick and actually [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5087.94s)]
*  vomit. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5091.62s)]
*  So some people just don't have the stomach for it. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5092.0199999999995s)]
*  I think a lot of people just tap out. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5095.54s)]
*  It makes their stomachs feel too distended or gnarly. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5097.0599999999995s)]
*  And that's why the dosage actually really matters. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5101.46s)]
*  They have dosages that are like a very wide range, maybe 10X. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5103.62s)]
*  And so the dosage, getting that right, working with your doctor is key. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5108.5s)]
*  But yeah, I'm just, I'm excited to get off of it because I want to really start [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5112.66s)]
*  sincerely weightlifting. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5115.22s)]
*  So I'm getting a personal trainer to do like weightlifting twice a week and get really [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5116.34s)]
*  into that next because you can't do hardcore intense working out with this because you're, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5120.900000000001s)]
*  you know, just lower calorie. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5126.1s)]
*  But I think it's a miracle drug and I'm excited about it. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5128.5s)]
*  The one question I have for you on the Sprite trade before we end, Chamath, [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5131.62s)]
*  does the nature of making those indexes and giving people the ability to put the trade on [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5134.9800000000005s)]
*  exacerbate the trade? [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5139.9400000000005s)]
*  Because then I saw everybody was tweeting about this, you know, over the last week, [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5141.14s)]
*  does the nature of an index being made impact the action in the stocks? [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5144.9s)]
*  It depends. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5150.82s)]
*  You know, Morgan Stanley is particularly good at these basket creations and they [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5151.299999999999s)]
*  tend to make it for their biggest hedge fund clients and their richest families. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5155.219999999999s)]
*  So it tends to be pretty isolated. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5158.74s)]
*  They give an edge to a few folks. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5160.82s)]
*  So these things are not broadly published. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5164.42s)]
*  And so I doubt it in the end. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5168.179999999999s)]
*  But so they come up with this idea. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5169.78s)]
*  How many names are in each index? [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5171.54s)]
*  It all just depends. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=5173.7s)]
