# DeepSeek Panic, US vs China, OpenAI $40B?, and Doge Delivers with Travis Kalanick and David Sacks
**All In Podcast:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s)
*  All right, everybody. Welcome back to the all in podcast. We've got an incredible crew today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=0.0s)]
*  Don't forget to go to our YouTube, blah, blah, blah, subscribe. And make sure you check out [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5.28s)]
*  Freberg's surprise drop with his hero, Ray Dalio live on all platforms today. How did that come [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=10.88s)]
*  about? Freberg, a little surprise drop. Just great. Was talking with Ray about his new book, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=17.76s)]
*  which he just published on how countries go broke. Obviously, which country is going [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=24.32s)]
*  broke now? America. I think he talks a lot about the historical context of what's gone on with the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=29.2s)]
*  debt cycles in different countries. And basically, at the end of the book, he has a pretty, I think, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=36.24s)]
*  important recommendation to try and get the US to roughly 3% of GDP as our net deficit, net of all [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=43.68s)]
*  expense, including interest expense. So that's the recommendation to the administration. I think it's [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=52.64s)]
*  pretty timely with the change in administration. Anyway, great topics to talk through and really [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=56.72s)]
*  important book. Awesome. Well done. And we are super delighted to have in the red throne, Travis [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=62.4s)]
*  Cowan. He is the co-founder and CEO of cloud kitchens. He also worked in the cab business for [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=70.32s)]
*  a little bit, co-founder and former CEO of Uber. And yeah, we had a great interview at the all in [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=76.24s)]
*  summit last year and he's back up from his media hiatus. He's been in the lab working on cloud [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=82.08s)]
*  kitchens. How you doing, brother? I'm doing really well. I got to say just like at the summit, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=87.12s)]
*  Jason, it's an honor to be in the presence of such a prominent investor. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=91.92s)]
*  Absolutely. I mean, finally somebody has recognized the greatness of J. Cal. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=98.88s)]
*  I'll mention it three or four times. I'll give you the props. You don't have to do it for [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=108.08s)]
*  yourself anymore. Thank you. I appreciate it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=111.68s)]
*  Give everybody a little overview of cloud kitchens and the business and how it's going because people [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=130.88s)]
*  are obviously addicted to ordering food at home and it's quite a trend. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=136.96s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, the high level for it, the way to think about it is it's about the future of food. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=143.28s)]
*  What does the future of food look like? You go, well, in a hundred years, we'll start way out [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=148.32s)]
*  there. In a hundred years, you're going to have very high quality food, very low cost [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=152.96s)]
*  that's incredibly convenient. And there are going to be machines that make it. There are going to be [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=160.56s)]
*  machines that get it to you and it's going to be exactly to your dietary preferences, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=164.32s)]
*  your food preferences, et cetera. And it just comes to you and it's so inexpensive [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  that it approaches or has surpassed the cost of going to the grocery store. That's more of a today [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=174.32s)]
*  analogy. So you go, a hundred years, of course, that's the thing. Nobody's going to be making [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=179.44s)]
*  food. What about 20? What about 10? And so the company is real estate, software, and robotics. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=185.2s)]
*  That's all about the future of food. And if you can get the quality there and you can get that cost [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  down to start approaching the cost of going to the grocery store, you do to the kitchen what Uber did [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=201.2s)]
*  to the car. And that's the thing. And it's like a grind. It's like bits and atoms in the Uber world. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  This is like five times more atoms per bit. This is like heavy duty industrial stuff, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  probably more along the lines of like, you know, where Elon goes and some of his companies, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  like they're super interesting tech, but you've got to grind out those atoms. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=228.48s)]
*  Do you see people actually cooking in the future or does it become a centralized service? And is [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=232.16s)]
*  it optimized to people's health? And what do you think the implications to the food supply are? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=237.28s)]
*  If your vision holds, how do you think about all those things? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=241.83999999999997s)]
*  Look, people will cook in the future as a hobby. I sort of, I make a joke at the office. I'm like, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  I like horses. I love horses, but I don't ride a horse to work. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=251.84s)]
*  And it's going to be a little bit like that. Whereas you can cook. It's a soulful thing to do. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=255.6s)]
*  It's just very human. But you know, it's late, you know, mom gets home late from the office, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=261.44s)]
*  needs to get the kids, you know, a nutritious meal. She doesn't have to cook it now. And she [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=268.96s)]
*  won't have to cook it and she won't have to go to McDonald's either. It will be high quality [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=274.88s)]
*  and convenient and low cost all at the same time. And yes, dietary preference, everything, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=281.28s)]
*  because it will be hyper personalized. Like the way the internet is in content, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=286.24s)]
*  plus, plus, plus in terms of your specific preferences for what you want. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=291.52s)]
*  I mean, you've got these computers rocking, these robots rocking, I think in Philly somewhere in the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=297.84s)]
*  lab where they're making bowls. Yeah. I mean, we're out of the lab at this point. We have [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=303.28s)]
*  our machines. So we have a machine called a bowl builder that basically makes different cuisine [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=308.64s)]
*  types with bowls. So like, think of like, like sweet greens, like what they, yeah, we're not [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=313.67999999999995s)]
*  working with these brands specifically, but I'll just sort of, it's a good analogy. Like [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=318.23999999999995s)]
*  think of Chipotle or Cava or sweet green, or you get the idea. We created test brands that were [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=323.2s)]
*  like those things and built the machine at the same time as we were building an actual restaurant. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=331.44s)]
*  And we built that restaurant to prove that the machine works. Then we have our customers now [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=338.64s)]
*  touring, checking out, we're rolling out with five customers in April. They're using the machine [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=347.52s)]
*  and the way it will, the way it's going to go down is they will come into, and we, of course, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=352.88s)]
*  we have the real estate, so we have kitchens, you know, tens of thousands of kitchens around the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=358.88s)]
*  world. They will come into one of our kitchens in a facility. It's a delivery only restaurant. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=362.24s)]
*  They'll prep the food in the morning and then they will leave. And the machine will, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=368.24s)]
*  people order online door dash uber eats, et cetera. They'll order online the way they do, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=373.28s)]
*  build your own bowl exactly as you want. And the bowl gets all the ingredients dispensed, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=378.64s)]
*  hot or cold, sauce, et cetera, gets lidded. The bowl goes into a bag, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=386.48s)]
*  the utensils go into the bag, the bag is sealed, and then it comes out on a conveyor belt. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=393.52s)]
*  And machine gets the bag, it goes to the front of the facility, gets put into a locker. That locker [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=398.48s)]
*  then is sitting there, door dash uber eats driver comes, waves their phone with an app in front of [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=405.52s)]
*  a camera and it pops open the locker that has the food that you're supposed to get. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  So cool. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=414.08000000000004s)]
*  So like if you're a restaurateur, the grind of the on-demand meal, which is the restaurant world, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=415.2s)]
*  goes away. You basically prep and that's asynchronous from when people order food. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=422.8s)]
*  The machine does the final assembly or what's known as plating, essentially. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=428.56s)]
*  Do you think there's a service in the future where my physiology, I can share that with you, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=434.40000000000003s)]
*  with cloud kitchens and you guys just can always be optimizing my food based on what I know is good [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=441.12s)]
*  or bad for me? So first, what we do is we serve the restaurants. So what happened, so Chamath, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  you'll be sharing your dietary preferences with uber eats or door dash or sweet green or somebody. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=456.56s)]
*  We, like our customer promise at our companies, we serve those who serve others. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=464.56s)]
*  Or put another way, infrastructure for better food. So we are either the AWS or the Nvidia [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=470.47999999999996s)]
*  or whatever you want to call it, but for food. If that makes sense, we're behind the scenes, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=477.44s)]
*  we're the infrastructure. And so you'll give your preferences. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=481.28s)]
*  Right. It should be a brand like then Sweet Greens or whomever, Chipotle that says, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=484.47999999999996s)]
*  hey guys, share with me an encrypted hash of your dietary restrictions, needs, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=488.15999999999997s)]
*  whatever, your lipid panel and I'll customize this thing and then you enable that. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=495.68s)]
*  On the back. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=499.76s)]
*  That's pretty close Chamath, right? You can do that, authenticate your Apple Health. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=500.4s)]
*  That's really awesome. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=503.68s)]
*  You can just authenticate Apple Health. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=504.32s)]
*  When these bowls come off the line, and see how I talk, it's like an assembly line. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=505.44s)]
*  When these bowls come off the line, on the label on the bowl is how many grams of every ingredient [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=509.2s)]
*  is in it. Plus a picture of what it was before we put the lid in, that can be sent to the person [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=516.24s)]
*  while the bowl's on its way via courier. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=522.56s)]
*  What do you think Travis about this whole Maha movement and just the food supply itself? So then [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=525.28s)]
*  how does that change? Do restaurants embrace more farm to table stuff? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=530.0s)]
*  I think, look, I think what we see with supply chains in a bunch of different industries, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=534.3199999999999s)]
*  it's just going to get super wired up. So right now we're at the point of manufacturing, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=538.88s)]
*  but what happens, so you go, okay, we're doing assembly. Then you go, okay, what about prep? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=544.4799999999999s)]
*  Then you go further upstream and you're like, what about supply chain like Cisco, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=549.04s)]
*  US Foods? Then you go further up and you're like, well, how does the mechanization occur [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=552.48s)]
*  on farms and in agriculture? Then how does that all get wired up to serve the customer [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  and what they're looking for? So you really can know exactly what kind of wheat was put into [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=563.8399999999999s)]
*  that food, whether it was organic for real or not, what was the actual field that came from, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=571.36s)]
*  things like this. You can imagine really getting tied about supply chain as it relates to dietary [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=578.48s)]
*  stuff and as it relates to Maha, hell to the yes. I mean, I ordered a couple different, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=584.08s)]
*  I went to RFK Jr.'s website and they have the, he has merch, he has Maha merch. I have the green [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=591.9200000000001s)]
*  Maha merch hat. I should have worn it today. I'm all about it. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=599.44s)]
*  Did you get the onesie? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=602.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's amazing. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=604.24s)]
*  The onesie was crazy. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=605.36s)]
*  Your bowl builder, Friedberg, you tried to do this, right? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=607.12s)]
*  It's a. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=609.68s)]
*  It's a and- [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=610.8s)]
*  We had a bowl builder 10 years ago or 2015, yeah, 2016. Diego saw it. He actually visited it when [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=611.92s)]
*  we built it and we designed the system around a canister mechanism. So all the food prep was done [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=619.36s)]
*  in a similar sort of like commissary model and then it was loaded in bulk and then put [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=626.9599999999999s)]
*  into little canisters and there were 30 slots in the canister dispenser and then the canister [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=632.8s)]
*  would move down the device, open up and you could assemble bowls with rice and beans and all sorts [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=638.4799999999999s)]
*  of stuff. The whole thing was automated and we were in the process of building out our first [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=643.52s)]
*  automated store when I actually took a medical leave of absence from Eatsa and ultimately the [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=647.92s)]
*  company did not get it into production, but we had great working demos and it was a very. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=654.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it was just definitely a no-brainer that this is going to happen. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=660.4799999999999s)]
*  You love this. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=663.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and at the time we actually had, I'll tell you guys this, we actually had a term sheet with [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=664.0s)]
*  Chipotle. This was nine years ago to actually put this into Chipotle stores and then we were in the [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=669.12s)]
*  early conversations with Sweetgreen at the time as well and obviously Jonathan and team have gone [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=675.36s)]
*  on to develop their own system, but basically you can reduce so much of like QSR down to this bowl [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=679.2800000000001s)]
*  based system and automated as Travis is doing. So it's just a no-brainer and it's certainly [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=685.7600000000001s)]
*  necessary in a time when there's either a labor shortage or labor price inflation that's causing [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=691.2s)]
*  a real issue with the ability. And yeah, this is the original automats in New York in the early [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=696.6400000000001s)]
*  20th century. I love this. But yeah, they had a commissary behind that wall and they made like [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=702.48s)]
*  plates of food. You put in there, you put a quarter in, you turn the knob and you get your meal out. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=706.96s)]
*  It's the classic, that's the classic artificial artificial intelligence, right? This is like the [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=710.48s)]
*  mechanical Turk thing. I mean, look, here's the thing. Here's a little nuance. It's super [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=714.6400000000001s)]
*  interesting about automation in QSR restaurants is that they have an existing brick and mortar [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=719.04s)]
*  that's built a certain way. That layout is meant for humans and for those humans to work in certain [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=727.1999999999999s)]
*  processes in exact and very specific way. Every square inch of that kitchen and that space is [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=732.64s)]
*  dialed. When you go and put a machine like this in, it changes the whole thing. And so [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=739.12s)]
*  just to get going, you've got to like do, you've got to like, if you're to replace the frontline [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=745.68s)]
*  in Chipotle, you've got to take out that frontline. You got to demo it. You got to put in a new machine. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=750.0799999999999s)]
*  That's the challenge that they all had. And so now it's like a huge amount of capex. My store's [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=756.88s)]
*  down for two to three months and the economics start to not work. And by the way, I still have [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=761.04s)]
*  to have humans in that brick and mortar. And so, you know, look, we have a different take. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=766.88s)]
*  We're in that delivery only model. So these are, it's true infrastructure for making food behind [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=771.36s)]
*  the scenes for delivery. So you don't have these issues. And of course, our setup, our infrastructure, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=778.56s)]
*  these kitchens are designed for these kinds of machines to be in them and vice versa. We've [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=784.48s)]
*  designed the machine to be in them. When we did this early at Eatsa, it was like food delivery [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=789.28s)]
*  was very early. We built these Eatsa restaurants that were smaller footprint. We had an 800 square [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=795.04s)]
*  foot restaurant that was doing 3 million a year in revenue. And it had a handful of people working [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=799.36s)]
*  in it, but we were putting about 800 people an hour during the lunch rush through that restaurant [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=804.48s)]
*  ordering custom bowls. This was by one market, right? That's one market exactly. And so, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=808.16s)]
*  by the way, did you guys notice that J Cal was plugging his product there in the background, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=813.12s)]
*  even though it has absolutely nothing to do with what Travis was saying? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=817.6s)]
*  Oh, welcome back to the show. Nothing's changed. No one else even noticed that. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=820.8000000000001s)]
*  I just heard this voice from above. It was the czar of AI and crypto. I was like, wow. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=827.6s)]
*  That's all. Sit back and listen. The czar's back. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=833.6s)]
*  Sacks, any anecdotes you want to share about life in DC? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=836.88s)]
*  How exciting it's been in the administration the first week? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=841.36s)]
*  It's been amazing. I mean, it's hard to believe it's only been a week, right? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=844.64s)]
*  So you're in the White House or that building next to it? Do you have an office? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=848.24s)]
*  You mean the Treasury building? I don't know. Somebody was talking about [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=851.6800000000001s)]
*  there's a building next to it or something. I don't know. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=854.8s)]
*  I have an office in the old executive office building, otherwise known as the Eisenhower [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=856.9599999999999s)]
*  building. And then I have a pass where I can just walk over to the West Wing if I want to walk [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=861.3599999999999s)]
*  over to it. There's kind of a whole White House complex behind the gates that the West Wing's [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=866.4s)]
*  part of it and the Eisenhower building and there's a couple other buildings in that complex. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=871.4399999999999s)]
*  It's really cool. It is really neat to show up for work at the White House. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=876.7199999999999s)]
*  It's awesome. It's like being in a movie or something or a TV show. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=882.32s)]
*  It is really cool. It's awesome. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=886.08s)]
*  Any interesting meetings you can talk about? I mean, I know we are here today to talk about [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=888.8000000000001s)]
*  DeepSeek, but any interesting meetings or anecdotes from just the vibes and walking around? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=893.28s)]
*  What's the coffee like? Is there a commissary? You run into anybody interesting? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=898.16s)]
*  There is a commissary actually in the White House called the Navy Mess. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=903.36s)]
*  And I think they're just opening up for business now. That is one of the cooler things you can do [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=907.6800000000001s)]
*  is you can take people to lunch at the Navy Mess. Oh, look forward to it. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=913.44s)]
*  Jake, Cal just invited himself. We'll see. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=918.88s)]
*  Look forward to it. I look forward to taking [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=920.72s)]
*  Chamath and Freberg there. I'll wear my MAGA hat. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=922.32s)]
*  All right. Well, let's get started. You're here because we have a very specific... [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=927.52s)]
*  He's here because the world is ending, Jason. The Western world is ending. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=932.24s)]
*  OK, the Western world is ending and David Sachs is going to save it. But we had a little bit of a [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=935.84s)]
*  freak out the last week regarding this DeepSeek. If you don't know, that's a Chinese AI startup. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=939.84s)]
*  They released a new language model. It's called R1. And it's on par basically with some of the [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=945.6800000000001s)]
*  best models in production in the West, like OpenAI's O1 model. But they claim... [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=950.8000000000001s)]
*  Listen, you can trust claims coming out of China for what it's worth. They claim to have done this [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=957.6800000000001s)]
*  all for $6 million, only 2000 GPUs. For comparison, OpenAI spent reportedly $80-$100 million to train [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=963.28s)]
*  GPT-4, which you're all using now. And Sam claims they're going to spend a billion dollars training [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=971.04s)]
*  GPT-5. And so that's about 7% of the cost of GPT-4. Obviously, there are export restrictions on [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=976.48s)]
*  Nvidia H100s to China. So there's a big debate as to if they actually have H1s or not. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=985.6s)]
*  And Monday was a bloodbath in the stock market. Nvidia had the worst day in the history of the [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=993.36s)]
*  stock market in terms of total dollar amount of market cap lost. It was down 17%, which is $600 [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=998.08s)]
*  billion. TSMC was down. ARM was down. Broadcom was down. So I guess everybody's asking the question, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1004.0s)]
*  how did they do this? Did they do it? And then there's a bunch of debate on whether they stole, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1010.0s)]
*  which is kind of rich coming from OpenAI, which got caught red-handed stealing everybody else's [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1016.72s)]
*  content. And now they're crying foul that the Chinese stole or trained, did what's called [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1021.04s)]
*  distillation of their model in order to build theirs. Sax, obviously, you are the czar of AI. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1027.2s)]
*  I'm curious what your take on all this is. And thanks for coming. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1035.92s)]
*  Well, I think one of the really cool things about this job is just that when something [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1040.5600000000002s)]
*  like this happens, I get to kind of talk to everyone and everyone wants to talk. And I [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1044.3200000000002s)]
*  feel like I've talked to maybe not everyone and like all the top people in AI, but it feels like [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1050.0s)]
*  most of them. And there's definitely a lot of takes all over the map on DeepSeq. But I feel [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1055.2s)]
*  like I've started to put together a synthesis based on hearing from the top people in the field. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1059.92s)]
*  It was a bit of a freak out. I mean, it's rare that a model release is going to be a global news [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1065.68s)]
*  story or cause a trillion dollars of market cap decline in one day. And so it is interesting to [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1070.24s)]
*  think about like, why was this such a potent news story? And I think it's because there's two things [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1075.44s)]
*  about that company that are different. One is that obviously, it's a Chinese company rather than [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1082.24s)]
*  an American company. And so you have the whole China versus US competition. And then the other [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1086.16s)]
*  is it's an open source company or at least an open source the R1 model. And so you've kind of [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1092.56s)]
*  got the whole open source versus closed source debate. And if you take either one of those [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1098.32s)]
*  things out, it probably wouldn't have been such a big story. But I think the synthesis of these [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1103.2s)]
*  things got a lot of people's attention. A huge part of TikTok's audience, for example, is [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1107.12s)]
*  international. Some of them like the idea that the US may not win the AI race, that the US is kind [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1112.3999999999999s)]
*  of getting a comeuppance here. And I think that fueled some of the early attention on TikTok. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1118.96s)]
*  Similarly, there's a lot of people who are rooting for open source or they have animosity [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1123.92s)]
*  towards open AI. And so they were kind of rooting for this idea that, oh, there's this open source [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1128.4s)]
*  model that's going to give away what open AI has done at one 20th the cost. So I think all of these [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1134.96s)]
*  things provided fuel for the story. Now I think the question is, okay, what should we make of this? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1140.4s)]
*  I think there are things that are true about the story and then things that are [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1146.72s)]
*  not true or should be debunked. I think that let's call it true thing here is that [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1149.84s)]
*  if you had said to people a few weeks ago that the second company to release a reasoning model [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1156.8799999999999s)]
*  along lines of 01 would be a Chinese company, I think people would have been surprised by that. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1165.92s)]
*  So I think there was a surprise. And just to kind of back up for people, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1171.28s)]
*  there's two major kinds of AI models now. There's kind of the base LLM model like Chat [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1174.96s)]
*  Service separate process as opposed to pre-training. And 01 was the first model released [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1193.8400000000001s)]
*  along those lines. And you can think of a reasoning model as like a smart PhD who doesn't [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1200.24s)]
*  give you a snap answer, but actually goes off and does the work. You can give it a much more [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1206.3200000000002s)]
*  complicated question and it'll break that complicated problem into a subset of smaller problems. And then [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1209.76s)]
*  it'll go step by step to solve the problem. And that's called chain of thought. And so [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1217.44s)]
*  the new generation of agents that are coming are based on this type of idea of chain of thought [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1224.0s)]
*  that an AI model can sequentially perform tasks, figure out much more complicated problems. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1228.5600000000002s)]
*  So OpenAI was the first to release this type of reasoning model. Google has a similar model [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1234.24s)]
*  they're working on called Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking. They've released kind of an early [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1239.76s)]
*  prototype of this called Deep Research 1.5. Anthropic has something, but I don't think they've [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1243.52s)]
*  released it yet. So other companies have similar models to 01 either in the works or in some sort [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1249.76s)]
*  of private beta, but DeepSeq was really the next one after OpenAI to release the full public version [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1257.44s)]
*  of it. And moreover, they open sourced it. And so this created a pretty big splash. And I think it [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1265.36s)]
*  was legitimately surprising to people that the next big company to put out a reasoning model like [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1270.96s)]
*  this would be a Chinese company. And moreover, that they would open source it, give it away for [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1277.44s)]
*  free. And I think the API access is something like one twentieth the cost. So all of these things [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1282.64s)]
*  really did drive the new cycle. And I think for good reason, because I think that if you had asked [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1288.72s)]
*  most people in the industry a few weeks ago, how far behind is China on AI models, they would say [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1294.0800000000002s)]
*  six to 12 months. And now I think they might say something more like three to six months, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1301.6000000000001s)]
*  because 01 was released about four months ago, and R1 is comparable to that. So I think it's [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1307.2s)]
*  definitely moved up people's timeframes for how close China is on AI. Now, we should take the claim [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1313.76s)]
*  that they only did this for $6 million. On this one, I'm with Palmer Lucky and Brad Gerstner and [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1324.24s)]
*  others. And I think this has been pretty much corroborated by everyone I've talked to that [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1331.6000000000001s)]
*  number should be debunked. So first of all, it's very hard to validate a claim about how much money [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1335.68s)]
*  went into the training of this model. It's not something that we can empirically discover. But [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1343.8400000000001s)]
*  even if you accepted it at face value, that $6 million was for the final training run. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1349.92s)]
*  So when the media is hyping up these stories saying that this Chinese company did it for $6 million, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1355.6000000000001s)]
*  and these dumb American companies did it for a billion, it's not an apples to apples comparison. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1361.36s)]
*  If you were to make the apples to apples comparison, you would need to compare the [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1366.8s)]
*  final training run cost by DeepSeek to that of OpenAI or Anthropic. And what the founder of [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1370.8s)]
*  Anthropic said, and what I think Brad has said, being an investor in OpenAI and having talked to [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1379.04s)]
*  them, is that the final training run cost was more in the tens of millions of dollars [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1384.08s)]
*  about nine or 10 months ago. And so it's not $6 million versus a billion. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1391.76s)]
*  Howard Bauchner A billion dollar number might include all the [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1396.6399999999999s)]
*  hardware they bought, the years of putting into it, a holistic number as opposed to the training [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1399.76s)]
*  number. It's not fair to compare, let's call it a soup to nuts number, a fully loaded number [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1404.48s)]
*  by American AI companies to the final training run by the Chinese company. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1410.96s)]
*  Aaron Powell But real quick, Sax, you've got an open source model. And the white paper they put [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1415.92s)]
*  out there is very specific about what they did to make it and sort of the results they got out of it. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1422.96s)]
*  I don't think they give the training data, but you could start to stress test [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1431.1200000000001s)]
*  what they've already put out there and see if you can do it cheap, essentially. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1436.0s)]
*  Like I said, I think it is hard to validate the number. I think that if let's just assume that we [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1439.68s)]
*  give them credit for the 6 million number, my point is less that they couldn't have done it, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1443.92s)]
*  but just that we need to be comparing likes to likes. So if, for example, you're going to look [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1448.0s)]
*  at the fully loaded cost of what it took DeepSeek to get to this point, then you would need to look [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1454.64s)]
*  at what has been the R&D cost to date of all the models and all the experiments and all the training [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1460.96s)]
*  runs they've done and the compute cluster that they surely have. So Dylan Patel, who's leading [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1467.68s)]
*  semiconductor analyst, has estimated that DeepSeek has about 50,000 hoppers. And specifically, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1474.96s)]
*  he said they have about 10,000 H100s. They have 10,000 H800s and 30,000 H20s. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1481.2s)]
*  Aaron Powell Is they DeepSeek or is it DeepSeek plus the hedge fund? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1488.8s)]
*  David Kline DFC plus the hedge fund. But it's the same founder, right? And by the way, that doesn't [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1494.0s)]
*  mean they did anything illegal, right? Because the H100s were banned under export controls in 2022. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1498.0s)]
*  Then they did the H800s in 2023. But this founder was very farsighted. He was very ahead of the [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1505.1200000000001s)]
*  curve. And he was, through his hedge fund, he was using AI to basically do algorithmic trading. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1510.16s)]
*  So he bought these chips a while ago. In any event, you add up the cost of a compute cluster [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1516.5600000000002s)]
*  with 50,000 plus hoppers, and it's going to be over a billion dollars. So this idea that you've [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1523.36s)]
*  got this scrappy company that did it for only 6 million, just not true. They have a substantial [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1528.8799999999999s)]
*  compute cluster that they use to train their models. And frankly, that doesn't count any [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1534.3999999999999s)]
*  chips that they might have beyond the 50,000, that they might have obtained in violation of [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1542.9599999999998s)]
*  export restrictions that obviously they're not going to admit to. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1550.56s)]
*  We just don't know. We don't really know the full extent of what they have. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1554.64s)]
*  So I just think it's worth pointing that out, that I think that part of the story got overhyped. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1559.76s)]
*  Aaron Powell It's hard to know what's fact and what's fiction. Everybody who's on the outside [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1564.72s)]
*  guessing has their own incentive, right? So if you're a semiconductor analyst that effectively is [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1569.6s)]
*  massively bullish Nvidia, you want it to be true that it wasn't possible to train on 6 million [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1577.12s)]
*  dollars. Obviously, if you're the person that makes an alternative that's that disruptive, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1584.56s)]
*  you want it to be true that it was trained on 6 million dollars. All of that, I think, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1588.56s)]
*  is all speculation. The thing that struck me was how different their approach was. And TK just [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1593.36s)]
*  mentioned this, but if you dig into not just the original white paper of DeepSeek, but they've also [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1601.6s)]
*  published some subsequent papers that have refined some of the details, I do think that this is a [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1607.36s)]
*  case, and Sax, you can tell me if you disagree, but this is a case where necessity was the mother [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1613.04s)]
*  of invention. So I'll give you two examples where I just read these things and I was like, man, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1616.9599999999998s)]
*  these guys are like really clever. The first is, as you said, let's put in a pin on whether they [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1621.6799999999998s)]
*  distilled O1, which we can talk about in a second. But at the end of the day, these guys were like, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1628.0s)]
*  well, how am I going to do this reinforcement learning thing? They invented a totally different [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1633.76s)]
*  algorithm. There was the orthodoxy, right? This thing called PPO that everybody used. And they [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1637.76s)]
*  were like, no, we're going to use something else called, I think it's called GRPO or something. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1643.68s)]
*  It uses a lot less computer memory and it's highly performant. So maybe they were constrained, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1648.48s)]
*  Sax, practically speaking by some amount of compute that caused them to find this, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1655.6s)]
*  which you may not have found if you had just a total surplus of compute availability. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1660.32s)]
*  And then the second thing that was crazy is everybody is used to building models and compiling [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1665.12s)]
*  through CUDA, which is Nvidia's proprietary language, which I've said for a couple of times [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1670.0s)]
*  is their biggest moat, but it's also the biggest threat vector for lock-in. And these guys worked [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1676.0s)]
*  totally around CUDA and they did something called PTX, which goes right to the bare metal. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1682.0s)]
*  And it's controllable and it's effectively like writing assembly. Now, the only reason I'm [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1686.48s)]
*  bringing these up is we, meaning the West, with all the money that we've had, didn't come up with [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1691.44s)]
*  these ideas. And I think part of why we didn't come up is not that we're not smart enough to do it, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1697.44s)]
*  but we weren't forced to because the constraints didn't exist. And so I just wonder how we make [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1703.84s)]
*  sure we learn this principle. Meaning when the AI company wakes up and rolls out of bed and some [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1709.52s)]
*  VC gives them $200 million, maybe that's not the right answer for a Series A or a Seed. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1715.44s)]
*  And maybe the right answer is $2 million so that they do these deep Seek-like innovations. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1721.84s)]
*  RICK And Schreint makes for great art. What do you think, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1727.68s)]
*  Friedberg, when you're looking at this? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1730.6399999999999s)]
*  FREDBERG Well, I think it also enables a new class of investment opportunity [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1732.0s)]
*  given the low cost and the speed. It really highlights that maybe the opportunity to create [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1738.48s)]
*  value doesn't really sit at that level in the value chain, but further upstream. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1744.4s)]
*  Bology made a comment on Twitter today that was pretty funny or I think we're [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1748.48s)]
*  focused about the rapper. He's like, turns out the rapper may be the moat, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1752.56s)]
*  which is true at the end of the day. If model performance continues to improve, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1758.56s)]
*  get cheaper, and it's so competitive that it commoditizes much faster than anyone even thought, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1763.12s)]
*  then the value is going to be created somewhere else in the value chain. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1769.6s)]
*  Maybe it's not the rapper. Maybe it's the user. And maybe by the way, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1773.52s)]
*  here's an important point. Maybe it's further in the economy. When electricity production took [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1777.12s)]
*  off in the United States, it's not like the companies are making a lot of money that are [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1782.1599999999999s)]
*  making all the electricity. It's the rest of the economy that accrues a lot of the value. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1785.2s)]
*  You're about to see a big test of this because if open AI raises $40 billion at $340 billion, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1788.72s)]
*  that just hit the wire. The underwriting logic at $340 billion exactly what you just said, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1795.04s)]
*  Freeberg. It is the rapper, meaning chat GPT is the next killer app. It's getting to a billion plus [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1800.8s)]
*  Mao, hundreds of millions of Dow. It's competing for consumer usage. That's the model. That's the [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1806.56s)]
*  model is like consumer usage. Which puts them on a collision course with Meta. It's the only [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1812.16s)]
*  company that could really impact that because the only company right now that has billions of [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1818.16s)]
*  eyeballs of DAUs per day. And by the way, Zuck said this in his earnings release. He's like, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1824.8000000000002s)]
*  there's only going to be one company that brings AI to a billion plus people and it will be us. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1829.76s)]
*  Some version of that quote is in its earnings release yesterday. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1836.16s)]
*  So Zuck. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1839.44s)]
*  Then Microsoft showed weakness in their cloud. And then Microsoft's down 6% today. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1839.76s)]
*  And I think it's a window for open AI to say, we're going to go up against Meta. This is it. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1845.44s)]
*  We're going to be the players. And everyone's kind of ignoring Google at this time, by the way. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1851.92s)]
*  What do you guys think is happening right now between open AI and Microsoft? Because if it's [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1855.6000000000001s)]
*  true that this distillation thing actually happened, well, there's only one place where [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1858.96s)]
*  you could have distilled the O1 model. It's on Azure. So what the hell is going on over there? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1863.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, and there are one is supported on- [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1868.0s)]
*  Explain distillation real quick. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1870.56s)]
*  Yeah. So when you have a big large parameter model, the way that you get to a smaller, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1872.48s)]
*  more usable model along the lines of what Saks mentioned is through this process called [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1878.6399999999999s)]
*  distillation, where the big model feeds the little model. So the little model is asking [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1883.04s)]
*  questions of the big model and you take the answers and you refine. And by the way, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1887.76s)]
*  you can see this, Nick, I sent you a clip. You guys can see this. I mean, there's clearly [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1892.72s)]
*  distillation happening. Nick, can you show the clip of the DeepSeq run where it shows the China [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1896.32s)]
*  answer and then deletes it? What was Winston's job in 1984? And it sort of starts to go through this [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1902.72s)]
*  whole summary. And then the person says, are there any actual states that currently do that? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1907.84s)]
*  Hold on, here it goes. It says, North Korea. Wait, it goes China. And then wait, watch this. Boom. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1914.8799999999999s)]
*  So the reason why this is happening is you're seeing this chain of thought. You're seeing [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1920.56s)]
*  the several layers and then it's catching it after the fact. So we know that this is distilled [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1924.56s)]
*  from some other model. And my only point there, it's the little tongue in cheek, is right now, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1929.2s)]
*  when you go and use OpenAI, you're using it sitting in an Azure instance somewhere. So this [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1935.12s)]
*  is Microsoft's cloud infrastructure that runs it. So it begs the question. It's not that it's [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1941.6s)]
*  O1's fault or OpenAI's fault that this distillation happened. And I'm not trying to assign blame, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1946.96s)]
*  but typically if this were to happen, you'd look to your cloud provider and say, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1951.9199999999998s)]
*  how are you letting this happen? And I don't think anybody's had a good answer for that. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1955.76s)]
*  Aaron Powell Well, and the cloud provider is hosting R1 now. So they're literally undercutting [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1959.76s)]
*  ChatGPT and OpenAI at the same time. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1966.8s)]
*  Dave Korsunsky Just to clean that up, they're hosting their own copy of it, right? Because [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1968.7199999999998s)]
*  R1's been a source. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1972.8799999999999s)]
*  Aaron Powell When you say they, who are you referring to, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1973.6799999999998s)]
*  Sax? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1975.6s)]
*  Dave Korsunsky Microsoft. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1975.9199999999998s)]
*  Microsoft is hosting their version of R1, which means they are actively subverting their partner, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1976.96s)]
*  OpenAI, and pushing people to a cheaper model. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1983.3600000000001s)]
*  Aaron Powell Well, whatever. I mean, look, Amazon's [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1986.88s)]
*  going to host their own version of R1. Grok has a version of R1 that they're hosting. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1988.96s)]
*  Dave Korsunsky Yeah, we have their own. So Rebris just rolled out. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1992.72s)]
*  Aaron Powell It's open source now. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1994.8000000000002s)]
*  Dave Korsunsky Guys have a buddy who has R1 on his laptop. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1996.0800000000002s)]
*  Aaron Powell Yeah, exactly. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1998.16s)]
*  Dave Korsunsky Yeah, but if it was stolen, and the IP was stolen, as Sam is claiming, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=1999.2800000000002s)]
*  you'd think he'd be able to call up Sokta and say, hey, can you not put the stolen IP on your [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2005.2s)]
*  server and promote it to everybody at a lower cost? It just shows Microsoft has no loyalty to OpenAI. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2009.52s)]
*  Aaron Powell The horse is out of the barn. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2014.48s)]
*  Dave Korsunsky Yeah, but you'd think they would have loyalty. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2014.8799999999999s)]
*  Aaron Powell What it would take to distill a one, like, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2017.04s)]
*  brute force? It wouldn't be like, oh, geez, I can't believe it was distilled. It would be like such a [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2021.84s)]
*  massive number of calls against an API or against something. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2028.96s)]
*  Dave Korsunsky Something. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2033.92s)]
*  Aaron Powell That it wouldn't be unnoticed. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2034.64s)]
*  Dave Korsunsky Oh, they did actually came out and said they blocked some suspicious activity recently. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2037.28s)]
*  Aaron Powell No, but they're always doing that. That's constant. You're always doing that. That's [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2041.44s)]
*  like the old school. Go ahead, Zach. Zachary Lona Let me address the distillation point. So I [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2046.4s)]
*  mentioned this a few days ago on Fox News that I thought it was likely or possible that distillation [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2052.64s)]
*  had occurred. There was some evidence for this and it became like a news story. And I didn't even [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2059.7599999999998s)]
*  realize that saying that would be news because it's kind of an open secret in Silicon Valley. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2063.6s)]
*  Everyone I talked to. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2068.24s)]
*  Dave Korsunsky They're doing some level of distillation. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2069.04s)]
*  Aaron Powell Yeah, I mean, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2071.3599999999997s)]
*  Dave Korsunsky Because you need to test your model against theirs anyways. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2071.92s)]
*  Aaron Powell Yeah. And every single person I've talked to [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2074.24s)]
*  basically has agreed that there was some distillation here from OpenAI. Now, that doesn't [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2077.04s)]
*  mean it was the only thing going on here. I mean, to be sure the DeepSeek team is very smart and [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2084.48s)]
*  there were some innovations, but also there was some distillation. And really, this wasn't even [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2089.6s)]
*  a fresh news story, I think, from the point of view of Silicon Valley, because a month ago, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2095.92s)]
*  we had a press cycle in Silicon Valley when DeepSeek's V3 model came out, that DeepSeek [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2101.04s)]
*  V3 was self-identifying as ChatGPT. When you would ask it, who are you? What model are you? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2108.48s)]
*  Five out of eight times, V3 would tell you that it was ChatGPT 4. And there's lots of videos and [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2114.48s)]
*  examples of this online that have been posted, right? The point is that we knew a month ago [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2121.68s)]
*  that V3 had been trained on a substantial amount of ChatGPT output, obviously, because V3 was [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2126.08s)]
*  self-identifying as ChatGPT. And there's two ways that that could have happened. So the, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2132.3199999999997s)]
*  let's call it innocent explanation, is that DeepSeek had crawled the web and found lots of [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2137.52s)]
*  published output from ChatGPT and then trained on that. And that wouldn't be a violation of [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2143.84s)]
*  OpenAI's terms of service or their IP. Or the other explanation would be that they used the API [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2149.52s)]
*  from OpenAI and basically, you know- Went to town. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2157.52s)]
*  Yeah, went to town. And there's no way, I think, based on what we know to prove that one way or [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2160.56s)]
*  another, but I know what most people think happened. And at the end of the day, OpenAI [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2167.2s)]
*  can probably figure it out. And they've indicated that they think there was some [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2172.0s)]
*  improper distillation here. But- [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2175.2s)]
*  Yeah, in the Financial Times, it says, OpenAI says it has found evidence that Chinese artificial [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2178.7999999999997s)]
*  intelligence startup DC used the US company's proprietary models to train its own open source [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2183.52s)]
*  competitor. Right, that's what I'm referring to. So they say- [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2187.2799999999997s)]
*  They've been very clear about this. By the way, you have to be sympathetic, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2189.4399999999996s)]
*  I think, to OpenAI in this, because if you're building a startup, you're trying to raise money. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2192.48s)]
*  We've all gone through this cycle, guys, where it's like, there's momentum. We celebrate internally [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2197.68s)]
*  the momentum. That's what gets you the energy to push your team even further and harder. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2202.4s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, it turns out that some portion of that- [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2208.56s)]
*  Travis said it well, there's probably a chart inside of OpenAI's offices where you're showing [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2212.2400000000002s)]
*  how many times these APIs are getting hit, right? How many times these endpoints are getting hit. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2217.12s)]
*  It all looks positive. And then you realize that some portion of it was actually bad and trying to [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2221.52s)]
*  undercut your value. It's a hard pill to swallow. And then you have to course correct very quickly. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2226.96s)]
*  You have to lock down. This is one area where- Security. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2232.8s)]
*  Exactly. We have not talked about this. You have to lock these models down. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2235.76s)]
*  Now you have to lock the endpoints down. Look, in the Biden administration, if this had happened, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2240.2400000000002s)]
*  the first conversation would have been, we need to KYC the people that use these models. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2245.76s)]
*  And it's like, what are you talking about? We don't KYC the cloud. If you're trying to [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2249.76s)]
*  use an EC2 endpoint or an S3 bucket, you don't have to all of a sudden prove who you are. You [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2253.52s)]
*  just use a credit card and go. That's the whole point of why proliferation can happen so quickly. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2258.72s)]
*  But if we take the wrong takeaways from this period, there's going to be a bunch of people [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2262.88s)]
*  that will clamor to lock these folks down and make innovation go much slower. I think that [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2268.88s)]
*  that would be bad. Here's the other side. And totally agree, Chamath, but here's the other side. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2273.04s)]
*  You go through the white paper. You see what it is they did, what they innovated on. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2277.2s)]
*  The science behind it, the thoroughness. And you're like, these guys are bad ass. It doesn't, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2283.36s)]
*  it does not feel or sound like somebody who took something just when you get through it. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2289.84s)]
*  It could be that, it could be that open AI wrote the white paper for them, just putting it out there, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2295.7599999999998s)]
*  but it's real innovative. I agree with that. Real innovation, strong tech. You're like, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2300.48s)]
*  this is legit. I agree with that. But in that paper, they're very [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2306.56s)]
*  easy about where the data is coming from. And they're fairly transparent about everything [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2310.8s)]
*  else they did, but they're not really clear about the data. And specifically, they say that to get [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2316.72s)]
*  from V3, which is the base model, to R1, which is the reasoning model, they had about 800,000 samples [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2322.32s)]
*  of reasoning. They were quite unclear about where those reasoning samples came from. By the way, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2330.32s)]
*  it is remarkable that you can get from a base model to an R1 with just 800,000 samples. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2338.16s)]
*  But this is the problem. We, meaning the Western AI community, we've been trudging around on this [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2343.2s)]
*  path where we had a very orthodox approach. The only way you can do reinforcement learning is [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2349.12s)]
*  through PPO. Okay, but is that true? And it turns out that if you're a really smart team [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2356.16s)]
*  that has no other choice, you move away and you invent your way out of it. And so we have to get [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2362.24s)]
*  that example too. I think it's technically brilliant, some of the things they've done, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2368.16s)]
*  but they also use constraint as very much a feature, not a bug. And the Western AI economy [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2372.3999999999996s)]
*  has been the opposite so far. I think the best part of this is the fact that Sam Waltman was [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2378.24s)]
*  supposed to be doing open source. He made it a closed source company. He stole everybody's data. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2383.2s)]
*  He got caught red-handed. He's being sued by the New York Times for all that. And now the Chinese [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2388.2400000000002s)]
*  have come and open sourced all the stuff he stole. And he's got a real competitor on the original [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2392.5600000000004s)]
*  mission of what OpenAI was supposed to do. So I have zero sympathy for him or the team over there. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2398.0800000000004s)]
*  I'm glad that this is all going open source. It should have been open source and it's better [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2402.96s)]
*  for humanity. And the fact that the Chinese did it to Sam Waltman has come up for him stealing [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2406.48s)]
*  everybody else's content. That's my opinion. Okay, so you have it. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2410.6400000000003s)]
*  But I don't have strong opinions on it. It's hilarious. Does nobody see the irony in this? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2415.4399999999996s)]
*  He was supposed to be doing open source. I will say the models are closed. You're right. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2421.04s)]
*  There's the lawsuit with Scarlett Johansson for stealing her voice even when she said no. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2428.08s)]
*  There's a real question and people have asked New York Times and then there's now the question [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2432.72s)]
*  about YouTube data being used to train the video models. So there's a lot of being on their on their [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2436.64s)]
*  heels a little bit. So I definitely see your point. Stealing. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2442.0s)]
*  All the pressure right now I think is on Meta because I think Meta has to show up with the [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2448.56s)]
*  next iteration of Llama that beats and exceeds Gemini, that exceeds R1. And I think that that [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2454.0s)]
*  is going to be crucial for us to have a counterweight to whatever China is going to put out after this. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2463.44s)]
*  But I mean, Chamath, it's open source. Does it not kind of... [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2468.72s)]
*  So this is my point. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2472.4s)]
*  Embrace and extend. Embrace and extend. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2473.2s)]
*  Meta has to embrace and extend everything that these guys have shown. Meaning Meta is buying [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2475.44s)]
*  tens of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs. Great. But what did this show? This shows that actually CUDA, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2481.2s)]
*  high level languages in general, I think we've all known that they suck. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2488.8s)]
*  And so we've all been going through it thinking that it's the right thing to do. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2492.96s)]
*  DeepSeek throws it out the window. They use something called PTX. What does Meta do is [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2497.76s)]
*  critical not to understand. They need to embrace this stuff. And this is where I think, again, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2502.0s)]
*  apologies to the NVIDIA bulls, but it's going to create a more heterogeneous environment. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2507.28s)]
*  And the reason is because there's too much money and risk on the line to go through a single point [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2513.52s)]
*  of failure. A chip, a high level framework to get to that chip, that's nuts. So I think like that, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2518.5600000000004s)]
*  Emperor has no clothes moment is upon us. Well, let me ask you another question. Let's [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2525.7599999999998s)]
*  assume that we start the world of AI today. So there's no legacy of the last three years. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2530.0s)]
*  And you wake up today and there's this open source model that's 670 billion parameters. You can run [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2535.2799999999997s)]
*  it on your desktop computer. It's completely available. Everything's completely transparent. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2540.72s)]
*  And I ask you the question, forget about all the big companies that are involved in everyone's [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2545.7599999999998s)]
*  strategy historically. What's the model today to build value here? Where do you build equity value [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2550.16s)]
*  as a business? If you're going to start a company, if you're going to invest as an investor, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2558.16s)]
*  where do you go? The first is you have to build a shim. And I think the reason why a shim is really [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2561.92s)]
*  critical is that there's so much entropy at the model level. What this should show you is you [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2566.56s)]
*  can't pick any model. And the problem is that the people that manipulate these models, the machine [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2571.2s)]
*  learning engineers and whatnot, they become too oriented to understanding how to get output of [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2576.56s)]
*  high quality using one thing. Meaning it shouldn't have been the case that we have engineers that can [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2581.12s)]
*  only use Sonnet. That's the anthropic model. It shouldn't be the case that people can only use [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2586.7999999999997s)]
*  OpenAI or people can only use Llama. Right now, that is kind of what we have. You don't have the [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2592.48s)]
*  flexibility to hot swap as models change. So if you were starting a company today, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2597.6s)]
*  the first technical problem I would want to solve for is that. Because tomorrow, if it's R2 or [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2603.36s)]
*  Alibaba's model or Llama, I would want to be able to rip it out and put it back in and have everything [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2609.84s)]
*  work. And right now we can't do that. The answer to your question is the application layer, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2614.88s)]
*  because this is all going to become storage. It's like YouTube being built on top of storage or [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2623.6800000000003s)]
*  Uber being built on top of GPS. All these innovations are being commoditized and this [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2627.76s)]
*  one is happening faster than all the rest. Do you want to be in the storage business or do you want [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2632.1600000000003s)]
*  to be in the YouTube business? Do you want to be in the Uber business or do you want to be in the [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2635.6000000000004s)]
*  GPS chip business? I mean, they're both decent businesses, but Gavin Baker came on this podcast [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2639.1200000000003s)]
*  and said this is the fastest deprecating asset in the world was a large language model. He's been [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2643.84s)]
*  proven right. They're not worth anything. They're all going to be open source. They're all going to [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2647.6800000000003s)]
*  be commoditized and that's for the best of humanity. And now we're going to be on the [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2651.28s)]
*  application level, the hardware level with robots and I think that's where the opportunity is. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2654.16s)]
*  Travis, what company do you start today? If you start a company today, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2658.48s)]
*  given where the world is at, given the open source models, what do you do? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2663.12s)]
*  Oh, I'm getting so excited. Look, I think the first degree out is, is there a wrapper company? [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2666.8799999999997s)]
*  Okay, so of course, maybe those companies already exist. And then is there a tools company? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2678.24s)]
*  Right. So in a funny way, even though Facebook could be the wrapper, they have a tools business [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2684.8s)]
*  that DeepSeek is basically challenging going full open source and putting something out there [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2691.44s)]
*  that's really good. And what has to happen is Metta has to decide, we are going to embrace [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2698.64s)]
*  and extend this. We're going to make sure that all the developers come to us, that all the cool [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2704.96s)]
*  applications get built here. So I think it's like there's a tools business and then there's [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2709.2s)]
*  the wrapper business. And then, you know, look, when AI, here's the one thing on the Nvidia thing [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2713.76s)]
*  that I would counter with a little bit of what's been said here is like when AI gets cheap, you [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2719.92s)]
*  know what's going to happen guys? There's going to be a lot more AI, right? I think the price [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2724.4s)]
*  elasticity on this one is actually positive. So as the price goes down, the revenue usage, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2730.24s)]
*  everything's going to go up. This is the history of tech forever. Since like Bill Gates said, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2736.0s)]
*  I don't know what to do with more than 64 kilobytes of memory. Like, you know, the question is, did we [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2741.8399999999997s)]
*  cheap oil in the United States drove the industrial revolution, right? And like when we started [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2748.8799999999997s)]
*  discovering oil, suddenly we were able to build factories and make stuff that we never imagined [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2753.04s)]
*  possible. And so then you're like, okay, AI is like, you know, it's going to get cheap. It's [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2757.6s)]
*  going to be oil, but it's also going to be specialized for different tasks. Like you're [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2763.52s)]
*  going to start getting into nuances of like, what is the investor AI look like? What is the [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2768.48s)]
*  autonomous car AI look like? What is the Google search? I'm trying to figure some shit out. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2775.36s)]
*  The lawyer, the accountant, the pilot. So you could go vertical and siloed, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2780.56s)]
*  siloed air quotes. But you understand what I'm saying. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2785.68s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah. So there's a thing called Jevons paradox, which kind of speaks to this concept. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2787.6s)]
*  Satya actually tweeted about it, which is the, it's an economic concept where as the, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2792.3999999999996s)]
*  the cost of a particular use goes down, the aggregate demand for all consumption of that [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2798.3999999999996s)]
*  thing goes up. So the basic idea is that as the price of AI gets cheaper and cheaper, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2804.96s)]
*  we're going to want to use more and more of it. So you might actually get more [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2810.16s)]
*  spending on it in the aggregate. That's right. Because more and more applications [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2814.08s)]
*  will become cost-efficient. Economically feasible. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2817.92s)]
*  Economically feasible. Exactly. That is, I think, a powerful argument for why companies are going to [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2820.4s)]
*  want to continue to innovate on frontier models. You guys are taking a very strong point of view [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2825.52s)]
*  that open source is definitely going to win, that the leading model companies are going to get [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2832.7200000000003s)]
*  commoditized and therefore there'll be no return on capital and basically continue to innovate on [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2836.32s)]
*  the frontier. I'm not sure that's true. For one thing, the R1 model is basically comparable to [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2841.2s)]
*  O1, which OpenAI released four months ago and was training on internally, call it nine or 10 months [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2848.8799999999997s)]
*  ago. So OpenAI is on O3 now. Its frontier is ahead of where R1 is. Anthropic and Google, I think, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2856.48s)]
*  have things in the work and even Meta that may be ahead of where R1 is. So I think R1 or Deep [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2866.24s)]
*  Seek's done a good job being a fast follower here. It's not clear that this is the frontier. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2874.3199999999997s)]
*  Those frontier model companies now, having seen what might have happened with distillation, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2879.9199999999996s)]
*  have a pretty strong incentive to make sure that doesn't happen again. They're going to be taking [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2885.12s)]
*  countermeasures. There's a question of how much you can do to stop it. But I think it's a little [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2890.4799999999996s)]
*  premature to conclude that there's no reward for being at the frontier. Anybody have any other [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2895.36s)]
*  questions for Sachs before we drop him off to go back to serving the American people before we drop [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2900.96s)]
*  him off? One final point on the whole open source versus closed source. Look, I'm not going to take [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2906.56s)]
*  sides in that, but I think that it's a mistake to just view what happened here as, oh, it's this [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2911.28s)]
*  plucky upstart that's doing the community a huge service out of the goodness of its heart. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2920.08s)]
*  It's basically open sourcing all this stuff. Oh, they stole it. They stole it. It's the Chinese. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2925.6800000000003s)]
*  Come on. You still have this huge geopolitical aspect to it. Deep Seek is a Chinese company, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2930.32s)]
*  and they're trying to catch up. If you're behind and you're trying to catch up, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2936.56s)]
*  then open source is a strategy that actually really makes sense for you. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2940.32s)]
*  They're trying to basically undercut the leading American companies. I don't think they did it with [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2945.6800000000003s)]
*  $6 million. They have massive resources behind them. I think some of the pro Deep Seek vibes, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2950.8s)]
*  I think, they're a little bit naive in Silicon Valley. It's like- [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2958.96s)]
*  That's only the people who worked for Sam previously and quit who feel that way. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2963.28s)]
*  I think there's a lot of support for Deep Seek in Silicon Valley because, again, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2969.1200000000003s)]
*  people think that they're doing this huge service for the community. I think it's a little bit more [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2974.5600000000004s)]
*  self-interested than that. It could be both. There is a theory that they're trying to undercut [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2978.0s)]
*  and neuter the lead, and at the same time, there's a bunch of people who believe in open source, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2983.2s)]
*  and nobody should control this. Certainly not Sam Waltman should be the person who controls it. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2988.24s)]
*  So two things could be true at the same time. David, thank you so much for coming on. We [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2991.44s)]
*  appreciate it. Thank you for all your hard work and service. Thank you, David. I know that this is- [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=2995.68s)]
*  Thank you for coming on. You're a scholar. You're a scholar. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3001.28s)]
*  Thank you. All right. Thanks to David Sachs for coming in. I guess, let's open up the aperture [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3004.4s)]
*  here and talk a little bit about relations with China. We're obviously in a bit of a Cold War [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3012.64s)]
*  with them. We have tariffs. We have Taiwan, and then we have the trade war going on here with [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3018.4s)]
*  exports of H100s. Where do we want to start, gentlemen? Travis, you've got some deep- You're [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3027.12s)]
*  one of probably five American entrepreneurs who ran an at-scale business with Uber and the D.D. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3033.68s)]
*  relationship in China, so you have a unique position of understanding business in this, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3039.7599999999998s)]
*  along with maybe Tim Cook and Elon are the only other two people who've really had an [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3044.24s)]
*  at-scale business there. Maybe Disney. They have Disneyland there. What's your take on the relationship [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3047.8399999999997s)]
*  and what's going on in your geopolitical- How's China going to operate differently than the U.S., [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3053.68s)]
*  Travis, from your experience, your point of view? Tell us a little bit about the culture and business [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3058.0s)]
*  ethics in China, particularly as it relates to AI development. Okay, so look, I had this thing. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3062.08s)]
*  I'm going back almost 10 years here, Uber day. We're running Uber China, and I mean, I cannot, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3070.0s)]
*  there's no way I could express the frenetic intensity of copying that they would do [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3080.0s)]
*  on everything that we would roll out in China. It was so epically intense that I basically had a [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3088.16s)]
*  massive amount of respect for their ability to copy what we did. I just couldn't believe it. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3099.52s)]
*  We would do real hard work, make it, we'd dial it, and it would be epic, and it would be awesome. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3107.12s)]
*  We'd roll it out, and then two weeks later, boom, they've got it. A week later, boom, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3112.8s)]
*  they've got it. Of course, I use that to drive our team, and there's so many great stories. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3119.36s)]
*  I mean, we had 400 Chinese nationals in Silicon Valley. At our offices in San Francisco, we had [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3125.04s)]
*  a whole floor for the China growth team, and it was primarily Chinese nationals. We had billboards [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3134.8s)]
*  on the 101 in Silicon Valley in Chinese, Uber billboards to join our team in Chinese [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3142.08s)]
*  to serve the homeland. It was like an all out war. It was really epic. It was epic. By the way, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3150.88s)]
*  when you went to that floor in our office, you were in China. They rolled China style. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3158.3199999999997s)]
*  The desks were literally smaller. The density of the space, it was China. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3165.04s)]
*  But what happens is when you get really, really good at copying, and that time gets tighter and [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3172.72s)]
*  tighter and tighter and tighter and tighter, you eventually run out of things to copy. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3179.52s)]
*  And then it flips- To creativity. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3184.64s)]
*  To creativity and innovation. Now, at the beginning, it's sort of all over the place. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3187.2s)]
*  The kind of innovation when it was new was like, what? You're like, really? But as they [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3193.68s)]
*  exercise that muscle, it gets better and better and better. So if you want to know about the [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3199.6s)]
*  future of food, like online food delivery, you don't go to New York City. You go to Shanghai. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3204.3199999999997s)]
*  Hmm. What's an example of something really innovative they're doing? [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3211.12s)]
*  Doesn't Meituan do drone delivery and stuff? Here's an example. If you went to offices like, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3215.6s)]
*  let's say, Shanghai, Beijing, any of the major cities, Hangzhou, et cetera, the office buildings [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3221.8399999999997s)]
*  have hundreds of lockers around their perimeter so that everything that you get, whether it be [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3228.88s)]
*  food or anything else, but especially food, is just the couriers drop them off in these lockers [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3236.56s)]
*  at the office buildings. And then there are a whole other set of people that are sort of [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3244.8s)]
*  inter-office- Runners. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3250.32s)]
*  Runners that then bring it to your office. As an example, and when you see it, you're like, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3252.56s)]
*  and it's epically efficient. And they're taking advantage of their economics on labor and things [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3258.16s)]
*  like this. It wouldn't exactly work that way here, but a lot of the innovation you will see [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3264.0s)]
*  coming out in Uber Eats or DoorDash, the stuff that's coming out now is stuff that existed [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3270.7999999999997s)]
*  three years ago, four years ago in China, maybe longer. So eventually you cross that threshold [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3277.92s)]
*  of copying and you are innovating and then you're leading. And I think we see that in a whole bunch [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3283.92s)]
*  of different places. Yeah. Here's a look at these smart lockers that you can see. You're just [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3290.4s)]
*  available for sale when you go online, but yeah, these things are crazy. And you've experimented [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3295.2000000000003s)]
*  with those as well. Didn't you have a commissary concept in DTLA? Well, look, okay, so we've got a [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3299.76s)]
*  couple of things. So we have in every one of our facilities, and we've got hundreds of them, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3305.04s)]
*  and we'll have lockers there. So the courier then waves their phone in front of a camera. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3309.76s)]
*  The right locker pops open, they get the food from there and they go. The courier pickup is [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3316.0s)]
*  asynchronous from production of food. You don't have lines anymore. There's no more lines, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3320.88s)]
*  which then speeds up delivery, shortens the amount of time, shortens, reduces how much [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3326.0800000000004s)]
*  money you spend on couriers. And we've got a whole other thing. This doesn't work. It probably [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3331.6s)]
*  wouldn't work in China because, well, for a lot of reasons, but let me explain what it is. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3339.68s)]
*  It's called Picnic, where if you are in an office building, you order food, you go to a website, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3344.3199999999997s)]
*  you order whatever it is from a hundred different restaurants. Those restaurants happen to be in my [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3351.68s)]
*  facilities. And there'll be one courier that goes to one of our facilities and picks up 50 orders at [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3355.6s)]
*  a time, brings it to an office, puts it, there's a shelf on every floor. You get notified when your [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3362.0s)]
*  food arrives and it arrives the same time every day. And you just go to the shelf, get it on your [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3367.44s)]
*  floor and dip that right back into your meeting, saving people time at the office, giving them [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3372.64s)]
*  selection on food, especially in food deserts. But even going, like there's a sweet green right [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3378.96s)]
*  down there in my current, in my office right now, I can say 20 minutes by just using our own service [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3383.52s)]
*  versus doing that. And you get at the same price because the courier economics, the courier is [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3389.84s)]
*  delivering 50 orders at a time. So courier costs go basically to zero. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3394.32s)]
*  Aaron Powell What do we think of the export controls here? Should we, Chamath, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3398.72s)]
*  be maybe banning more H100s or other chipsets going there, or is that futile? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3403.52s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that. And I think that's, I think Saxon, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3409.04s)]
*  President Trump will make a good decision. But here's the curious case of the export controls. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3413.6s)]
*  Nick, I sent you a couple of tweets if you want to just bring this up. So the first thing that [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3420.8799999999997s)]
*  people are claiming is that DeepSeq is getting access to a bunch of NVIDIA GPUs using Singapore [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3425.92s)]
*  as a backdoor. So essentially you create a Singaporean shell company, you place an order [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3433.84s)]
*  with NVIDIA, NVIDIA fulfills that into Singapore, and then the chips go someplace. And so there's a [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3439.52s)]
*  bunch of examples where people are saying that you're talking about up to a quarter of all NVIDIA [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3447.1200000000003s)]
*  revenue goes into Singapore. And the speculation right now is that 100% of those then go into China, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3452.56s)]
*  which is an enormous claim because that's a huge amount of NVIDIA's revenue. Now the interesting [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3462.8s)]
*  thing is if you actually try to understand, well, maybe that's not true. And maybe it's sitting [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3468.8s)]
*  inside of Singapore. This is where that kind of unravels. So just to be clear, Singapore is about [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3473.76s)]
*  250 or 260 square miles. It's like a small, small place. Also the TikTok headquarters. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3480.0s)]
*  And I tried to find out how many data centers are in Singapore and it's about 100. And so you would [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3487.36s)]
*  think that, okay, well, what does that mean? 100 could mean anything. But then you look at the [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3493.92s)]
*  energy and they publish that. And all of those 100 data centers consume about 876 megawatts. So these [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3498.56s)]
*  are small data centers, right? And the entire industry is like a one and a half, two billion [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3506.0s)]
*  dollar revenue business. So I do think that Sachs and the administration are going to have to dig [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3512.4s)]
*  into this and figure out what their opinion should be. But there is clearly a ton of these chips going [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3517.76s)]
*  into Singapore. I don't think anybody knows where they end up. And the question is, what does America [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3525.6000000000004s)]
*  think about that? And why did we implement these export controls in the first place? And if there's [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3532.32s)]
*  a simple back door, how do you want to react? If the US finds a path, I mean, let's talk about [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3536.4s)]
*  what happened with sanctions in Russia and other prior kind of sanctioning efforts around the world. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3541.7599999999998s)]
*  But as you kind of close the floodgates and close access, the buyer or the receiver of those goods [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3547.92s)]
*  or that capital are going to look elsewhere. They're going to look to create a market somewhere [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3557.2s)]
*  else. And so if we do cut off access to Nvidia chips, we do cut off access to US exports, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3561.68s)]
*  are we not kind of recognizing that the second order effect of that is that China will take [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3569.2s)]
*  IP that they've stolen, copies that they've made to Travis's point, and develop and build out their [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3574.48s)]
*  own fabs, and they'll find ways to copy the ASML technology. And, you know, at the end of the day, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3580.2400000000002s)]
*  there's a lot to put together. And I know it's deeply technically complex. But if ever there were [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3585.2s)]
*  a group of people in the history of human civilization to pull it off, it's probably the [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3589.6s)]
*  modern Chinese to be able to say, let's go build our own infrastructure. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3593.68s)]
*  It's worse than that. This is a great point, but it's worse than that. The models today are capable [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3597.68s)]
*  of designing chips for you that don't rely on the most complicated technologies that ASML creates. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3603.68s)]
*  I mean, look, one of the luckiest things that happened to Grok is we designed our chip at 14 [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3610.48s)]
*  nanometer, which is effectively in the spectrum of technology like VHS and beta. So we chose a [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3616.7999999999997s)]
*  simple, simple technology stack to build towards. The latest cutting edge chips at like two nanometer [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3623.36s)]
*  that use these complicated ASML machines, it's not clear that the yield is actually that good. So [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3629.84s)]
*  why would you spend all that money? And if China is forced to engineer its way around it, [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3635.92s)]
*  yeah, Freeberg, the answer to your question is they'll use these models to design chips [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3640.5600000000004s)]
*  that can be manufactured in simple ways, and they'll make simple stuff. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3645.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm just not sure it solves the problem is my point. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3649.2s)]
*  Well, it doesn't. And this is why I think it doesn't solve the real problem, which is how do [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3653.12s)]
*  we incentivize people in America to really out-engineer and out-innovate? [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3657.9199999999996s)]
*  Competition. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3662.0s)]
*  Or AI ushers in an era of extraordinary abundance, and that abundance ultimately reduces the drive [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3662.96s)]
*  for conflict and things are better off. Or the other version as well is that China could just [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3669.6s)]
*  bear the cost as a central authority of building an incredibly great model, right? And they will [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3675.04s)]
*  spend all the money, and then they will tell the Chinese companies, you can distill from this model [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3682.4s)]
*  for free because we have a golden vote and a seat on your board anyways, which is effectively de [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3687.68s)]
*  facto what happens if you get big enough in China. So there's that possibility as well, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3692.32s)]
*  where one central authority bears the capex of creating something that then everybody else can [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3696.08s)]
*  can draft off of. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3701.36s)]
*  And let's talk a little bit about OpenAI. They're in Washington asking for money now. Is that the [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3703.2s)]
*  concept now? Is that our government should back? [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3709.2s)]
*  The rumor today was they're raising $40 billion at a $340 billion pre-money with [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3712.16s)]
*  MASA potentially being the lead. I would love Travis's read on this because Travis has taken [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3717.7599999999998s)]
*  large money from MASA in the past and has been through this, but how does he think about and [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3722.9599999999996s)]
*  make this decision? Obviously, we all know, and I mentioned you guys at the meeting I had with him [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3728.0s)]
*  last summer where he basically kicked me out of the room because my company is not generative AI. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3731.36s)]
*  Someone said you should go meet with MASA. So I'm like, sure, I'll sit down with him and start [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3736.7200000000003s)]
*  talking. And he just looked at me and he's like, this is not generative AI. I only do generative [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3739.28s)]
*  AI. I think your company will be very successful. You will be very successful. Goodbye. And he [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3745.1200000000003s)]
*  just walked out and that was like the end of everything. That's all he's doing now. So this [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3748.6400000000003s)]
*  is the big bet, right? So, okay, so I need to bust a myth. I did not take money from MASA. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3753.76s)]
*  So he begged me to take money for years and we did not take it because he is a, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3760.56s)]
*  he's a, what's the word I'm looking for? He's a permiscuous investor. So once he invests in you, [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3768.32s)]
*  you should probably count on him and using your information and investing in all of your [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3776.96s)]
*  competitors. At least that's historically what he's done. So I didn't go there, but then he just [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3781.04s)]
*  kept investing in all my competitors and they kept subsidizing these markets. And then I'm like, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3786.08s)]
*  maybe I should have just saturated soaked up the money that was there. So the one of the things [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3791.36s)]
*  you should think about, like when you look at like, oh, is open AI taking a lot of money from a MASA [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3795.84s)]
*  type situation is it's a little bit of like a double-edged sword is if you don't take that [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3800.96s)]
*  money, it goes somewhere else. But if you do take that money, just know that whatever intelligence [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3806.4s)]
*  they get, when they go through the process of giving you the money and maybe hanging around [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3811.84s)]
*  the board or who knows what is going to be used to do other things. And that is the nature of the [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3815.6s)]
*  MASA machine. So you're damned if you do damned if you're, but you got to pick. And if the money's [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3821.44s)]
*  going and it's flowing and, and access to capital is a strategic competitive weapon or advantage, [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3826.48s)]
*  you must, you must play ball. Now we were able to, we, we, we did stuff with the Saudis before even [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3832.7999999999997s)]
*  vision fund existed. They stroked a three and a half billion dollar check when that was like the [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3839.52s)]
*  biggest thing that ever happened. So we were okay with not having the MASA money, but that MASA money [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3843.68s)]
*  then went to all of our competitors. Door dash. And so in this open AI context, Travis, I mean, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3849.9199999999996s)]
*  like just knowing what you know about AI, is this going to be a competitive advantage [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3856.08s)]
*  for Sam to raise 40 billion? Where does it go when he's up against, we don't know what in China, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3860.3199999999997s)]
*  Microsoft, alphabet and meta. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3868.24s)]
*  Well, look, I think this goes to some of the things that Shamatha is saying, which is like, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3870.7999999999997s)]
*  if, if constraint is the mother of invention or whatever that, that euphemism is, the, the, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3875.7599999999998s)]
*  the aphorism is, if that's the case, you get into a real weird spot when you get over [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3882.3999999999996s)]
*  capital over capitalized in the, in the Uber model, like the war was subsidizing rides [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3889.68s)]
*  for market share, essentially being the wrapper for transportation and using the parlance we were [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3897.28s)]
*  using earlier in the, in, in this discussion. So it was necessary. You're screwed if you don't. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3902.0s)]
*  The question is, do you get to this place of overcapitalized too big deal, too bureaucratic, [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3909.44s)]
*  too loose, too weak, too soft with when you have an open source model, that's very smart [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3916.4s)]
*  and it's a thousand flowers blooming, lots of innovation happening everywhere could be an [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3923.6s)]
*  overwhelming force. Now I think there's going to be different sectors treated different ways. We're [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3929.7599999999998s)]
*  like going full stack and certain industry sectors is going to matter. And then in other places, [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3934.72s)]
*  having like a very sort of chaotic, everybody does a little slice is going to be okay in other [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3939.92s)]
*  places. And I think we could probably spend days or hundreds of dozens of hours just talking about [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3944.8s)]
*  the nuances there. Well, it seems like there's some degree of relationship between the Stargate [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3952.48s)]
*  announcement with Masha and Sam standing up there with Larry and then Sasha showing up in the [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3958.0800000000004s)]
*  conversation as well. And this raise and the idea that more hardware, more infrastructure faster [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3963.2000000000003s)]
*  creates a moat. And I guess that's the real thing you have to believe, which becomes harder to [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3971.1200000000003s)]
*  believe in the context of what happened in the last week. I personally think that these models [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3977.12s)]
*  are, and I've said this for a while, it doesn't make sense to have one large do everything model, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3982.24s)]
*  this mixture of experts architecture. Ultimately, you can kind of think about taking a large model, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3989.6s)]
*  making two copies of it, and then trying to shrink each model down to whatever the [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3994.7999999999997s)]
*  necessary so that you run two models in less frequently, meaning that that combination of two [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=3999.52s)]
*  models uses less power and takes less time. And then you do the same thing again, and you shrink [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4004.64s)]
*  it down to four and then 12. And eventually you have lots of smaller models, some of which [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4010.48s)]
*  in some cases are experts at one thing like doing mathematics or reading or writing. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4015.68s)]
*  But the reality is we don't know how whether humans have kind of thought about the world the [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4020.08s)]
*  right way that the AI may resolve to having smaller expert models that we don't really [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4024.08s)]
*  understand why that's the expert on something. But you have a network of very small kind of [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4028.16s)]
*  things that work together. And that ultimately leads to a commoditization, not just in kind of [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4032.24s)]
*  model cost and in development and runtime, but also in what's needed. Do you really create much [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4037.2799999999997s)]
*  of an advantage by having all these data centers? Do you create much of an advantage? [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4044.08s)]
*  This is the key point, I think, Freiburg, is that you're not going to get an advantage by having [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4047.12s)]
*  more H100s at a certain point. And the actual advantage is going to be in the IP and owning [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4050.3199999999997s)]
*  content. And the really smart thing to do would be for somebody to go buy Reddit, Quora, the New [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4055.68s)]
*  York Times, the Washington Post, and Disney and take all that IP and then not allow other people [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4060.88s)]
*  to use it, sue the hell out of them every time they try. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4066.0s)]
*  I take Washington Post off that list, but yes. New York Times comes off the list too. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4068.32s)]
*  Well, whatever. I mean, all those archives are definitely going to be, what would be great about [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4073.6800000000003s)]
*  those is you could then like a patent troll, then tell anybody else who's absorbed New York Times [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4079.84s)]
*  stories historically or Disney IP historically, and you could just sue the hell out of them. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4084.88s)]
*  And then you've got the best, most proprietary one. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4088.8s)]
*  And Reddit keeps giving. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4092.0800000000004s)]
*  You're describing text. So you're describing text content, which is a fraction of where... [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4093.36s)]
*  Also video. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4097.68s)]
*  This is important. So video, I think you can recognize that Google's YouTube content library [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4098.16s)]
*  is probably 100 to 200 times larger than the rest of the internet combined. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4103.2s)]
*  But they don't have the right to do it. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4107.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, they do actually. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4108.88s)]
*  So you're such an old school copyright guy. You're such an old school media guy, by the way. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4110.72s)]
*  Sorry, I believe in artists and their right to content. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4115.4400000000005s)]
*  We've had a series of conversations that I feel very confident to tell you that they do have the [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4118.32s)]
*  right in a good chunk of that content, not in a lot of the copyrighted content that the big media [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4123.04s)]
*  companies have given them, but a lot of user generated content. They do have the right and [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4126.88s)]
*  they are using it and they're legally doing it. And then there's the separate kind of body of [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4130.64s)]
*  content, which I think comes, for example, from Tesla. Tesla has an extraordinary advantage that [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4135.28s)]
*  they were really pressured to put cameras on everything years ago. And that gives them this [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4139.68s)]
*  ability to build models that do self-driving. So I think that there's a lot more data advantage [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4143.84s)]
*  that arises in certain industry segments than others. And that's where the moat will lie. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4149.2s)]
*  And that moat will allow you to actually build better products that get you a more [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4153.4400000000005s)]
*  persistent advantage in gathering more data. That's ultimately where I think this resolves to. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4156.400000000001s)]
*  It may not necessarily be about who's got the biggest data center network. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4160.56s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, here's the thing, guys. At some point, the amount of data becomes the long [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4164.64s)]
*  pole in the tent. At some point, the quality of the algorithms becomes a long pole in the tent [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4170.16s)]
*  and more compute is not going to change that. I don't think we're there yet. That's the one [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4175.76s)]
*  thing that counters the cheap AI means more AI is, is there enough data and or algorithms [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4182.08s)]
*  to make the more AI, to make it work? And I do agree with the siloing it and getting expert [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4190.0s)]
*  and getting better in these ways. But I think this is an interesting trade-off between some [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4196.4s)]
*  of these variables. I got offered 2,500 bucks to put Angel, my book, into because Harper Collins [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4201.36s)]
*  did a deal with Microsoft. 2,500 per year? I think it's for three years is the license. And [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4207.36s)]
*  they just did this blanket license for every book. They didn't look at yourself. They didn't look at [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4214.96s)]
*  how desirable it was. It was just like a blanket deal. Everybody gets 2,500 bucks per book [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4218.96s)]
*  for three years. And I think I'm going to just do it just to support proper licensing so that [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4223.6s)]
*  people can start going down this path. But let's get into Doge. It's been a, I think we're in [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4228.56s)]
*  10 days into this administration and Trump formally established Doge, the Department of [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4233.6s)]
*  Government Efficiency in an executive order. Apparently, Elon's been spending a lot of time [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4240.64s)]
*  at the offices. A bunch of wins. Doge is claiming on the interwebs to be saving American taxpayers [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4245.52s)]
*  around a billion dollars a day. That's $3 for every American every day, about $1,000 a year in [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4253.68s)]
*  savings for each US citizen. And they claim they can triple this. And so for a Family Five, that'd [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4258.56s)]
*  be about $15,000 a year, maybe $60,000 during Trump's second term. We got $36 trillion in debt. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4263.280000000001s)]
*  Have fun with some numbers there if you like. But the key announcement was a very similar to [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4270.16s)]
*  the Twitter execution, the ability for people to resign done in a very kind way. Eight months of [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4277.5199999999995s)]
*  severance-ish is being offered to federal workers. They expect 5 to 10% of federal workers to take [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4284.16s)]
*  this buyout. And it's, I mean, this could be something like $100 billion in savings. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4290.5599999999995s)]
*  Eight months of severance is not actually a legal concept that you can do. So these are some sort [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4299.36s)]
*  of buyouts. And there's obviously some hand-wringing about it, but I think they're off to a good start. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4305.12s)]
*  They've also been canceling leases, as we talked about, you know, pre-election. There is so much [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4311.2s)]
*  space not being used that the federal government is terminating a ton of stuff they own and going [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4317.839999999999s)]
*  to sell it and consolidating folks. And at the same time, all of this is happening, everybody has [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4324.48s)]
*  to return to office. Who wants to go first here with, you know, the sort of first 10 days of doge? [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4334.0s)]
*  I see some eggplant emojis in the group chat. First 10 days of doge. How exciting. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4342.719999999999s)]
*  How do I get on this group chat? What's that about? I'm adding you right now. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4347.2s)]
*  Yeah, how are you not in the group chat? Get in the group chat. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4349.679999999999s)]
*  I'm adding you right now. I'm adding you right now. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4351.5199999999995s)]
*  Literally every time one of these hits the group chat, it's just hilarious. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4352.64s)]
*  Eggplants. People are like, oh my God, we're not burning taxpayer dollars. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4357.04s)]
*  And the eggplant always comes from Freeberg first. I'm outing him as an eggplant. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4363.76s)]
*  I'm a big doge eggplant guy. So much eggplant. So Freeberg, tell us about [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4368.08s)]
*  how much eggplant you love this. There's nothing that I would say is [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4375.52s)]
*  particularly surprising in the first week. A lot of this was kind of talked about leading up to [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4378.88s)]
*  the inauguration. Vivek and Elon published their piece in the Wall Street Journal a couple of weeks [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4383.92s)]
*  ago. They talked about the mechanisms of action that they could utilize to kind of drive reduction [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4389.36s)]
*  in cost. One of which was come back to the office. Another one of which is, you know, [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4396.08s)]
*  giving people a buyout offer. And by the way, the buyout offer is not new. Bill Clinton did the same [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4401.36s)]
*  thing during his presidency. If you guys remember when he tried to balance the budget, [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4407.04s)]
*  get to a surplus, which he did successfully. And his intention was to actually reduce US [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4411.36s)]
*  debt to zero by the year 2013. And he had a very specific economic and fiscal plan for doing that, [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4416.0s)]
*  which he put into place. Incredible era. I think we're seeing them take the actions [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4421.28s)]
*  that they said they would do. They said they would demand to employees, federal employees, [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4426.48s)]
*  come back to the office. And they assumed some degree of attrition from that. And now the buyout [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4430.72s)]
*  offer and we'll see how far things go with the courts with respect to their ability to stop [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4435.12s)]
*  a legislative or statutorily mandated spending. There's a big question mark here on how much [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4441.5199999999995s)]
*  authority the executive branch has in stopping spending and how much they're not allowed to [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4447.68s)]
*  stop because it's demanded by laws, demanded by Congress and acts or laws that have passed. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4454.5599999999995s)]
*  And so that's going to be the big test here. Over the next couple of months, a lot of lawsuits will [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4459.76s)]
*  fly. The courts will ultimately adjudicate and we'll see how far the Doge intention can take [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4464.08s)]
*  things. And then there's a separate set of efforts around legislative action here. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4470.4s)]
*  There's about a $2 trillion annual deficit right now in the United States federal government, [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4474.5599999999995s)]
*  $2 trillion a year. And if you look at the D'Aulio book on why countries go broke, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4479.68s)]
*  there's a pretty simple kind of arithmetic in there, which is not complicated. It's just at [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4484.64s)]
*  the end of the day, the U.S. needs to get our federal deficit down below 3% of GDP, [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4488.56s)]
*  which means we've got to cut about a trillion, trillion one of spending. If we can do that, [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4494.96s)]
*  then we're in kind of a more economically sound place. By the way, a really important point, [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4499.84s)]
*  which is in the D'Aulio interview, as you cut spending, interest rates will come down [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4503.84s)]
*  because right now there's a pretty significant sell off in treasuries and a lot of risk associated [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4509.04s)]
*  with the U.S.' ability to deliver its debt obligations over the next 30 years, which is why [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4513.280000000001s)]
*  30-year treasuries are at 5% right now. Even though the Federal Reserve is cutting rates, [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4518.24s)]
*  the rate on treasuries is going up. People are still selling off treasuries. That will stop- [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4523.36s)]
*  It's also inflationary. It's also inflationary, Dave. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4527.5199999999995s)]
*  That's right. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4530.08s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4530.639999999999s)]
*  And so as we cut spending, we also will see that there'll be less inflation and the U.S. ability [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4531.2s)]
*  to pay back their debt obligations over the next 30 years goes up, so the rates will come down. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4538.8s)]
*  And so there's actually a really nice kind of cyclical effect as these cuts start to come into [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4543.36s)]
*  play. The rate at which you can make the cuts actually affects the amount of cuts you have to [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4547.28s)]
*  make. The faster you make the cuts, the less you have to cut. And that's a really key kind of [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4551.92s)]
*  principle going into this, which I think we should expect a big whirlwind of cutting in the next [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4555.599999999999s)]
*  couple of months or an attempt to. The courts will adjudicate what needs to be legislated, [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4559.84s)]
*  and then they're going to go to Congress and start to try and get some of these cuts in. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4563.92s)]
*  But I will tell you once again, after our visit in D.C. last week, there was not a single member [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4566.5599999999995s)]
*  of Congress that I spoke with who views cutting to be a mandate for them in the laws that they're [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4571.04s)]
*  trying to pass. They all have a very different kind of agenda than Doge. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4575.92s)]
*  Soterios Johnson Well, look, this is really one of those interesting things where it's like [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4578.56s)]
*  the difference between legislature and executive branch is like Doge is really bringing it to life, [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4584.0s)]
*  what powers and controls does the executive branch have to spend and not to spend? And especially to [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4592.4800000000005s)]
*  not spend when it's been legislated to spend. This is where the action is. There's no law that [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4599.6s)]
*  says you can give a bunch of folks eight months of severance and they're gone and you don't replace [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4606.400000000001s)]
*  them. There's no law that says that. The executive branch, and again, I don't know all the laws, [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4613.04s)]
*  sort of the rules or laws about how they go about doing it, but let's say presumably they're doing [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4618.72s)]
*  this and there's some legal backing behind it, like they just go and do it and now they're not [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4623.92s)]
*  spending money. If it was really hard to hire people, and they could even make it harder to [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4629.36s)]
*  hire people, do they fight bureaucracy with bureaucracy that it's harder to spend, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4634.96s)]
*  harder to hire people, harder to procure certain things that you're supposed to spend money on? [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4640.4s)]
*  You can reduce this spend through a lot of very interesting nuanced [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4646.32s)]
*  friction rules that they're in control of. Soterios Johnson [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4650.72s)]
*  Yeah, some friction could slow things down. They're talking about putting competency tests in, [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4653.12s)]
*  they're talking about giving people reviews, and maybe they have to hit some standards. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4657.84s)]
*  The gentleman's riff. When you force people to come back to the office, you're going to lose five, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4661.5199999999995s)]
*  10% of people and 10% take the buyout and now all of a sudden we're saving things. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4665.28s)]
*  Soterios Johnson I mean, it'll be interesting to see if it's five or 10% on RTO. It could be a lot [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4669.44s)]
*  more. What I'm hearing about these buildings is that they are super, super empty, next level empty. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4674.72s)]
*  Let's just say I'm really glad I don't hold it like I'm an owner that has a bunch of leases [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4683.44s)]
*  to the federal government right now. Soterios Johnson [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4691.36s)]
*  And you know what the interesting thing about those leases, I was talking to the team at Density, [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4694.72s)]
*  which does people counting and building, so they obviously are very interested in that. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4698.16s)]
*  The government is such a reliable client that they're all on one-year leases. So people don't [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4702.24s)]
*  do what they do with startups, we just force them to do five or 10 years because they know, [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4709.44s)]
*  hey, this company could go out of business. They're just like, yeah, yeah, we're just on [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4712.72s)]
*  a rolling year over year lease. So you can actually just cut these. It's going to flood [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4715.4400000000005s)]
*  the market. Chamath, your thoughts on also the stopping of because they're obviously going for [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4719.52s)]
*  it. They stopped all payments, which is a part of the playbook. I saw a Twitter up close and personal, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4725.6s)]
*  which is, hey, let's turn off subscriptions and see if anybody's using these subscriptions basically. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4732.0s)]
*  Obviously a judge got involved in that, but aid going to other countries. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4738.320000000001s)]
*  We're just starting to look at what are we actually sending to other countries and for what purpose. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4742.400000000001s)]
*  And then there's a naming and shaming and maybe appealing to the public through social media and [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4747.04s)]
*  saying, hey, do you want this money going here when, hey, we have tragedies in our own country [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4752.400000000001s)]
*  that need to be solved. We have healthcare, we have houses burned down, we have infrastructure. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4757.52s)]
*  And so maybe you could talk a little bit about hearts and minds and winning those [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4762.56s)]
*  and what your general take is so far. I think that we have to remember that we're [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4766.16s)]
*  only nine or 10 days into Doge. So the fact that we're already at a billion dollars a day is [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4769.12s)]
*  really incredible. And there has really been no discernible impact. There has been a lot of [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4775.44s)]
*  fissures of fake news and misinformation, but the real impacts have been negligible to none [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4782.08s)]
*  since they started making those cuts. I think that Doge is a three layer onion. So layer one is the [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4786.64s)]
*  people. We have now given a pretty generous offer to folks. And I think Elon said it, it was like [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4793.92s)]
*  basically the maximum allowed by these contracts, but they tried to do a very good thing there. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4803.04s)]
*  The second, as you guys just said, the second layer of the onion is going to be the infrastructure, [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4807.76s)]
*  all the buildings, all the physical plants that the government owns and operates that may be empty, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4813.12s)]
*  that may be idle and getting them back into private hands so that they can be repurposed, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4818.72s)]
*  that's going to save a ton of money. But both of them will pale in comparison to the third layer [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4824.400000000001s)]
*  of this onion, which is the IT and the services and the spend. And what I mean by that is when [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4830.320000000001s)]
*  you read how the department is set up at the center and nucleus of every single one of these [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4836.96s)]
*  Doge teams is an engineer. And I think the reason is that they can get into these systems of record [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4844.16s)]
*  and start to trace where the money is going. And I think when you start to uncover through forensic [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4851.04s)]
*  analysis, where these dollars are going and how it's spent, that's probably how you're going to [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4857.68s)]
*  close the gap from a trillion to, and I suspect to be honest, it could be more than $2 trillion [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4865.04s)]
*  when it's all said and done. That is an enormous amount of waste and it's unproductive. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4871.2s)]
*  So I'm very excited for what happens over this next little while. Just the transparency is [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4877.44s)]
*  going to be incredible. Guys, just for kicks, check this out, right? If we took 2019 spend, [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4881.92s)]
*  right? The year before COVID and put it up against 2024 revenues, $500 billion surplus. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4890.88s)]
*  Wow. Versus the one and a half trillion dollar deficit. So two trillion dollar swing on like [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4898.08s)]
*  four years. Yeah. On a $4 trillion budget. That's all waste. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4907.84s)]
*  Well, a lot of it's in. Remember we've got a trillion dollars a year of interest payments now. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4913.04s)]
*  I mean, this is guys, this is the thing. Like there's two deflationary things that we need. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4917.2s)]
*  One is Doge and two is where AI is going to take us if it really does its thing. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4923.52s)]
*  That will keep us in an okay spot economically, but like we got it, this spend has to go or we're [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4930.64s)]
*  in sort of like we're in Greek territory, if that makes sense. Yeah. And I think the popular support [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4935.68s)]
*  for this is pretty incredible. I'll just go through a couple of numbers with you. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4944.24s)]
*  You know, looking at what people agree with that Trump's doing early on and what they disagree [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4949.12s)]
*  with. You know, obviously we talked about it last week, Chamath pardoning the January 6th protesters [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4954.240000000001s)]
*  and, you know, ending requirements for government employees to report gifts. That's sort of like [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4961.360000000001s)]
*  the Supreme Court thing. These are tremendously unpopular. And then if you go and you look at [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4965.360000000001s)]
*  downsizing the federal government and imposing a hiring freeze and requiring all federal employees [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4970.4800000000005s)]
*  to return to an office, these are incredibly popular. And Elon tweeted these graphs out as [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4977.28s)]
*  well. So right now you have Trump at the apex of his political popularity and you have these issues [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4982.4s)]
*  specifically in a very polarized time as incredibly popular. He's also done an incredible job with the [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4989.92s)]
*  border. That's another consensus based issue. So Trump now has downsizing the government and [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=4999.2s)]
*  controlling immigration and getting rid of violent immigrants as incredibly popular parts of his [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5005.2s)]
*  mandate. And that's the big win for him. If you look at his popularity, Trump is massively more [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5010.08s)]
*  popular than he was the first time around. He's at 49% compared to last time, 44. He still looks [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5016.64s)]
*  historically least popular president ever. So my point in all of this is when you see Trump doing [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5021.6s)]
*  things like his meme coin or taking on Pete Buttigieg today, all that kind of Trump 1.0 [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5028.24s)]
*  negativity, grifting, that's the stuff that's going to derail this. But the stuff that's not [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5032.96s)]
*  going to derail it is focusing on the Trump 2.0 agenda. And that is as somebody who was a never [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5036.96s)]
*  Trump, or as you all know in the audience, and now somebody who is supporting him relentlessly, [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5042.48s)]
*  that margin, that extra 10% of people who support him right now is me and other folks who are looking [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5047.5199999999995s)]
*  at the people who are supporting him right now is me. And that's the way that Trump is going to [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5053.36s)]
*  put people around him. He has to stay with the 2.0 agenda as hard as it is and stay away from the [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5058.08s)]
*  Steve Bannon agenda and the grifting. Those are the things that will take this all apart. So that's [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5063.44s)]
*  my appeal to them. I told everybody I give a letter grade. I give them a B so far. Could do better, [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5068.08s)]
*  but pretty good. Less of the meme coin, less of the drug. You know, we have to make sure that [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5073.28s)]
*  we're not dragging dishwashers and teachers and people who've been here 20 years out of the country. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5077.92s)]
*  And it's going to be a very deaf, important approach here. If this is going to be sustained, [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5083.44s)]
*  and I think it's a coin toss, if you will be able to maintain his popularity. And what he did today [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5090.0s)]
*  with this, like, I don't know if you saw the Pete Buttigieg, he was attacking him over this [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5095.759999999999s)]
*  tragedy. That's the kind of stuff people don't want. Less of that, please. More of the doge. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5099.44s)]
*  That's my little rant. Can we talk to Travis about Waymo now? Travis, can I ask, have you taken a [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5103.919999999999s)]
*  production Waymo? Yes. What do you think about it? And do you think that's the future of [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5109.76s)]
*  transportation? And how does Uber play into the self-driving car business now? I mean, look, [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5114.16s)]
*  it's funny because as you guys know, back in the back in the day, 2015, 16, 17, we had our own [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5121.52s)]
*  autonomous vehicles out there. And I remember the first one of ours that I took. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5129.52s)]
*  And I got in the back and all I had was a stop button, a big red stop button that I could push [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5135.44s)]
*  if things got weird. And I remember this in Pittsburgh where we had our robotics division [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5141.84s)]
*  and autonomy division at Uber. And I got out of that car and literally it's like I got off a [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5147.04s)]
*  roller coaster ride. Like my legs were, I could not stand straight. Like I was like a little wobbly [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5153.52s)]
*  because I was so freaked out and the adrenaline was pumping. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5158.64s)]
*  You get in a Waymo today and it's like, you're not even thinking twice. You're just like, [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5163.200000000001s)]
*  it's all good. You just get in, you get out. Now part of it's just the normalization. It's like, [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5168.08s)]
*  it's just working and that normalizing matters in terms of the psychology around it. We're just [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5173.52s)]
*  there. So it just works. Now, is it a optimized experience for ride sharing? No. Like the cyber [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5179.92s)]
*  cab is sort of the ultra sort of destination for what it means to get transported across the city [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5186.48s)]
*  in a vehicle that is not meant for a human to drive. No steering wheel, folks potentially [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5194.16s)]
*  been facing each other, just a whole bunch of different formats. The technology works. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5200.32s)]
*  We know that there are different ways to get to the technology. I think that probably the most [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5207.04s)]
*  interesting thing that we should be, or one of the most interesting things to be thinking about, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5210.959999999999s)]
*  maybe there's a few. First is cheap AI makes cheap autonomy. Okay. So if as cheap AI gets out there [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5215.44s)]
*  and proliferates and gets broadly distributed, we should expect autonomy gets easier and easier [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5227.36s)]
*  and easier. And you see some of the stuff that's happening with Tesla and FSD, their new models are [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5231.919999999999s)]
*  like, I think in a three month period, they went up like 10X in terms of performance, meaning [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5237.28s)]
*  a number of miles per human intervention. That's the thing that Elon's seeing right now, because [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5242.4s)]
*  cheap AI, cheap good AI makes cheap good autonomy. And that's a thing we need to connect the dots on. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5249.679999999999s)]
*  I think the thing then you go one level past that you're like, okay, there's the possibility, [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5255.759999999999s)]
*  literally, that autonomy just gets easy and commoditized, similar to what's happening to AI. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5260.5599999999995s)]
*  The next part is, okay, you get the hardware. You're like, okay, manufacturing's hard. That's [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5266.08s)]
*  interesting. That could be a long pole in the tent. I think that could be a place where Tesla, [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5271.92s)]
*  of course, has huge advantage. You then look at who are Waymo's partners. Are they getting set up [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5276.48s)]
*  to do the right kind of manufacturing and get scale of cars out there? But then there's like this [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5282.8s)]
*  dark horse that nobody's talking about, which is it's called electricity. It's called power. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5288.72s)]
*  And all these vehicles are electric vehicles. And if you said, I just did some quick back of [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5297.68s)]
*  the envelope calcs. If all of the miles in California went EV ride sharing, you would need [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5303.92s)]
*  to double the energy capacity of California. Let's not even talk about what it would take [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5312.8s)]
*  to double the energy capacity in the grid and things like that in California. Let's not even [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5318.240000000001s)]
*  go there. Even getting 20% more, 10% more is going to be a gargantuan five to 10-year exercise. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5322.64s)]
*  Look, I live in LA. It's a nice area in LA. And we have power outages all the freaking time [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5332.96s)]
*  because the grid is effed up and they're upgrading it as things break. That's literally where we're [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5339.84s)]
*  at. In LA, one of the most affluent neighborhoods in LA. That's just where we are. So I think the [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5344.64s)]
*  sort of the dark horse kind of hot take is combustion engine AVs because I don't know how [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5352.32s)]
*  you can go fast getting AV out there really, really, really massive with the electric grid as it is. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5365.04s)]
*  What do you think about regulation in this regard? Because obviously there was the crews, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5373.68s)]
*  you know, a person got hit by a regular car. They dragged it. The whole thing imploded. We had at [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5378.88s)]
*  Uber the tragedy in Arizona where somebody was playing Candy Crush when they were a safety [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5385.68s)]
*  driver. You know, what is your outlook on this stuff rolls out and somebody gets hurt? And then [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5390.4800000000005s)]
*  you know, tens of thousands of cities that you brought Uber to, how receptive are they going [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5398.24s)]
*  to be towards this? And what do you think the regulatory framework will be like? [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5403.52s)]
*  You know, I think similar to how you get normalized, it's like you're used to getting in a car. It's [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5406.96s)]
*  normalized psychologically and in the sort of public sphere, the public mindset, you get used to it. So [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5411.76s)]
*  like we're getting to a place where these vehicles are provably safer than human driven vehicles. So [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5417.76s)]
*  yes, there are mistakes, but they're just provably safer and people are just getting used to it. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5424.8s)]
*  And that's a big part of the cycle. So I think we're getting at the same thing. I think we're [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5430.16s)]
*  getting out of the hysteria and we're getting into like, yeah, it's just great. Like talk to [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5436.32s)]
*  people who are using it and they feel safer from a, of course, like I feel like we're going to get [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5442.5599999999995s)]
*  in less accidents, but also I feel safer because there's like, there's less chance of like an [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5449.5199999999995s)]
*  interpersonal problem that does happen, especially, you know, late at night, you know, when people are [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5454.16s)]
*  out partying and things like this, there's just like, there is a level of safety on many different [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5460.48s)]
*  aspects for the drivers. Yeah. For the dry. No, it's for the, yeah. There's like, there's, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5466.0s)]
*  there's safety aspects across the board. Right. What do you think about BID and like you sort [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5471.84s)]
*  of mentioned everybody getting to autonomy at the same time, obviously Waymo's got the biggest lead [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5476.88s)]
*  Tesla's behind them, BID and about 10 other providers are out there doing this. Does, [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5481.84s)]
*  does, you know, do 10 players get there at the same time? And then it's just who can incorporate [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5486.48s)]
*  these into their network. And what do you think of the strategy that Uber's doing of, hey, we've [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5491.92s)]
*  got these eight partners, we'll take everybody into the network and we'll manage people vomiting [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5495.52s)]
*  the back of cars, cleaning them and charging them. So look, I think the big issue you have with [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5500.64s)]
*  anything Chinese is will you be allowed to bring it in the U S just period. Like you maybe kind of [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5505.6s)]
*  can now what happens with tariffs, will there be blocks and bringing this kind of technology into [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5512.400000000001s)]
*  the U S what happens there? I think that's a whole thing. The bet that Uber makes is that [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5516.72s)]
*  whether consciously or subconsciously that it's like, will AI, will cheap democratized AI happen? [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5521.92s)]
*  And if so, does that make cheap democratized autonomy? Then you've got to line up your [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5529.200000000001s)]
*  physical sort of hardware partners, the car manufacturers, then you've got to say, okay, [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5534.8s)]
*  is the electricity where it's at and are there other bets to make to make sure that I can charge [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5539.6s)]
*  my car. So like there is a huge real estate play here and fleet management play of like, [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5544.64s)]
*  of like, how do I electrify these plots of land known as parking lots and also set them up so [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5550.639999999999s)]
*  that robots can clean cars in sort of a very, very efficient way. There's like a whole, [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5560.32s)]
*  when we talk about- Fleet management. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5567.04s)]
*  That's super interesting, Travis. That's like, it's almost like the idea that we all talk about [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5568.32s)]
*  today is data centers and data centers need their own power substation in order to meet the power [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5572.32s)]
*  demands. But if we do see a world of robotics, automation generally, and we've got these kind of [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5576.96s)]
*  moving robotic systems in our world, they need to have a similar sort of like power demand [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5582.96s)]
*  met that probably looks like, hey, they all go into their recharge building and they get [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5589.12s)]
*  recharged whether they're a car or a humanoid robot or a food delivery robot on the sidewalk [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5593.84s)]
*  or whatever, or a drone. And they just kind of get recharged, huh? [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5598.8s)]
*  Robots need actuators. Do you know what you need for an actuator? A permanent magnet. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5602.4800000000005s)]
*  You know what you need for a permanent magnet? Rare earths. Who's the rare earth king? Ex-China. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5607.12s)]
*  Greenland. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5614.24s)]
*  It's true. Greenland, let's go. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5614.8s)]
*  So guys, I think there's a couple of interesting things. One of them is going to be, [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5619.2s)]
*  how are these companies thinking about real estate, electrifying that real estate in urban [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5625.12s)]
*  environments and roboticizing that real estate so that they can do the servicing, maintenance, [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5629.92s)]
*  et cetera? Look, I guess it could be manual for a while. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5634.96s)]
*  But hold on, can I put you on the spot? Just go one level above it because [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5637.12s)]
*  merge the last two concepts together. We talked about the federal government doge, et cetera. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5640.4800000000005s)]
*  Isn't there the potential for just a complete surplus of physical inventory that exists in [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5646.08s)]
*  America? Oh, yeah. Big time. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5652.4800000000005s)]
*  So what does that mean for commercial real estate? How do you navigate around that? Because you've [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5654.96s)]
*  got to evade the falling knives first. So okay. So let's just go down ride [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5659.44s)]
*  sharing lane. So autonomous ride sharing lane. You go down that lane, car ownership, [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5664.32s)]
*  which is already dropping, drops like a knife all the way down. And there's this thing in cities, [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5670.16s)]
*  which takes up 20 to 30% of all the land. It's called parking. It's no longer necessary because [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5676.16s)]
*  cars are getting utilized. The cars that exist on the roads are getting utilized 15X more than [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5681.12s)]
*  they were before per car. So you need, hypothetically, one 15th number of cars. Maybe you could say one [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5685.759999999999s)]
*  fifth or one 10th because you want to be able to surge to rush hour and things like that. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5693.76s)]
*  It depends on what kind of carpooling and things like this are going on. Let's just call it [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5698.4800000000005s)]
*  10X fewer cars, one 10th the land necessary for parking. At least one 10th. Maybe it's less than [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5702.96s)]
*  that. So now you're opening up 20% of the land in a city that just goes fallow. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5710.400000000001s)]
*  But what should we do with that? And is there a demand for that land? [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5720.16s)]
*  Well, look, maybe it's these... Should it be housing? And then don't we have to reevaluate [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5724.400000000001s)]
*  all of the city planning today? Because city planning today, to your point, works backwards [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5731.12s)]
*  from all these constraints that are 1.0 constraints. Here's the traffic flow. Here are the [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5734.96s)]
*  traffic patterns. Those don't exist theoretically anymore or they would exist in a totally different [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5739.76s)]
*  way, right? Yeah. There's a massive amount of creativity to say, what can I do with that land [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5744.24s)]
*  and with a high ROI? Some people are like, you're going to have farms, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5750.08s)]
*  hydroponic farms in urban environments. I'm like... [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5758.16s)]
*  But that's not a bad idea if you want to have farm to table, healthy food. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5760.64s)]
*  It's literally farm to table. It's like a mile away from you. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5765.28s)]
*  Yeah. So there's some interesting ideas. The land price has to really come crashing down [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5767.68s)]
*  and there's interesting ramifications if it were to do that. You could imagine... [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5772.24s)]
*  But that's what I wanted you to say, not to try to get you there, but... [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5775.92s)]
*  You're leading the witness. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5779.12s)]
*  Well, that seems like the crazy thing that nobody is thinking about, which is in this push, this [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5780.4s)]
*  physical built inventory has so much value built up in the 401ks of individuals to the balance [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5785.44s)]
*  sheets of huge pension funds, but that value could be very different. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5793.28s)]
*  Right. But the crazy part is, is it could just be electricity production and electric [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5797.44s)]
*  capacity on the grid could be the gating factor that makes it a slow burn. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5802.5599999999995s)]
*  Potentially. I'm just riffing here, guys. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5806.64s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5810.72s)]
*  Makes total sense. And if you want to see what happens when you have unlimited land, [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5811.6s)]
*  if you live in Austin and you see the distance between San Antonio, Houston, and Dallas, [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5816.160000000001s)]
*  and Austin in that triangle, you get 30 minutes outside of the city center. It's just unlimited [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5821.4400000000005s)]
*  land and there's less regulation. And you know what's happened? Housing prices and rents have [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5826.160000000001s)]
*  come down two or three years in a row. So this could happen in other major cities. And if Doge [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5830.0s)]
*  has less regulation, you can build more. It could be amazing for Americans to actually be able to [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5834.32s)]
*  afford homes again and maybe convert some of this space. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5839.28s)]
*  Right. You go energy storage, electric grid upgrades, sort of modular energy capacity upgrades [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5843.28s)]
*  like in production. This is going to be very, very important. Right now, if you want to, [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5852.719999999999s)]
*  and we do this all the time, we have of course facilities all over every major city [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5858.72s)]
*  in the US and really around the world. Utility upgrades is the long pole in the tent in [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5863.76s)]
*  construction development. In a lot of our cities, not all cities, but in a lot of our cities. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5871.6s)]
*  The Fed held rates. They're getting close to the goal of 2%. I guess we're at 2.4%, 2.9% [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5877.68s)]
*  in terms of inflation. Any thoughts on where we're at with the Fed deciding to not cut? [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5884.32s)]
*  You put it on the docket here, Jamath. Any wider thoughts there? [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5891.04s)]
*  I would just say that the long end of the yield curve is basically telling us that there's still [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5894.0s)]
*  a chance for inflation. So I think that the question is these next 30 or 60 days from the [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5899.36s)]
*  administration, I think are basically, they're critical. And I think if Doge gets to the 3 [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5906.24s)]
*  billion a day number quicker than people thought, there's going to be a lot of room for, [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5911.68s)]
*  I think, the president to make a very valid argument that rates are too high for where they [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5917.04s)]
*  are and that we're going to be able to have a lot more cost control in the expenses, which means [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5923.76s)]
*  that there'll be less need to spend. It doesn't solve the problem that Yellen created. Yellen [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5930.320000000001s)]
*  and Biden on the way out the door, the biggest problem was that they put America in this very [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5936.88s)]
*  difficult position because they issued so much short-term paper that is extremely expensive. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5942.32s)]
*  And as all of that rolls off, we have to go and finance a ton of this debt at now 5%. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5946.64s)]
*  Nearly 30% of the debt is going to get refinanced this year. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5955.92s)]
*  And then it's like, what are these auctions going to look like, guys? This is the thing we all got [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5960.4800000000005s)]
*  to believe. The last auction barely had 2X coverage. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5964.8s)]
*  And I think that that could take a lot of the energy out of the market. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5967.04s)]
*  Watch the Dalio interview because this is exactly the topic he covers. As we end up needing to [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5969.6s)]
*  refinance this debt, the rates climb, the appetite isn't there, and it becomes a spiral. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5974.72s)]
*  That's why we have to cut fast in terms of the deficit to basically attract the market. Now, [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5980.320000000001s)]
*  the market's moved a little bit, right? So on January 13th, the 30-year treasury peaked at [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5986.88s)]
*  exactly 5%. And it's come down today, it's at 4.77%. So a little bit of relief since that peak [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=5993.44s)]
*  is as the administration's gone into office and actually taken action. But as more of this action [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6000.879999999999s)]
*  is realized, if people do appreciate and doge it successful and the court's adjudication does [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6006.96s)]
*  allow reduction in spending, which I think is the intention, I think we could see this rate drop from [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6013.28s)]
*  478 much more significantly than where it is. And that'll create a great deal of relief. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6018.32s)]
*  And Dave, it's like, it either does that or it really, really doesn't. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6022.64s)]
*  Or it does the exact super nasty really bad. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6028.64s)]
*  That's right. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6032.72s)]
*  I got a text from someone who is pretty senior in capital markets, [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6033.120000000001s)]
*  thinks this is going to go to 5.5% before it goes down. So they think that there's going to be a [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6037.68s)]
*  little bit more of a turbulent run ahead. But the thing is, it's like that whole thing of [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6042.56s)]
*  it's going to get to 5.5% before it comes down. It spirals on itself. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6048.0s)]
*  You got to print money to then get to that place and then the printing drives it. You get to that [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6053.04s)]
*  spiral. The problem is if we go to 5.5%, that's not 80 basis points. What you really need to think [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6058.240000000001s)]
*  about is the total tonnage of actual dollars that need to get repaid back. And if you look [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6063.92s)]
*  backwards, that's effectively like 10% rates from 2000. Could you imagine what the economy [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6068.8s)]
*  that's right would have done if you had brought rates to 10, 11% 20 years ago? It would have [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6074.400000000001s)]
*  crippled the economy. So we don't have a lot of room here where you can walk rates up to 5.5%, [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6078.64s)]
*  6% without a lot of things starting to break. This is why I actually think Doge will be successful [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6084.320000000001s)]
*  because as people internalize all of these things where every single congressperson, [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6089.68s)]
*  Freeberg that may have wanted their own benefit for their community, they'll have to take a step [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6095.6s)]
*  back because the broader optimization for America just needs to take priority. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6100.4800000000005s)]
*  Shamath, it just doesn't work like that, man. I agree with the notion, but I just don't believe [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6104.72s)]
*  that any individual congressperson will take responsibility in this way. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6110.400000000001s)]
*  No, they won't. They won't. But the question is, can they block it? [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6113.76s)]
*  Yeah. Or put another way, again, the executive branch can slow roll spend in a lot of different [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6116.56s)]
*  ways. Except you cannot with Medicare and social security. Discretionary spending is like 20%. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6126.64s)]
*  The mandatory spending, social security, Medicare, Medicaid, these are the larger outlay. And this [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6133.6s)]
*  where we come back to the fact that this will never get addressed until it has to be because [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6143.360000000001s)]
*  of the political suicide that arises. I just think this is where I think Elon's [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6149.92s)]
*  fame can be helpful. And I mean very specifically this following idea. That famous Sputnik comment [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6154.160000000001s)]
*  where NASA spent millions of dollars trying to engineer a pen that could write upside down, [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6160.32s)]
*  and it turned out that in Sputnik the Russians just took a pencil. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6166.0s)]
*  That is what we need to do to the US government because I suspect even though there's a lot of [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6170.88s)]
*  mandated spend, the real question that nobody knows the answer to is, is that spend useful? [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6174.88s)]
*  So even though it's appropriated by Congress, there has to be a feedback loop that says, [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6180.4s)]
*  you can just use a pencil. You don't need the upside down writing pen. And I think that if [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6185.92s)]
*  there's anybody that can broadcast that to the world, it's him. And this is where I think Trump [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6190.16s)]
*  gets enormous leverage by having Elon in the West Wing. But nobody else could give him. The rest of [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6195.5199999999995s)]
*  us would just be chirping into the darkness. Yeah. This is the naming and shaming of government [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6200.48s)]
*  waste that's actually going to work. And the Doge account on Twitter is doing it. They're basically [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6204.72s)]
*  saying, hey, we're giving foreign aid for this project, for that project. Is it going to be [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6209.5199999999995s)]
*  perfect every time? No. But you show an empty office space. You show people not coming to work. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6212.88s)]
*  Show people wasting money. Well, yeah. If that's even real, there's going to be a bunch of [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6217.84s)]
*  back and forth here. But overall, if you keep naming and shaming each of these projects, [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6223.6s)]
*  and then they were talking about blockchain, whatever, and supposed as a report, [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6228.08s)]
*  Elon is at the government building working on leases at the moment. This stuff is going to be [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6231.6s)]
*  extraordinarily popular because you can just take the number of 330 million Americans and whatever [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6237.84s)]
*  you just save, you can just divide it by that number and tell every American how much they [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6243.68s)]
*  just paid less in taxes or how much they just saved individually. The naming, shaming, and [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6248.56s)]
*  doing the back of the envelope math for every American is going to work. Do we want to wrap [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6253.6s)]
*  maybe a little bit on this tragedy in DC? Okay. What are your thoughts? We were talking with our [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6257.76s)]
*  friend, Sky Dayton, who is very involved in aviation, and he's got a lot of blog posts [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6262.72s)]
*  he's done recently, and he's got a company he invested in to do pilot training. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6268.08s)]
*  I'll share two things. One is anonymous. It's from a friend of mine gave it to me and said I [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6273.28s)]
*  could share it. This is a commercial pilot, and I posted this. I'll just read it. Honestly, [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6278.24s)]
*  DCA is the sketchiest airport we fly into. I feel like the controllers there play fast and loose, [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6284.72s)]
*  hence the periodic runway incursions. I've said to every first officer in my threat briefings [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6290.32s)]
*  that we both need to be on red alert at all times there. DCA calls out helo traffic, [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6295.36s)]
*  helicopter traffic, and vice versa all the time, but it's borderline impossible to see them when [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6300.5599999999995s)]
*  you're bombing along at 150 miles per hour. I mean, that's from a pilot that is not, I don't [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6305.599999999999s)]
*  think he has any incentive to sugarcoat things. And then I just wanted to read a message from [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6311.2s)]
*  Brian Utko, who's the CEO of WISC, who's building a lot of these autonomous systems. He said, first, [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6315.599999999999s)]
*  auto traffic collision avoidance systems do exist. Right now, these aircraft will not take [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6323.76s)]
*  control from the pilot to save the aircraft, even if software and systems on the aircraft [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6330.320000000001s)]
*  know that it's going to collide. That's the bit flip that needs to happen in aviation. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6337.12s)]
*  Automation can actually kick in and take over even in piloted aircraft to prevent a crash. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6342.88s)]
*  That's the minimum of where we need to go. Some fighter jets have something called automatic [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6350.08s)]
*  ground collision avoidance systems that do exactly this when fighter pilots pass out, [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6354.96s)]
*  and it's possible for commercial. And then the second, he said, is we need to have better ATC, [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6360.0s)]
*  air traffic control, software and automation. Right now, we use VHF radio communications for safety [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6364.639999999999s)]
*  and for critical instructions. And that's kind of insane. We should be using data links, etc. The [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6372.96s)]
*  whole ATC system runs on 1960s technology. They deserve better software and automation [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6378.96s)]
*  in the control towers. It's totally ripe for change. The problem is that attempts at reform [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6384.88s)]
*  have failed. So I just wanted you guys to have that one from this commercial pilot and then two [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6390.72s)]
*  from Brian Utko, who I think understands this issue really well. There's so much opportunity [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6396.72s)]
*  here to make this better. This should have never happened. Our other friends, Guy Dayton, [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6400.64s)]
*  has been pushing really hard for the US government to do advanced pilot training. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6404.64s)]
*  One of the things that he says constantly is just that a lot of the pushback is just [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6409.68s)]
*  union rhetoric around what they perceive the right thing for their constituency is. And hopefully, [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6413.6s)]
*  this starts this conversation because I think guys like Sky, guys like Brian are working on [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6420.72s)]
*  this next level of autonomous solution that can just make flying totally, totally safe beyond [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6426.4800000000005s)]
*  what it was. The crazy stat is that we haven't had a commercial airline disaster in the United [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6432.48s)]
*  States in almost 25 years. Isn't that incredible? I think it was 15, yeah. It's looking like pilot [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6436.719999999999s)]
*  error here. And there also seems to be some question of why these Apaches are flying around [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6441.679999999999s)]
*  this really crowded airspace. And it seems like they're shuttling politicians around. And maybe [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6446.879999999999s)]
*  that's not the best idea in this really dense area, as your pilot friend was referring to, Chamath. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6452.4s)]
*  So, God, thoughts and prayers and all that stuff for the families of the people who died. It's just [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6459.2s)]
*  terrible tragedy. Terrible tragedy. Yeah. This is an area to invest money and use the private sector [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6464.879999999999s)]
*  and all this incredible innovation that's available to upgrade these systems and infrastructure. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6473.28s)]
*  This has been another amazing episode of the All In Podcast. Thanks, Travis, for joining us. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6478.24s)]
*  Thank you, TK. Thanks to the Czar for coming in. That was a lot of fun, guys. First time. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6481.839999999999s)]
*  It's my first time on a podcast ever. Yes. You were great. You were great. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6485.04s)]
*  Come back any time. You were great, man. You were great. Appreciate it. Appreciate it. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6489.36s)]
*  Very based. It's just going to like it. Tell us what you think. And we'll see you all next time. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6492.88s)]
*  We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just like [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6514.88s)]
*  this like sexual tension, but they just need to release it. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RkgkOqWs0s&t=6534.72s)]
