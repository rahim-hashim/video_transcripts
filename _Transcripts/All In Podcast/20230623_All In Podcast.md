**All In Podcast:** [June 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8)
*  So wait a second, you guys I saw that you were at a CO2 conference or a TPG conference or at some [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=0.0s)]
*  banking conference, sacks, right? And I were both at the CO2 summit CO2 CO2 is a large investor is [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=7.36s)]
*  in a hedge fund private equity, their late stage fund. It's big, late stage fund summits, a really [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=14.4s)]
*  big word. Was it a summit? Or is it more like a meeting? Well, it's like a two day conference [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=19.28s)]
*  in Santa Barbara. Oh, nice. They've done a number of years in a row now. Last year, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Brian and I went and we met with SPF. They were telling you that SPF story. No, let's go. Who's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  got crazier hair? You or SPF? Give us a quick take that hat off for a second. Take that moncler off [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=38.64s)]
*  for a second. Let's get a side by side. Oh, my god. Sacks is using no product. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  It's not that bad. It's not that bad. You're starting to look like the emperor, like Senator [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  Palpatine from Star Wars. I mean, people are having a field day with this crazy hair. But what was [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=55.68s)]
*  the vibe? If you said there was a vibe two years ago, the vibe was crypto mania. SPF was the bell [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=61.04s)]
*  of the ball. I suppose he'll be the bell of the ball when he goes in the Husqvall as well. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=66.96s)]
*  No, it looks like he's getting off. He's getting up. I thought he was getting off. I guess it's the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=72.32s)]
*  fix in is the fixes in. Oh, God. I mean, if he gets off, I agree. Can you imagine if he gets off? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=75.84s)]
*  He's almost as protected as Hunter Biden. Here we go. Okay, everybody. Freeberg's not here this week. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=82.56s)]
*  Insert jokes and conspiracy theories for the mids. There's going to be about 8000 messages on a [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  subreddit about Freeberg missing this week and Sacks missing last week. I'll let you guys all [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=95.12s)]
*  read into it. But what would you say Brad? Brad Gershner back, of course, fifth bestie. Brad, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=99.68s)]
*  what would you say the vibe was at this one? If it was SPF lunacy two years ago, what was the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=104.24s)]
*  vibe this year? Well, you know, first, they put on an incredible event called East meets West. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=109.52s)]
*  And it was really about bringing, you know, CEOs and founders from China [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=115.28s)]
*  to the States and connecting them with founders and CEOs in the United States. Listen, I think [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=120.08s)]
*  it's somber, right? There's a recognition that we've seen a bounce in the public markets, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=125.91999999999999s)]
*  you know, off of this devastation in 2022. But I think, listen, they gave a great tough love speech [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=131.52s)]
*  discussion with the 1400 unicorns that are out there. And they said, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=140.4s)]
*  do not expect your unprofitable tech company to bounce like one of the Magnificent Seven, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=145.04s)]
*  right? Those are highly profitable companies traded 1920 times earnings. And if you are burning cash [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  today, there you can't come back to the well. So you need to either figure out how to get profitable, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=157.12s)]
*  figure out how to get fit. Or you need to sell your business. Because you know, there's not an [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  endless stream of money. So I thought it was a sober view, you know, Larry Summers was there. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=170.4s)]
*  And I think a lot of the people called 22, right? We're looking for a hard landing in Q1 of this [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=175.6s)]
*  year, probably including, you know, Larry was probably more in that camp. And I think everybody [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=181.52s)]
*  still views this distribution of probabilities over the course of the next four quarters. And, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=188.72s)]
*  you know, whether it's Druckenmiller, Sternlick this morning on CNBC, or whether it's Larry Summers, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  they're all saying, well, we could 30% chance of a hard landing Q4, Q1. So I would say it was so. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I could tell it was sober, Zach. Go ahead. You want to say something? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=203.36s)]
*  Well, I would say last year, it was somber in a different way. Because you got to remember in the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  first half of 2022, you had this huge decline in the markets around growth stocks, because [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=210.8s)]
*  interest rates had started going up, we had the whole regime change. But I don't think founders [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=215.28s)]
*  had internalized the way that it applied to them. And then the thing that has happened over the past [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=219.44s)]
*  year is that sales have been hit, you know, every software company I know is re forecasting down. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=225.12s)]
*  It's so much hard to grow customers are consolidating vendors, sharpening their pencils, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=233.28s)]
*  seed expansion has been replaced with seed contraction. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=239.04s)]
*  So negotiations are hard, right? Yeah. So it's much harder now to sell software than it was, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  let's say, a year ago. You know, two X is now the new three X. If you can grow two X in this [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=247.28s)]
*  environment, it's basically as good as growing three X before. It's funny to me that how much [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=252.72s)]
*  the feds actions impact buying behavior. That's the thing that I understand. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=257.44s)]
*  Psychology is distinctly different. Yeah. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=263.76s)]
*  Psychology really is different. Yeah. I mean, we knew that the feds behavior influence valuations [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=266.08000000000004s)]
*  and sort of capital markets, but the way that it influences the business outlook and how willing [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  companies are to spend money and KOTU is no different. I see they hired Billy McFarland [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  from fire festival to do the food. What is this? I mean, KOTU should be ashamed of themselves. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=281.36s)]
*  Look at this focaccia, some vegetable soup with the broth drained out super-steamy measures. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  So wrong. That is so wrong. Look at this. I mean, it looks like a dog went to the bathroom. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=295.28s)]
*  Brad and I opened our lunchbox and we're like, let's let's go somewhere else. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=300.08s)]
*  We don't go to on a budget. Wow. Look, a surprise that someone to put a surprise in our [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=303.76s)]
*  it looks like Friedberg's dog. Surprise in the KOTU lunchbox. Wow. Well, listen, it's good. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  KOTU LP should be very happy looking at that $7 lunch that they put out there. I mean, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=316.88s)]
*  Brad, should we tell the SPF story from last year's summit? I mean, last year we talked about the, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=322.71999999999997s)]
*  maybe founders hadn't internalized it yet, but the markets had corrected. But the one founder who was [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=327.68s)]
*  super bullish and optimistic and talking about how he was spraying money all over the place and he [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=331.84s)]
*  was acquiring companies and who was followed around by minions and had everyone like a beehive [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=337.84s)]
*  surrounding him and trying to talk to him was SPF. And so I remember, yeah. So I remember thinking [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=344.64s)]
*  who's going to be this year's SPF. You know, somebody here is way too optimistic. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=352.16s)]
*  Sam Altman there. So basically the KOTU conference went from bullshit to dog shit. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=358.16s)]
*  Look at Brad is so uncomfortable. Brad's like, I like this invite. I got a good invite. Chamath [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=368.48s)]
*  and I are invited to nothing. We give no shits about KOTU or their budget. They do put on a [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=374.88s)]
*  really good event. And I think that the message they gave to founders this year and last year [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=380.72s)]
*  was great. It was actually really appropriate. Whether founders choose to listen is a different [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=387.36s)]
*  story, but the message they've been conveying is similar to the message we've been conveying for [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=391.12s)]
*  the last year and a half. Hey Chamath, any more jokes we can make about KOTU since you and I get [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  invited to nothing? No, I mean, I'm not making fun of KOTU. I was just making fun of the fact [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=400.0s)]
*  that we went from literally bullshit with SPF to what looks like dog shit. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=404.88000000000005s)]
*  By the way, I bet they would invite you if you wanted to go. I'm pretty sure they would send [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=411.6s)]
*  10 invitations if I even fainted desire to go. But I'm in Milan right now. The pod's very popular [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  there, by the way. Tell everybody, can we play the focus group? Or was that? I think we can play. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=423.68s)]
*  Well, just a fan. A fan came up to me. I mean, when I say fan, this is like a very high profile [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=429.68s)]
*  person. This woman works at Netflix. She works at Netflix and her husband is the founder of a [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=434.72s)]
*  startup. She says she's a fan of the pod. So I started asking her questions about it. The focus [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=440.4s)]
*  group, because you know, we've been having this debate over the last couple of weeks about what [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=444.4s)]
*  issues we should be talking about. And certain people on the pod never want to discuss politics. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=448.79999999999995s)]
*  It's not like I only want to discuss politics. I just don't want to exclude it. I think we should [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=454.96s)]
*  just be talking about whatever the biggest issues are in the world in any given week, current events, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=459.91999999999996s)]
*  whether it's business markets or politics. And she confirmed that was basically right. Don't change [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=464.79999999999995s)]
*  it. So I don't know why we would want to change the formula for the pod at this point. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=470.16s)]
*  Every week, Zach's, there's a group of people who are like, stop talking about politics. And then [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=474.40000000000003s)]
*  there's another group of people and their feedback is, why didn't you talk about 100 Biden, Ukraine, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=478.8s)]
*  Ukraine, Putin, China, whatever. And so the docket is the docket, just to let the audience know, not [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=483.52000000000004s)]
*  that it's like all that big of a deal, it should be fairly obvious, everybody has equal input on [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=490.88s)]
*  the docket. So it's not like anybody owns the docket. If you want to talk about something, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=496.32s)]
*  you talk about something. But some people want to not talk about politics. Some people want to talk [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=500.56s)]
*  about a lot of politics. The Magnificent Seven for those people who didn't catch the reference, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=503.68s)]
*  is I think something Kramer's been talking about on CNBC. Seven stocks make up the most most of [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  the gains this year, Meta, Tesla, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Apple. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=514.8s)]
*  Can I tell you guys my welcome back to Milan story? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=519.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah, absolutely. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=522.96s)]
*  So I'm back in Milan for the summer. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=524.8s)]
*  On his throne. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=526.3199999999999s)]
*  So chef Stefano, and if you could say hi to [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=527.04s)]
*  Stefanoia, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=530.7199999999999s)]
*  all my friends, butlers, everybody. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=531.52s)]

*  I'm working from my office here. But this morning, I went to Coppola, which is my [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=537.04s)]
*  stylist, my hairdresser. And the thing is, there's like a hierarchy in the hairdressers. And so [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=541.76s)]
*  Roberto, this guy Roberto, he's like the sort of top of the ticket. And Nat has first dibs with [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=547.68s)]
*  Roberto. And I have this other guy who's excellent. His name is Joaquino. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=552.64s)]
*  Yes, you guys will see Joaquino in a few weeks. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  Anyways, the best thing about the haircuts at this place Coppola is you get a hair fluffer, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=558.08s)]
*  which means that as Joaquino Roberto cuts your hair, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=563.6s)]
*  a guy comes and he just like he like does this and then he like [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=567.6s)]
*  you're patting your hair in a very [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=572.48s)]
*  heat he fluffs your hair. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=574.56s)]
*  He's a very uncomfortable. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=575.76s)]
*  That doesn't exist anywhere that will never get disrupted by AI. And it's incredible. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=579.5999999999999s)]
*  A hair styling fluffer. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=586.4799999999999s)]
*  The hair fluffer gets like a 50 euro tip doesn't matter what he does. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=588.9599999999999s)]
*  Wow, when Saks rolls in, you're going to need two fluffers with that hair. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=594.0s)]
*  You're gonna need one on each side. I mean, the tufts are getting crazy. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=597.3599999999999s)]
*  Saks, tell me if you want Joaquino to cut your hair because when you come because [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=600.56s)]
*  he will do it, he'll do an incredible job. And I'll ask him to bring the hair fluffer. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=604.0799999999999s)]
*  All right, listen, I think we just going back to the Kochu thing. I know we're in a high interest [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=607.92s)]
*  rate lunch environment. The Herp environment is hard right now for everybody, but we did get the [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=612.24s)]
*  feedback. Let's play the feedback. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=617.36s)]
*  Hey guys, I'm at the Kochu summit and just met a fan here who wants to explain the magic of the [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=619.6800000000001s)]
*  pod because you guys keep wanting to change things and mess things up. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=626.08s)]
*  So my husband and I were listening to your podcast, pretty much religiously. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=630.16s)]
*  And there is this incredible magic that the four of you have the repartee back and forth. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=636.4s)]
*  It's super informative, the girls sort of rooting for characters almost. So it's almost like a [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=641.52s)]
*  scripted show in some ways. So I have my favorite character, my husband has his favorite character. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=644.9599999999999s)]
*  I won't say who's who, but I want you all to stay together and keep doing the show. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=649.12s)]
*  But it's fantastic and we love it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=653.36s)]
*  And you work at Netflix, right? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=656.56s)]
*  I work at Netflix back in the day. I produce shows. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=657.92s)]
*  So pick up the show. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=660.0799999999999s)]
*  I was just telling David, trying to get that magic. You can put any number of scripts together. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=660.8s)]
*  But once you get the cast on the floor and actually start getting that chemistry going, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=664.56s)]
*  that's when the magic happens and you guys kind of just nailed it. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=669.04s)]
*  All right. So that's a professional right there. So stop screwing with the formula. Stop protesting. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=673.1199999999999s)]
*  The camera really does add 10 pounds, doesn't it? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=683.76s)]
*  I take two things away from this, Chamath. Number one, she's much more charismatic on [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=686.0799999999999s)]
*  camera than Sax. She stole the show. She's delightful. And then two, that sweater. Oh, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=690.48s)]
*  my Lord. What's the brand? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=695.52s)]
*  The sweater's fantastic. No, the sweater's fantastic. The shirt's fantastic. I just think [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=697.12s)]
*  they may not have been, I don't think the intention was to mesh the two together, but- [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=700.64s)]
*  They're out in the world with each other? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=705.2s)]
*  Too many buttons for you, Chamath? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=706.16s)]
*  No, bro. It's like when you have a cream colored sweater, you can't wear a red checkered shirt. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=707.76s)]
*  It's just not. Yeah. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=712.0s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=713.76s)]
*  Red striped. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=714.8000000000001s)]
*  Anyways, it's a, I mean, it looks like you're wearing an Italian tablecloth under there from [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=715.6s)]
*  a pizzeria combined with like an $8,000 sweater. I agree. But the hair, I mean, the hair's out of [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=721.0400000000001s)]
*  control. I think the hair is fantastic. I do. Don't, don't- [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=726.64s)]
*  You can't cut the hair. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=729.6800000000001s)]
*  Do not cut the hair. Don't let your keynote touch your hair, bro. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=731.12s)]
*  I'll just get it fluffed. I'll tell them, just fluff it. Don't cut it. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=734.08s)]
*  Just fluff it. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=736.96s)]
*  Just fluff it. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=737.9200000000001s)]
*  Let's talk about the Zuck-Elon cage match. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=745.6s)]
*  Oh yeah. Oh my God. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=758.64s)]
*  This is- [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=760.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm a little worried for my friend here. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=761.28s)]
*  Yeah. Zuck looks like he's- [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=763.36s)]
*  I don't know if Elon is completely up to date on what kind of shape Zuck is in. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=764.5600000000001s)]
*  Zuck is in tremendous shape. He's got like a dojo at his house. He's been getting training [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=769.36s)]
*  in mixed martial arts from- [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=774.56s)]
*  Jiu-Jitsu. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=776.9599999999999s)]
*  The Gracies or whoever, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. He's been competing in events. Zuck is in tremendous [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=777.4399999999999s)]
*  shape and- [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=783.5999999999999s)]
*  No joke here. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=785.1999999999999s)]
*  Now, Elon's a big guy. Elon's a monster, but- [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=786.2399999999999s)]
*  I mean, Elon's not- [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=789.04s)]
*  I don't think Elon's not in this kind of shape. You don't have time to work out like this. I hope [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=789.8399999999999s)]
*  you get some sort of Gracie on your team to train you up for this thing. Also, Elon has a neck [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=794.8s)]
*  injury that he got from that sumo thing years ago. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=800.96s)]
*  And he's had to have surgeries on it, so it would really suck if that would get [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=806.08s)]
*  re-triggered. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=809.76s)]
*  Here's the thing though. He did take on a sumo wrestler. We were there for that at his [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=810.64s)]
*  birthday party and he held his own against the giant sumo wrestler. If [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=814.72s)]
*  Elon does get on top of and do the war on top of Zuck, Zuck has no chance. He will get warred. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=820.0s)]
*  So, you're telling me what he should do is [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=826.64s)]
*  abandon the mission to Mars. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=832.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=834.8000000000001s)]
*  Stop electrifying the world. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=835.9200000000001s)]
*  Totally. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=838.32s)]
*  And stop free internet around the world. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=838.8000000000001s)]
*  So he can beat up Zuck. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=842.08s)]
*  I mean, if you were to put that to a vote, I think most people would put beating up Zuck as number [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=844.64s)]
*  one. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=849.6800000000001s)]
*  This is the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard in my life. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=851.12s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=854.24s)]
*  I love the banter between the two of them. And let's just say we can all agree out of all the [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=855.04s)]
*  companies, right? There's only one contender to Zuck getting fit, right? Getting that company fit, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=860.0s)]
*  getting himself fit is Elon. 75, 80% of the people gone and product velocity is on fire at Twitter. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=866.4s)]
*  So this would be a cage match between the two who have defined this era of getting fit. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=874.48s)]
*  All right. Let's get to the docket here. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=881.92s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? He's using the fitness. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=884.16s)]
*  The guy burned a quarter trillion dollars and then found a way to stop it. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=887.52s)]
*  That's very different than firing on all cylinders in three companies. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=893.44s)]
*  I didn't say he was firing on all cylinders. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=897.76s)]
*  By the way, I am the only one of anybody I think that knows them both well. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=899.28s)]
*  Maybe Sax. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=903.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, it's kind of like, you know, if you've got like a faucet running, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=904.64s)]
*  and it's spilling over the sink and then you turn it off, that doesn't make you a firefighter. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=907.76s)]
*  It doesn't make you a plumber. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=914.32s)]
*  You know, there's a feature of a bathtub. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=916.72s)]
*  It stops spending money on. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=918.8000000000001s)]
*  There's this feature of a bathtub where when you get into it and the water gushes so violently [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=920.8000000000001s)]
*  over the outside of it, and then there's a drain at the top as well as the bottom. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=926.08s)]
*  And so then eventually it just stops. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=930.24s)]
*  Yes. You could unclog the drain. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=932.16s)]
*  But Chamathre is a good point, which is, look, Elon's a big guy. If he got training in MMA, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=934.64s)]
*  I'm sure he'd do fine. But we don't want Elon spending two hours a day for the next six months [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=940.08s)]
*  or whatever because that's been doing MMA, I guess, for a while. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=944.96s)]
*  A couple of years. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=947.9200000000001s)]
*  Maybe years. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=948.32s)]
*  He's into it. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=949.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=949.6800000000001s)]
*  All right. Well, listen, there's been some updates. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=949.84s)]
*  This war between Russia and the Ukraine or the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=953.0400000000001s)]
*  You wrote a piece about it in what was it? The Federalist, I think this week, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=960.4000000000001s)]
*  titled The Truth About Ukraine's Falling Counteroffensive and the Peace That Could Have Been. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=963.92s)]
*  Why don't you give us an overview of what you wrote and what your take is on the state of affairs right now? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=972.24s)]
*  Well, the thing that's been going on since around June 4th or June 5th is this long-awaited [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=977.04s)]
*  Ukrainian counteroffensive. This has been touted for a long time as it's going to [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=981.76s)]
*  reverse Russian territorial gains. Ukraine's going to use all of this modern Western equipment, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=986.88s)]
*  these Leopard tanks that have come from Germany and Bradleys from the United States and a lot of [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=992.9599999999999s)]
*  other NATO or American equipment, and they're going to push Russia out of their country. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=999.04s)]
*  This has been told to us since the fall of last year since that sort of Kharkiv counteroffensive [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1004.24s)]
*  produced some Ukrainian territorial gains. You've had former generals like Ben Hodges and [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1012.4s)]
*  Petraeus say that this counteroffensive is going to be highly successful. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1018.3199999999999s)]
*  Where it stands right now is that around 18 or 19 days into it, it has produced [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1022.56s)]
*  minimal gains. In fact, it's been somewhat of a disaster. It's hard to get conclusive estimates [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1027.36s)]
*  of personnel and material losses, but I think as many as a quarter of the tanks and armored vehicles [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1035.84s)]
*  have already been destroyed. The casualties may be as high as around 10,000 out of an army that was [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1044.32s)]
*  trained up for this purpose of around 50,000. So far, it has not gone well. The Ukrainian [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1050.72s)]
*  army hasn't even made it to the first line of defense. What the Russians did is they created [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1057.6000000000001s)]
*  three fortified lines or belts of defense. Then in front of that is what they call a gray zone or [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1064.72s)]
*  security zone or crumple zone, which is an area they can test, but it's not technically a fortified [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1071.68s)]
*  line. The Ukrainians are still in that sort of gray zone. They are not punching through. They [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1076.64s)]
*  are not even at the first Russian fortified line. To give you some idea of what's involved here, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1082.16s)]
*  the Russians have these obstacles. There's basically trenches that have been dug. There's [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1088.0800000000002s)]
*  ditches that would stop tanks or sort of force them to go in a certain direction, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1093.76s)]
*  steer the traffic. There's extensive minefields. They've got these things called dragon teeth, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1098.72s)]
*  which are concrete bollards that stop tanks or move them in a certain direction. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1104.08s)]
*  Then the Russians have massive amounts of artillery. They've got infantry on the ground [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1109.4399999999998s)]
*  that helps spot the artillery. If all of that doesn't take out these Ukrainian tanks, they've [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1113.28s)]
*  got these attack helicopters that come in, almost uncontested, because at this point, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1120.08s)]
*  it doesn't look like the Ukrainians have any air defense. They've also got fixed-wing aircraft that [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1125.1999999999998s)]
*  are capable of dropping precision munitions. It really seems like the Russians have fixed a [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1130.16s)]
*  lot of the problems that they had last fall in their army. So far, it seems like this [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1136.72s)]
*  counteroffensive is not going anywhere. We're 16 months into this, Chamath, and clearly, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1142.0800000000002s)]
*  fatigue is setting in. It's not commanding the news cycle here in America. On a percentage basis, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1148.24s)]
*  even the neocons and Republicans are dropping their support for this at a pretty precipitous [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1154.64s)]
*  rate, which is predictable. Americans don't want to be in forever wars. We all know that. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1161.92s)]
*  So what's your take on how this winds up, especially in relation to, A, our budget and, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1168.16s)]
*  B, this upcoming election, which this seems to be, will be a major issue if this isn't resolved [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1175.2800000000002s)]
*  by the time we get into the 24-election cycle? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1181.44s)]
*  As part of answering this, I have a question for Sax, but is it true that there was a ceasefire? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1183.8400000000001s)]
*  Putin had a press conference where he showed a document that he said was a ceasefire that then [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1188.88s)]
*  the United States apparently sent Boris Johnson over to Russia, Ukraine, to basically blow up the [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1195.28s)]
*  agreement? Is that true? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1201.2s)]
*  Yes, this is true. Yes, this is finally correct. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1202.3200000000002s)]
*  This wasn't a ceasefire. This was a peace deal before the war started, correct? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1204.24s)]
*  No, it was after. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1208.64s)]
*  Or this is what they claim? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1209.1200000000001s)]
*  There were rounds of negotiation before the war. Notably, there was a round of diplomacy [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1210.32s)]
*  between Blinken and Lavrov in January, the month before the war, where Blinken said that we cannot [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1216.48s)]
*  compromise on NATO's open door policy, that that sort of diplomacy fell apart. But then after the [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1221.6799999999998s)]
*  war, there was a meeting of the Russian delegation and Ukrainian delegation in Istanbul under the [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1226.72s)]
*  supervision of Erdogan in Turkey. Naftali Bennett also had a similar process. In both cases, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1234.0s)]
*  the West rejected a peace deal. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1240.56s)]
*  Allegedly. This is Putin we're talking about, right? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1243.04s)]
*  Well, hold on a second. Let me come back to the evidence for in a second. But what the deal would [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1245.68s)]
*  have provided is that the Russians would move back to pre-war lines if the Ukrainians would agree [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1250.56s)]
*  not to become a member of NATO. However, the Ukrainians could still receive specified [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1257.52s)]
*  security guarantees from the West. That was the deal. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1262.8s)]
*  Allegedly. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1265.9199999999998s)]
*  Well, we have now multiple data points. You've got Naftali Bennett saying that he thought a deal was [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1267.68s)]
*  taken on these lines, but it was rejected by the West. You also have now Putin showing the very [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1272.56s)]
*  document, which was signed by the Ukrainian delegation. So this was the document. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1277.84s)]
*  He flashed the document, right? Nobody has this document. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1282.48s)]
*  It hasn't been released yet. I hope the Russian government releases it for the purpose of history [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1284.72s)]
*  so we can inspect it. But nobody contests that this document is real. Remember, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1289.28s)]
*  if he's just making this up, you would think that Erdogan would basically come forward and say, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1293.52s)]
*  no, this is fake. There's too many people who are in that room who'd be able to say this document [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1297.68s)]
*  is fake. No one has done that. So I think there's every reason to believe this document is real. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1301.6s)]
*  Now, it is not a final agreement. It appears to be a preliminary agreement or an outline. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1305.6s)]
*  But the outline is that Russia is saying we will move back to pre-war lines if you agree not to [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1310.56s)]
*  become part of NATO. And that deal was rejected when Boris Johnson flew into Kiev and basically [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1315.84s)]
*  told the Ukrainians, we do not want to make a deal with Putin. We want to pressure Putin. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1322.48s)]
*  And the source for that is not the Russians. The source for that is a Ukrainian publication [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1326.8s)]
*  called Ukrainian Pravda, UP. And they ran an article in May of 2022 that I can put on the [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1333.4399999999998s)]
*  screen. And it is the source for saying that Boris Johnson came in and told Zelensky, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1340.64s)]
*  we do not want to make a peace deal. We, the West, are not ready to make a deal with Putin. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1346.48s)]
*  We want you to fight Putin or pressure Putin. And if you do, we will give you advanced weapon [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1351.2s)]
*  systems. And that is when the deal fell apart. If you look at the timing of it. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1355.68s)]
*  Yes, allegedly. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1359.3600000000001s)]
*  This is this happened on- [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1359.8400000000001s)]
*  No, no, this has been lightly sourced here. So let's just be clear. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1360.96s)]
*  No, no, no. But you have to consider the source here. This is a pro-Ukrainian publication [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1363.76s)]
*  writing in May of 2022. Now, the tone of the article and what they basically say in this [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1368.72s)]
*  article is that Zelensky accepted Boris Johnson's offer. In other words, he took the gamble. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1374.4s)]
*  And at this point in time, you've got to remember, this is two months after the war started, it looked [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1380.08s)]
*  like the Ukrainians were doing well. So UP was essentially praising Zelensky in this article [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1383.6000000000001s)]
*  for taking the West up on this deal to pressure Putin rather than make peace. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1389.44s)]
*  Now, a year later, it looks like this gamble was a disaster. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1394.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1398.72s)]
*  And so that is the real conclusion here. A deal was available, but the West chose not to take it. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1399.1999999999998s)]
*  By the way, Fiona Hill, who is a Russia hawk, and you could almost put her, I'd say, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1404.72s)]
*  neocon adjacent has basically said that this type of deal was available. The West did not want this [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1412.48s)]
*  deal. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1418.08s)]
*  I think Jason, maybe to give you an answer, my thought is that this week was a very bad week. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1418.56s)]
*  For establishment politics and institutions. Because on the one hand, if you take the Russia [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1423.84s)]
*  incident and the Ukraine war, what you saw was that there were ample numbers of off ramps that [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1429.84s)]
*  we chose, frankly, to not take so that we could engage our enemy in some long drawn out war on [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1436.72s)]
*  the hopes that it just depletes their resources. That's kind of rolling the dice, I think, in a [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1443.4399999999998s)]
*  very dangerous way. I think this week, we also saw some published stuff on COVID and the COVID [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1450.72s)]
*  vaccine, which also debunked a lot of widely held truths. And it turned out that folks that [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1457.28s)]
*  may have been conspiracy theorists, quote unquote, were right there as well. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1463.28s)]
*  So I think it's just an uncomfortable set of facts that, again, just reinforce that if you're [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1468.0s)]
*  not really thinking for yourself, you're not going to see the totality of what's actually going on. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1472.96s)]
*  I think with respect to Russia, Ukraine, everybody has moved on. And so sadly, the only people that [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1476.64s)]
*  are left over are the people that have to fight the war were still separated from their families, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1484.72s)]
*  there's the people that are dying. There was an article, I think today, they recruit prisoners, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1491.2s)]
*  right? So obviously, some of the prisoners that Russia uses are still pretty crazy. That person [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1496.3200000000002s)]
*  went on some rampage inside of a train, killed a couple people, stabbed some other people, there [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1500.3200000000002s)]
*  was just pictures of blood everywhere. I mean, this is just a horrible situation. And it's still [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1506.16s)]
*  not clear to me why we didn't take the offering. If in fact, it's real. So I just want to keep [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1511.8400000000001s)]
*  putting that disclaimer out there because Putin flashing a document doesn't make all this true. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1518.24s)]
*  It doesn't mean it's not true. What about Ukraine and Pravda? Well, Jason, I would say, what about [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1523.2s)]
*  Naftali Bennett? I am just being clear here that none of this is confirmed. How many more confirmatory [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1526.88s)]
*  data points do you need? I would say- What are you talking about? Naftali Bennett confirmed it. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1531.44s)]
*  What incentives does the Israeli former Israeli leader have to lie about this? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1535.6s)]
*  Here's what I would say, Jason, I think that something like that is so profoundly important, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1539.76s)]
*  that if it were not true, I think it would have been very important for the powers that be to [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1546.7199999999998s)]
*  discredit it almost immediately. So that they didn't have to look like they were [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1552.8799999999999s)]
*  warmongering unnecessarily. Can I also uplevel and connect to [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1559.52s)]
*  this point about the establishment? Because I think there's been a lot of pushback to even [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1563.92s)]
*  challenging the status quo, even having a conversation about Ukraine or having a [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1570.32s)]
*  conversation about COVID. And I think if there's one thing this pod represents, the fight going [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1576.4s)]
*  on at Twitter represents is the need to have this conversation. If we look at the wars the US has [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1581.68s)]
*  engaged in since September 11th, it's estimated three to four million people have died in Iraq, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1589.04s)]
*  Pakistan, Afghanistan. We spent $8 trillion dollars. Inflation adjusted, we spent $4 trillion in World [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1597.92s)]
*  War II. $8 trillion represents 25% of our entire national debt. And I've yet to meet a single parent [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1607.44s)]
*  who said to me, I care so much about this Ukraine situation, I would be willing to put my children [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1617.68s)]
*  in harm's way to fight for the defense of Europe. Okay, so those data points tell me at a very [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1624.5600000000002s)]
*  minimum, we need more of this discussion, more of this debate, not less. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1631.44s)]
*  The idea that that we could be tiptoeing closer and closer to some land war in Europe, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1636.48s)]
*  unnecessarily. And I think the bigger issue is, and you can't trust what you're being told. And [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1641.44s)]
*  I think that that's what's very probably a bigger picture. And just so we're clear here, I'm not [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1647.92s)]
*  saying I'm on either side of this. I'm just pointing out that this is all still very thinly [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1652.0s)]
*  sourced. No, it's not until the West confirms any of this, I think. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1656.88s)]
*  Expect the West to do you expect the State Department to issue a press release saying, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1661.1200000000001s)]
*  Yep, we fucked up. It's on me. My theory has been I and I've [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1664.88s)]
*  been very clear on this podcast, my theory has been since the beginning, they want to deplete [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1671.36s)]
*  Russia, and they want to deplete their army and capabilities and have regime change and Putin. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1676.08s)]
*  I'm not saying I'm for that just for the people. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1682.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm not. No, no, no, no, no. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1683.9199999999998s)]
*  You said it was ankle Putin. That was a crude language. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1685.9199999999998s)]
*  That is what they that is what they plan on doing. Yes, I think that's what they're doing. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1688.3999999999999s)]
*  And I think- [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1692.56s)]
*  Lloyd Austin, our Secretary of Defense said that our purpose was to weaken Russia. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1692.8799999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1696.8799999999999s)]
*  So to knock it out of the ranks of the great powers. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1697.04s)]
*  Yes, but I think they want regime change. Yes. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1699.44s)]
*  That's what Boris Johnson went to keep and said, we want to pressure Putin, not make a deal with [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1701.04s)]
*  him. So they courted this war they they prefer that's been to fight since the beginning, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1704.24s)]
*  they prefer to fight a proxy of choice. That was easily avoidable. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1708.72s)]
*  I'm not endorsing that. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1713.1200000000001s)]
*  Take NATO expansion off the table. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1714.48s)]
*  This is not about you, Jason. I'm asking a simple question. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1716.0s)]
*  No, no, but Sax just said it was. But Sax just said it was, so I'm just [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1718.48s)]
*  clearing it for the record. He just said that was your position and I'm correcting. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1721.2s)]
*  Okay, fair enough, Jason. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1724.72s)]
*  Have the right to correct me. That was not my position. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1725.68s)]
*  I said that's my theory. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1727.92s)]
*  I actually agree with you if you're saying that that was our government's objective, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1728.96s)]
*  which was to weaken Putin. I agree with you. They've posed to fight an optional proxy war [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1733.2s)]
*  of choice that was easily avoidable if they'd just taken NATO expansion off the table, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1739.28s)]
*  because they thought it would weaken Putin. But here's the rub on this. It has not weakened Putin. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1743.3600000000001s)]
*  It has weakened the United States and our allies. Any way you want to look at this thing, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1748.48s)]
*  look at just the weapons and munitions. So we are out of 155 millimeter artillery shells. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1752.96s)]
*  We cannot produce enough. This is the crazy thing. We spent 800 billion a year [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1760.0s)]
*  plus on the Pentagon and our national defense. We're out of ammo. I mean, we must be getting so [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1764.24s)]
*  royally ripped off by the military industrial complex. Okay, we cannot produce ammo fast enough. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1770.0s)]
*  That's why Ukraine's losing this war. The balance of artillery favors Russia. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1775.28s)]
*  Russia is basically using about 20,000 shells a day. The Ukrainians are using somewhere between [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1779.68s)]
*  three and 6,000. We are out of ammo. We cannot produce enough. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1785.1200000000001s)]
*  And this actually dovetails nicely with another story this week. There is a [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1789.04s)]
*  journalist named Matt Iglesias. Is that how you pronounce his name? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1795.1200000000001s)]
*  Matt Iglesias, yeah. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1798.72s)]
*  Iglesias. And he said, I mean, he literally said the quiet part out loud. And I'll just quote, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1799.92s)]
*  because he was criticizing you and Chamath for hosting RFK. We'll get to that in a second. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1808.0s)]
*  But he basically said, this is actually a really good idea for us. Basically, NATO equipment plus [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1814.4s)]
*  Ukrainian lives are being traded for Russian equipment and Russian lives, which leaves NATO [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1818.96s)]
*  coming out ahead. That's doubly true because NATO is much richer than Russia. So we win a long-term [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1823.6s)]
*  game of everyone explode their weapons as fast as they can make them again, though what makes that [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1829.12s)]
*  really true is NATO material is killing Russian soldiers while Russian material is killing [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1835.28s)]
*  Ukrainian soldiers. That's a deal in our favor. I mean, that is a cynical summary of that. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1839.6s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. He wrote that last year in defense of the war. Basically, like all the neocons, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1845.28s)]
*  he's sort of an establishment approved intellectual. They think he's smart. I think he's really [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1850.6399999999999s)]
*  foolish. He basically wants to fight the last Ukrainian here for the sole purpose of blowing [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1854.32s)]
*  up Russia's stockpiles. The reason this is so dumb is Russia can always make more. Those lives [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1858.6399999999999s)]
*  aren't coming back, but they can always produce more artillery, more weapons. In fact, the Russian [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1863.12s)]
*  war machine is now ramping up to full production. They are ramping up the number of people in their [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1868.2399999999998s)]
*  army. I think it's estimated that by the end of the year, they're going to have 750,000 [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1874.7199999999998s)]
*  men under arms. They've ramped up artillery shells production. They're at something like [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1878.3999999999999s)]
*  one and a half million at the beginning of the war. We were only producing 14,000 artillery shells [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1882.8s)]
*  a month, mostly for training purposes in the United States. We've since ramped that up to 20,000, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1887.9199999999998s)]
*  but that still massively trails what the Russians can do. They're trying to ramp it up to 90,000 a [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1892.88s)]
*  month, but that's going to take till 2028 because it takes time to build it. You've got to build up [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1898.48s)]
*  new factories, new production lines. You've got to issue contracts to suppliers or vendors. It takes [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1903.44s)]
*  time to do this. But the Russians basically have ramped up their war machine. Then the other thing [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1909.1200000000001s)]
*  that's happened is that Russia and China have entered a de facto alliance, including Iran. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1913.8400000000001s)]
*  So you now have the cementing of this giant alliance in Asia between China, Russia, and Iran. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1921.2800000000002s)]
*  They're sharing equipment now together. Iran is producing drones for Russia. Russia is now going [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1929.7600000000002s)]
*  to be giving advanced fighter jets to Iran. So this idea that this war has made the West stronger [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1935.6000000000001s)]
*  is depleting the West over an objective we didn't need to fight. The war was easily avoidable. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1941.2s)]
*  We have now created, I think, the most fearsome opponent that America has ever faced. We have [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1946.64s)]
*  never faced an adversary with a combined manufacturing capacity and raw materials of China, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1952.5600000000002s)]
*  Russia, and Iran. If we were to get in a war, a new world war against this sort of new axis, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1960.8000000000002s)]
*  we could lose. They actually have more manufacturing capacity to produce weapons of war [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1966.5600000000002s)]
*  and munitions and ammo than the United States does. China has been clear that they're not going [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1972.0800000000002s)]
*  to provide weapons to Russia. So I'm not sure that that alliance is exactly accurate. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1976.4s)]
*  They have given us no such assurance. All they've said is they haven't done it yet. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1983.3600000000001s)]
*  It's a theoretical thing that you're talking about here that could be very serious. I think [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1987.3600000000001s)]
*  your point, and this is to Brad's point, we should be having a very thoughtful discussion here, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1990.48s)]
*  because if China did pick Russia, which they haven't, and they went to war, it would be war [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1994.4s)]
*  with Russia. They said explicitly to us that they're not going to, but let's go to COVID. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=1998.96s)]
*  Well, we should talk about the China relationship, actually. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2002.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. Blinken just went to China, and this was the first trip for an American Secretary of [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2004.64s)]
*  State since 2018. Obviously, things have been strained with the spy balloon and the visits to [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2010.8000000000002s)]
*  Taiwan. Blinken gave some basic goals for this engagement with China, the fentanyl problem, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2018.96s)]
*  some detained Americans, and protecting US citizens working in China. Those were kind of the [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2027.6000000000001s)]
*  easy check boxes, but they wanted to create also an open line of communication between our militaries, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2032.6399999999999s)]
*  which China wasn't super stoked on or wouldn't agree to. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2040.48s)]
*  Tony did a great job. Yeah. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2045.6s)]
*  Okay. I think what's really disappointing is that while Tony's over there doing this hard work, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2047.4399999999998s)]
*  which must be tough to do because it must have been a little bit like [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2052.56s)]
*  dancing on eggshells a little bit, right? He had to be- [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2056.24s)]
*  It's intense, yeah. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2058.64s)]
*  He had to be very thoughtful, very measured. But as far as I could tell, he did a fabulous job. Now, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2059.7599999999998s)]
*  full disclosure, he's a friend of mine, so maybe I'm biased. But then over here, Biden, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2067.12s)]
*  at some mid-level fundraiser in California, is calling Xi a dictator. How hard must it be for [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2072.8799999999997s)]
*  you to try to do your job when your boss is just like completely undisciplined? And here's the [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2078.64s)]
*  problem with that is that if the United States actually thought that Xi was a dictator, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2084.08s)]
*  do you think that a mid-level fundraiser that we were all invited to in Northern California, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2089.84s)]
*  that none of us said yes to, is the place to announce a foreign policy shift like that? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2094.24s)]
*  Absolutely not. So it just means that, again, there's just more evidence about Biden being [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2098.72s)]
*  very undisciplined. Now, again, that could be an age issue. It could be a mental acuity issue. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2103.84s)]
*  We don't know because we're not given a chance to really prosecute that problem. Meanwhile, Tony's [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2109.8399999999997s)]
*  there trying to do the best job he can and the sands shift underneath him. Thank God he was able [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2115.68s)]
*  to get the trip done before this thing happened is what I think. But that gaffe was a very big gaffe [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2120.24s)]
*  and a very big problem, I think, because whatever goodwill he built up was practically flushed down [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2124.88s)]
*  the toilet if you saw the reaction from the Chinese, which was to be deeply offended. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2130.7999999999997s)]
*  And it makes no sense to poke. Yeah. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2136.2400000000002s)]
*  When he went to see NPS and they had to negotiate a fist pump versus a handshake, like, what is all [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2139.44s)]
*  of this either unplanned or undisciplined theater? Why are we engaging in any of this stuff? It [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2144.32s)]
*  doesn't make any sense. Shemaff, Joe Biden's always been known for being a liability in terms [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2151.2000000000003s)]
*  of these statements. When he worked for Obama, he was the VP. He also said things, you know, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2156.2400000000002s)]
*  he shot from the hip a lot. You should not be calling him a dictator when you're trying to do [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2161.28s)]
*  this critical work. It's a stupid move. I think everybody can agree. You were going to say something, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2164.88s)]
*  Brad? Yeah, I was just gonna say, you know, kind of market reaction going in. So the K web, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2169.6800000000003s)]
*  the Chinese index was up about 20% heading into these series of meetings. Now, notably, Blinken [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2175.6800000000003s)]
*  was not scheduled to have a meeting with Xi. And so what happened is on day one, there's a meeting [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2181.6s)]
*  with the foreign minister, right? And it seems that there was some positive trend lines coming [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2189.92s)]
*  out of these first two meetings with the top diplomat with foreign minister, which led to the [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2194.96s)]
*  meeting. And notably in the meeting, he did say the United States has not changed his policy on [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2199.44s)]
*  Taiwan. We don't support Taiwanese independence. Now, the market reaction post visit was down 10%. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2204.56s)]
*  And I think this is owing to what Shemaff said that people felt like maybe we took a step forward [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2211.2000000000003s)]
*  here that we at least had a meeting, but then it was a another step back. And so I think where we [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2217.84s)]
*  sit at the moment is there probably going to be some follow on meetings coming out of this. This [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2224.48s)]
*  was not, you know, a back a path back to where we were, but I think it was a stabilizing moment. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2229.36s)]
*  And you know, again, we were just at the East meets West Conference, where there are a lot of [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2236.7200000000003s)]
*  Chinese CEOs and founders who were there. And I think the idea there was like things are stable, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2241.1200000000003s)]
*  like not getting worse. And by the way, six months ago, there was a real concern that things were [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2246.8s)]
*  deteriorating quickly. So I think it's you know, you can see something constructive coming out of [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2252.2400000000002s)]
*  this. Not getting worse was how I felt coming out of it. And then Biden then makes it worse is [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2256.6400000000003s)]
*  really it is a I agree. It's just a stupid gap. Let me tell you about some of the reporting from [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2262.4s)]
*  the Chinese side. So after these diplomatic events, and you're right, Blinken met with [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2266.5600000000004s)]
*  Wang Yi for seven hours, then he got an audience with Xi Jinping. They do these readouts where each [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2272.08s)]
*  side basically produces a public summary of the meeting. In the Chinese readout, they said that [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2277.92s)]
*  US Chinese relationships are at the lowest point they've ever been. I mean, since I guess, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2284.24s)]
*  diplomatic relations were kind of reestablished under Nixon. So that from the Chinese standpoint, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2290.7999999999997s)]
*  they believe that relationships are at the worst they've ever been. Moreover, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2296.16s)]
*  the US sought to put Ukraine on the agenda. The Chinese response to that was we are not interested [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2302.24s)]
*  in discussing our relationship with Russia. That is none of your business. So this idea, there's [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2308.4s)]
*  been this neocon fantasy that somehow China would help us in this war between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2314.3199999999997s)]
*  And I've said all along that the last thing China wants is for neocons to achieve their [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2321.04s)]
*  objectives with respect to Russia, because then China alone will be in the gun sights of US Hawks. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2326.72s)]
*  So China will do what it has to do to support and even prop up Russia if they have to. Remember, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2332.7999999999997s)]
*  China and Russia, and specifically Xi and Putin, they're the two leaders who've met with each other [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2340.3199999999997s)]
*  more often than any other leader. And they've called each other their best friends or most, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2347.12s)]
*  I think the language they use was most bosom. Most bosom friends was what they called it. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2351.36s)]
*  Okay, that's a little weird. Yeah, but yeah, somebody great TV show. Good. Well, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2357.1200000000003s)]
*  yeah, exactly. Just to give people exactly what happened. Biden when he was at this [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2361.04s)]
*  campaign fundraiser in NorCal that again, yeah, we were probably invited to people on the show. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2366.0s)]
*  He was talking about the military Chinese spy balloon. And he said, she got very upset, quote, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2371.76s)]
*  that this was a great embarrassment for dictators when they don't know what happened. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2377.76s)]
*  And he continued to say that she didn't know the balloon had been over the continental US and was [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2383.36s)]
*  off course near Alaska. And this is the kind of thing where he's basically saying she is stupid, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2387.28s)]
*  or you know, whatever, or there's some level of incompetence over there. It's exactly the [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2391.6800000000003s)]
*  wrong message you want to send, calling him a dictator and calling him stupid and saying he [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2396.5600000000004s)]
*  was embarrassed. And why would you provoke that to raise money or to be a tough guy? It makes no sense. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2400.5600000000004s)]
*  I mean, it sounds like Trump's version of foreign relations. From the Chinese standpoint, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2405.68s)]
*  they thought the whole balloon thing was a travesty. I mean, I don't know what the truth [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2409.3599999999997s)]
*  of it is, but they feel like it was just this continuous drumming up of outrage on the American [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2413.12s)]
*  side against China. And they wanted to put that behind us in terms of the relationship. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2419.52s)]
*  I heard Blinken interviewed about this. Chamath, I agree with you. I have no [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2425.9199999999996s)]
*  complaint with Blinken in terms of how he handled this meeting. Tony, I have a complaint about how [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2429.44s)]
*  I have a complaint about how he handled Moscow, but not Beijing. But they wanted to put this balloon [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2434.72s)]
*  business behind them. My guess, I've always said that it never made sense to me that the Chinese [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2441.4399999999996s)]
*  would use such a ham-fisted way of conducting espionage to deliberately fly a balloon over [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2447.3599999999997s)]
*  the US. It was obviously not deliberate. It never made sense to me. And it became this cost [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2453.2s)]
*  leban the US. And I think the Chinese at a minimum wanted to put it behind us. And then Biden reopened [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2458.7999999999997s)]
*  the issue. Like this submarine tragedy, the balloon is like made for network television because it's a [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2465.12s)]
*  live event where you can put live cameras up and you can cover it 24 seven. It's just like Trump. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2470.9599999999996s)]
*  We better be really careful. It's just for the media. It's for the media. It's catnip for them. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2476.64s)]
*  We have to be very careful now, I think, in our relationship with China, because again, you now [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2480.72s)]
*  have this Asiatic alliance between China, Russia, and Iran. It is the most capable, let's say, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2485.12s)]
*  adversary the United States has ever faced. Remember that when we faced the Soviet Union, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2491.52s)]
*  their economy was never bigger than one third of the US economy, the Soviet bloc versus the [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2495.52s)]
*  Western bloc. The Chinese economy on a purchasing power parity basis is roughly the same size as [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2499.52s)]
*  the US. And they've got more manufacturing capacity. So if you think about the type of [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2505.2799999999997s)]
*  manufacturing capacity the United States had during World War Two, that now belongs to China, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2509.68s)]
*  not the US. We have hollowed out our manufacturing. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2514.8799999999997s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell I just don't understand why our foreign policy, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2518.0s)]
*  Brad, I'll bring you into this discussion, why our foreign policy isn't being driven by some of the [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2519.9199999999996s)]
*  things that we could do together to collaborate on. Like we have global warming, we have, you know, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2525.2799999999997s)]
*  issues on this planet that we could collaborate on. And it seems like we're spending no time [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2530.3999999999996s)]
*  on those issues and saber rattling. Cuba, another example, why can't we set a goal [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2534.56s)]
*  for the United States to normalize relations with Cuba and get them on our side since they are the [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2541.2s)]
*  equivalent of, let's say, Ukraine, David, to America, you've brought that comparison. Why [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2545.76s)]
*  don't we make peace with Cuba? Why can't we have a peace based foreign policy where we're trying to [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2551.04s)]
*  build bridges? God, Cuba and United States could do amazing things together. And we should be trying [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2556.56s)]
*  to win that relationship instead of living 50 years in the past over it. I'm not sure. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2562.48s)]
*  Alan Ross Powell There was legitimate outrage over the past week because we discovered that [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2568.16s)]
*  China was planning on, they already have an intelligence outpost in Cuba, listening outpost, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2571.28s)]
*  but also they're thinking about doing training of troops in Cuba. And that would be a violation of [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2576.88s)]
*  Monroe Doctrine. And we should basically get our backs up over that. The Monroe Doctrine states [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2583.52s)]
*  that no distant great power can bring troops, weapons or bases into the Western Hemisphere. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2590.0800000000004s)]
*  The United States spent over 100 years basically enforcing Monroe Doctrine. It would greatly [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2596.32s)]
*  diminish US security if we allowed any foreign great power to have troops in the Western [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2601.1200000000003s)]
*  Hemisphere. So we deserve to have our horns out over that. The problem is that we have our horns [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2606.4s)]
*  out over everything. And so we're not really taken seriously. We've pride wolfed so many times. I [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2612.2400000000002s)]
*  don't think we're really taken seriously by the Chinese on this. And this should be a teaching [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2616.4s)]
*  moment to the foreign policy establishment because this is Russia's objection. Russia's [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2620.2400000000002s)]
*  objection is to having American troops, weapons and bases directly on their border. This is our [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2625.92s)]
*  objection to what China is seeking to do in Cuba. Okay, Brad, do you want to add something to that? [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2631.44s)]
*  Or can we move to a comment? Just real quickly, I would say, there's a real appetite in the business [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2635.84s)]
*  community to be engaged. This idea that we're going to decouple the world, never have to deal [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2640.2400000000002s)]
*  with these folks, is just a farce. ByteDance bought a billion dollars worth of Nvidia chips [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2645.2s)]
*  announced this week. The world is entangled. And I think we would be better off having our political [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2651.68s)]
*  and business leaders in more sync over how to achieve this long-term safety and prosperity, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2658.8799999999997s)]
*  as opposed to what feels like a disjointed foreign policy relative to the global reality around AI and [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2666.64s)]
*  what's happening on the business. I agree. Well said. Yeah. I mean, it's just so obvious. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2675.52s)]
*  Why can't we be collaborating on stuff? And we see when you and I made our trip to the UAE, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2681.04s)]
*  and then we see the Saudis, you know, bringing movies back, we have certain regions we're doing [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2686.08s)]
*  a pretty good job of engaging with engagement. You know, reasonable engagement is a good idea. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2689.9199999999996s)]
*  It's because and I think RFK has said this, we have created a very dangerous revolving door [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2695.4399999999996s)]
*  between our most critical institutions and the largest industrial companies in the United States. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2703.4399999999996s)]
*  And that revolving door creates all kinds of conflicts of interest. And those things get [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2709.4399999999996s)]
*  sorted out via revenue and dollars and profits. Incentives. And so those incentives will drive [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2715.3599999999997s)]
*  us if it's the military industrial complex to go to war. And you're seeing that it'll complicate [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2722.56s)]
*  our foreign policy. So this is why I've always said the most important thing that we're doing [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2728.0s)]
*  is something that the military industrial complex cannot stop, which is our energy [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2733.2s)]
*  independence. And when you have energy independence and abundant costless energy, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2738.08s)]
*  I do think that the biggest thing you get is this peace dividend, you stop fighting these wars, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2742.8799999999997s)]
*  you become much more rational abroad. And you're like, Okay, I don't need to fight with all of [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2746.64s)]
*  these people. Because, you know, things are so great within our borders. You're so right, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2750.3199999999997s)]
*  Bob, because we actually have stopped those wars. And now we've created two other ones, Russia, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2754.3199999999997s)]
*  Ukraine, we can't help on China. What's that? We can't help ourselves. And we'll use the scarcity [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2758.64s)]
*  of commodities as a boogeyman to basically incentivize us to go in these foreign misadventures. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2765.6s)]
*  And it really has to stop by the way, just two quick points on that on Taiwan, there's an election [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2772.08s)]
*  next year. And it looks like right now that the pro China party might actually take power right [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2776.56s)]
*  now, the party that's in power is more of a pro Western party. And the reason I think is that the [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2782.96s)]
*  Taiwanese are looking at what's going on in Ukraine. And they're looking at the corpses of the [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2789.04s)]
*  Ukrainian youth pile up. And they're thinking maybe it's not such a great idea to be an American [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2793.92s)]
*  proxy state. Or the words of Henry Kissinger, he once quipped that it's dangerous to be an American [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2798.96s)]
*  enemy, but it's absolutely fatal to be an American friend. I think that this war may be backfiring in [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2805.6s)]
*  terms of the incentives is creating around Taiwan. Remember, Biden said that this war would basically [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2811.52s)]
*  help protect Taiwan by deterring China, it might actually deter Taiwan from opposing China. So we'll [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2817.04s)]
*  have to see how that plays out. All an able bodied person in Taiwan, a voting age needs to do [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2823.28s)]
*  is read the newspaper and understand that in the last two and a half years, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2828.56s)]
*  we've essentially started a multi trillion dollar program to deliver ourselves from all the critical [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2832.08s)]
*  resources that China and Taiwan gives us. And so if you're a Taiwanese citizen, the writing is [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2836.4s)]
*  unfortunately on the wall, which is that we are giving ourselves the optionality to not have to [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2841.6800000000003s)]
*  do anything. So to your point, David, if you're a rational thinking Taiwanese person, unfortunately, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2845.6s)]
*  you're forced to be in a position where you may have to head your bets. And if the United States [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2851.76s)]
*  can basically have chip supply that comes from Europe and Mexico, now all of a sudden the [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2856.48s)]
*  criticality of TSMC goes away. To wit, I published this tweet yesterday about [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2862.08s)]
*  Buffett and his trades in Japan, right? He bought these five trading companies and so just a really [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2868.64s)]
*  novel carry trade that I've really fallen in love with just understanding it. But the code out to [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2875.04s)]
*  that is that when he did this, and going long Japan, what he actually also did was he delivered [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2879.68s)]
*  himself from China, he had a long position in TSMC, and he said, I'm out. And when they asked him why [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2885.2799999999997s)]
*  he sold TSMC, he said, this is a very complicated thing. And he basically said that it's not a bet [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2891.36s)]
*  that's worth making. And I think underneath that, if I had to guess what he's trying to say about [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2897.76s)]
*  Taiwan indirectly, through his sale of TSMC is the odds are that we are not going to get into a land [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2902.96s)]
*  war over there, which means that that asset, and its equity value is in danger, and I don't want [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2910.6400000000003s)]
*  to own it. And I think that that's a very clinical summation of his rational action. So to your point, [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2916.88s)]
*  well, here's what Blinken said, speak with their dollars. I think this is very important. You know, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2924.32s)]
*  the one China policy says Taiwan is part of China, it's not an independent country, but we've had a [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2927.36s)]
*  very ambiguous and tolerance for this ambiguity of Taiwan acting as its own nation, while saying we [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2931.84s)]
*  support the one China policy and that ambiguity has served us very well in the China relationship. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2938.32s)]
*  Here's a blanket set at the press conference, quote, we do not support Taiwan independence, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2944.72s)]
*  we remain opposed to any unilateral changes to the status quo by either side. The status quo he's [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2949.4399999999996s)]
*  referring to here, Brad, is that they get to be independent in Taiwan. But we don't say they're [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2954.8799999999997s)]
*  independent, they are obviously acting in an independent manner. But it is not our business [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2960.3999999999996s)]
*  to tell the Taiwanese people that they're independent or not, it's their decision to determine if they're [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2965.04s)]
*  independent or not. Any thoughts on the trade by Buffett and Blinken's comment at the press [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2971.2s)]
*  conference and this ambiguity? I think we want to maintain the ambiguity. I think we're basically [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2979.6s)]
*  saying to China, don't change the status quo, at least for now. Right? While we rebuild these chip [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2984.7999999999997s)]
*  fabs in Arizona and other parts of the world, I think most of the wealthy families I've talked to [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=2993.8399999999997s)]
*  from Taiwan believe that five or six years from now, the US will no longer be in the position [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3000.24s)]
*  where they will need Taiwan and Taipei as much as they do today. And they're worried about- [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3005.9199999999996s)]
*  How many years do you think it will take to be independent? Say it one more time and explain it. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3011.44s)]
*  Well, it's not about being independent. It's how much longer will Taiwan have what they believe to [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3014.3999999999996s)]
*  be de facto protection from the United States. And I was told by one very influential Taiwanese family [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3020.72s)]
*  that they believe when the fifth chip fab comes online in Arizona, which I think is scheduled for [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3028.96s)]
*  25 or 26, they intended to have most of their family members out of Taiwan at that period in [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3035.36s)]
*  time. Now, I think most Taiwanese don't envision this being a violent invasion of Taiwan. It's [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3042.16s)]
*  more of a take under in the same way that Hong Kong was. And so I don't see an American president, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3049.04s)]
*  frankly, going to war, nor would I want them to go to war over Taiwan. But I think it's in all [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3056.88s)]
*  of our interest to maintain that status quo, which is why taunting the Chinese over the course of the [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3062.7200000000003s)]
*  past few years over Taiwan has seemed like a policy that's not fit with our goals. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3068.0s)]
*  Right. Well, if you look at skin in the game, the fact that the Chips Act went through so quickly, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3075.52s)]
*  the fact that Warren Buffett, as you pointed out, Schumoth made his bet, and this family that has, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3080.48s)]
*  obviously, you know, skin in the game, quite literally, are making these decisions, I think [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3084.88s)]
*  we know where this is headed. You can just follow the bets. And if you look at the bets in five [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3089.6s)]
*  years, follow the dollars, follow the dollars. And also where people put themselves geographically, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3093.6s)]
*  everybody left Hong Kong when the turnover happened or before it, they went to Singapore, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3099.36s)]
*  they went to UAE, they voted with their feet and their dollars. And that's obviously what's [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3103.6800000000003s)]
*  going to happen here. This is a good pivot, because this criticism of the Ukraine policy by [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3108.24s)]
*  Matt that Sachs pointed out came because there is a belief on his part and others that the pod here, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3115.7599999999998s)]
*  all in, is putting its unilateral support behind RFK. That is not true. There are two people on the [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3125.2s)]
*  pod who hosted a fundraiser last week. And here is what Matt incorrectly said, because [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3131.2s)]
*  I have not put my support behind RFK. I think he's very interesting, and I'm glad he's in the race. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3140.16s)]
*  And neither has Friedberg, but Schumoth and Sachs did host one and I'll hand it over to them. But [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3145.68s)]
*  here's what Matt said in his sub stack. And even though it's not the subject of this post, I do [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3150.8799999999997s)]
*  want to say that I think it's really sleazy and gross for the host of the All in Pocket to be [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3156.96s)]
*  engaging in this Kennedy boosterism as a bang shot way of harming Joe Biden's reelection prospects, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3162.64s)]
*  notwithstanding the recent conversions around Russia policy. Kennedy represents precisely [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3169.44s)]
*  the strand of progressive thought that right of center business people have highly, have rightly [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3174.0s)]
*  spent the better part of the century bemoaning. His is an anti-progress, anti-technology, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3179.12s)]
*  ultimately anti-human worldview that stands against biomedical progress, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3183.84s)]
*  against energy progress and against human flourishing. The guy who wants to blow up [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3188.32s)]
*  as many Ukrainians as possible as an or to deplete. Yeah, exactly. Pretty gross. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3191.1200000000003s)]
*  He thinks he's anti-human. Listen, I don't even think we should be giving him this much time. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3195.84s)]
*  Well, no, but I think it is important that because people now have connected this pod [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3199.04s)]
*  with the rise of RFK. This was the first major podcast he did. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3202.96s)]
*  What Iglesias is accusing us somehow of supporting RFK, not because of issues, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3206.32s)]
*  but somehow because it's a bang shot for Donald Trump, which is ridiculous. None of us support [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3212.8s)]
*  Donald Trump. He's not even my preferred candidate in the Republican lane. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3217.92s)]
*  Well, what he said was a bang shot against Biden, just to be clear. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3221.28s)]
*  I prefer RFK to Biden. It's that simple. What's wrong with that? He's not even making any [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3227.2000000000003s)]
*  arguments here. Look, we've explained in a lot of detail and I explained in my response, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3233.28s)]
*  all the issues where I support RFK. He supports free speech over censorship. He supports civil [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3237.52s)]
*  liberties over the surveillance state. He supports peace instead of war. He supports [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3243.36s)]
*  sealing the southern border virtually alone among Democrats and talking sense on that issue. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3247.12s)]
*  I believe that he's completely correctly diagnosed what we're doing in Ukraine. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3253.04s)]
*  On the issues I support RFK- You disagree with him on some issues, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3258.08s)]
*  right? You disagree with him on nuclear and you may disagree with him in his anti-vax stance, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3260.72s)]
*  if he is in fact anti-vax. Can I just- [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3265.44s)]
*  Hold on, let's finish those two. I think he was right about COVID lockdowns and I think he was [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3267.28s)]
*  right about the so-called COVID shot that wasn't even a vaccine, that that should not have been [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3270.64s)]
*  required. But what about those two issues? You obviously disagree with him on some things. Do [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3276.32s)]
*  you disagree with him on his anti-vax stuff and his nuclear stuff? I don't know enough about those [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3280.0s)]
*  issues to have a firm stance. What I would say is that every candidate represents a bundle of issues [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3286.4s)]
*  and you support the ones who are aligned with you on the issues that are most important to you. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3292.96s)]
*  On the issues that are most important to me, which are these questions, the great questions of [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3300.32s)]
*  war and peace and the questions of free speech and censorship. Even I would say the question [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3304.64s)]
*  of the economy and who do we prioritize because he wants to prioritize the middle class. On those [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3310.56s)]
*  big questions, I feel like I'm aligned with RFK. So that's why I support him. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3316.72s)]
*  Let me go to Chamath. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3321.68s)]
*  By the way, do you think Jack Dorsey is supporting RFK as a bank shot, something or other? No, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3323.04s)]
*  he's supporting it because he agrees to RFK on these questions of war and peace [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3328.56s)]
*  and free speech. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3333.3599999999997s)]
*  Great. I'm just letting everybody be very clear about their position since this is becoming, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3334.3199999999997s)]
*  the support of RFK by this podcast or two of the four people in the podcast is now becoming [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3339.68s)]
*  national news. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3344.56s)]
*  Iglesias is even making any arguments here. He's just applying derogatory labels to us. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3345.2s)]
*  This is a disciplinary tactic or a shaming tactic by the enforcers for the establishment. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3351.4399999999996s)]
*  We want to prevent independent thinkers from stepping out of line. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3358.9599999999996s)]
*  I agree. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3363.3599999999997s)]
*  That's what this is about. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3363.7599999999998s)]
*  It looks like this outsider went to the Dalton School in Harvard University, so there you have it. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3364.64s)]
*  Yeah, he got a $2 million education, doesn't know what a basis point is. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3369.52s)]
*  He's the guy with the basis points, right? He failed math when he graduated Dalton in Harvard. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3372.4s)]
*  Good luck with your substat, dude. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3379.52s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3381.2000000000003s)]
*  Chamath, you are pro-nuclear. You've been very clear about that. Although you're pro-renewables [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3382.32s)]
*  mostly, you've been clear about that on this podcast and many conversations I've had with you. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3386.96s)]
*  You are also pro-vaccine, but you're anti what happened with the lockdown. Maybe you could [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3390.96s)]
*  expand upon your support of RFK, why you held a fundraiser firm and what things you agree with [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3396.08s)]
*  them on and maybe what things you don't necessarily agree with them on. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3401.76s)]
*  Well, first I actually did what I think a lot of people haven't done, which is just listen to him. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3405.1200000000003s)]
*  Just stop talking, zip the old yapper. And there is an enormous amount of long form content [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3413.0400000000004s)]
*  where you can really understand where he stands on some of these topics. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3423.28s)]
*  He's right about the war on Ukraine. We shouldn't be in it. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3428.8s)]
*  He's right about free speech, which is we should have it. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3434.0s)]
*  He's right that the COVID vaccine was not a vaccine. And really what it's done is actually [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3440.56s)]
*  discredit the word vaccine, unfortunately, in a lot of people's minds. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3449.36s)]
*  He actually is a person that is pro-vaccine for all these other vaccines. He himself is vaccinated. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3453.52s)]
*  His children are vaccinated. You would all know this stuff if you just took two minutes to just [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3459.6s)]
*  listen to it. He is against the COVID vaccine. And what I would say is, I'm very sympathetic to [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3464.32s)]
*  that. I'm very sympathetic to the job the FDA had to do. And I think they generally did do a great [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3471.36s)]
*  job. But we ran something through and we allowed it to be labeled a word that misappropriates what [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3476.24s)]
*  it is. It's not a vaccine. And the problem with that is that it now makes people mistrust the [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3486.72s)]
*  measlemumps and rubella vaccine. That's crazy. You shouldn't mistrust the MMR vaccine or DTAP. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3493.7599999999998s)]
*  But because those things are lumped in with the same thing as a COVID vaccine that is at best 30 [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3500.56s)]
*  or 40 percent efficacious, we have these problems. He calls that out pretty honestly. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3505.52s)]
*  So I like the fact that he actually speaks in nuance. I like the fact that when I listen to him, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3510.88s)]
*  I find that the talking head think police are generally lying. It confirms what I believe [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3518.96s)]
*  about them because he just says things in a very plain spoken, intelligent way. And I think that [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3526.64s)]
*  there are a lot of folks who don't want to think who want to be given the simple answer, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3534.56s)]
*  who want to just reject what he stands for and just take the establishment view in the hopes [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3539.36s)]
*  that they'll get, I don't know, maybe accepted by the establishment. The establishment just [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3545.44s)]
*  wants to curate power. And I just think that people should be thinking for themselves. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3550.72s)]
*  If you listen to the Rogan podcast, if you listen to the Jordan Peterson podcast, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3555.6s)]
*  there are millions and millions and millions of links and page views and discussions and [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3560.0s)]
*  thoughts. And there's probably thousands of minutes of RFK explaining what he thinks on [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3566.24s)]
*  basically any topic you can imagine. You can get to your own conclusion. And I think what I think [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3570.64s)]
*  you'll find, and this is true for me, is there's 10 percent of stuff you are just vehemently [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3575.6s)]
*  supportive of 70% of stuff that's like quite reasonable and fair. And then there's the rest, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3583.44s)]
*  which is a spectrum of things I disagree with. But then you're left with a blended expected value [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3591.6s)]
*  where you're like, man, this guy is really better than all the other alternatives. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3596.56s)]
*  Brad, I'll let you go and then I'll give my position. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3601.44s)]
*  What I find most insidious about the opposition to this discussion is people [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3603.6s)]
*  are upset that you're not swearing in allegiance to a dogmatism. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3609.76s)]
*  Right. The truth of the matter is this group has hosted dinners for Ro Khanna, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3614.0s)]
*  for Senator Manchin. We've hosted dinners for DeSantis. Right. Had I been here, I would have put [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3620.88s)]
*  my name on the dinner for Kennedy because I want to gather information. I'm an analyst. I want to [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3627.28s)]
*  think for myself, how can we spend trillions and put ourselves into potentially harm's way [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3634.4s)]
*  without having a real conversation in Congress and on these pods about the risk of war? [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3644.0s)]
*  Why can't we have an authentic post-mortem about the efficacy of the COVID vaccine without being [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3651.04s)]
*  shamed? The revolution going on in this country, which is fantastic from my perspective, is that [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3657.52s)]
*  there is no longer a monopolistic control over the discussion. And that's why this podcast and [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3663.76s)]
*  this friendship and the conversation we all had here is resonating with people because they also [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3670.8s)]
*  want to hear all the different sides because most people are capable, are way smarter than the elites [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3677.2000000000003s)]
*  on the coast think. You know, I'm from Indiana, lots of smart folks who think for themselves in [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3683.36s)]
*  Indiana, but they're told by coastal elites what to think. And they reject this. And that's what [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3689.2s)]
*  you're seeing in this discussion and so many of these others. It's not about vaccines. It's not [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3695.12s)]
*  about a war. It's about their control over how you think and them wanting to force you to swear to [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3700.16s)]
*  an orthodoxy. I think that's really well said. Yeah, that is well said. But the way they try [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3707.3599999999997s)]
*  to control what you think is by labeling candidates so as to exclude them or make them [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3712.72s)]
*  sound crazy. So, J. Cal, I mean, you kind of introduced RFK as an anti-vaxxer. I don't think [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3719.2s)]
*  that is the correct way to describe his position or the singular way that he should be labeled. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3725.8399999999997s)]
*  No, I don't believe that. I said, here are the things he believes that we agree with. And then [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3731.9199999999996s)]
*  I gave the things that the media is saying. You know, so I was trying to present the totality of [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3735.6s)]
*  it. And I said, he is obviously in favor of the middle class and all this stuff. So [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3740.48s)]
*  I want to be clear on my position here. So I am in support of vibrant long form debate like we have [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3746.4s)]
*  here. And I'm in support of anybody who takes on the establishment, because there are crazy [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3752.48s)]
*  incentives as we talk about here, incentives matter. And we are long overdue for discussion [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3757.84s)]
*  on vaccines. But it's very important that everybody understand here that everybody on this podcast [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3762.88s)]
*  took the COVID vaccine. And everybody here, our kids have been vaccinated. It's not a vaccine. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3767.84s)]
*  Exactly. So they took the COVID reduction. We were injected with an experimental mRNA treatment [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3773.44s)]
*  because we got hoodwinked by the media into thinking it would prevent us from ever getting [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3778.48s)]
*  COVID, which it did not do. I think two months later, I got Delta variants. Vaccines are good. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3782.8s)]
*  And the COVID thing was not very good. And it reduced death in older people and probably was [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3788.6400000000003s)]
*  the only group of people and we'll know when we do a postmortem. But do not take- [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3795.44s)]
*  Now we got this mRNA like flowing through our bodies. Who knows? It might be a time bomb. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3800.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, and then for people who are wondering like if we should even be having these discussions, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3806.16s)]
*  the hypocrisy of the media I think is very important to look at here because the media [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3811.52s)]
*  is going to be attacking this podcast over and over again. Not that it matters. But when we moved [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3816.88s)]
*  into the top 100, top 50, top 10, that's when the knives came out. And I would like to remind [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3821.36s)]
*  the media of the long history of investigative journalism and debates. What was once a conspiracy [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3826.96s)]
*  theory often goes on to win a Pulitzer Prize. And, you know, the hypocrisy here is crazy because [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3835.04s)]
*  if you look at some of the greatest stories and investigative journalists pieces, they started [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3841.28s)]
*  with these debates, rumors, et cetera. Abu Ghraib, that was the New Yorker. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3846.48s)]
*  Ralph Nader unsaved at any speed- That was Sy Hersh's reporting. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3851.6s)]
*  Yes. That was Sy Hersh's reporting and he can't get the time of day. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3853.52s)]
*  And now they're discrediting him. Right. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3855.36s)]
*  He can't get the time of day for his report on who really destroyed Nord Stream. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3857.36s)]
*  The Catholic Church sex scandal, the Boston Globe. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3861.04s)]
*  The mainstream media does not perform the function that you're describing anymore. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3864.32s)]
*  They act as the bodyguard for the elite, for the establishment. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3867.68s)]
*  They actually have even of late- They are stenographers for the people in power. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3871.68s)]
*  Not exactly true. They have actually done incredible reporting, but there is a group of them, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3875.92s)]
*  which is Towing the Party Wine, because you have the New York Times and their exposition on the [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3880.88s)]
*  Taxi Commission. That won a Pulitzer in 2020. And then you look at- [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3884.8s)]
*  Taxi caps? I know you don't follow Pulitzers [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3889.76s)]
*  or investigative journalism. In 2020, Brian Rosenthal at the New York Times did a massive [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3891.84s)]
*  expose on the predatory New York City taxi industry. And then at the same time- [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3896.48s)]
*  Okay. Well, that might be important to New Yorkers. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3901.2000000000003s)]
*  There's a few other issues that might be more important to the nation. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3903.28s)]
*  It was an example of protectionism and rent-seeking. The Enron scandal, big tobacco, [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3906.32s)]
*  60 minutes. What about the pretzel monopoly in the [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3912.5600000000004s)]
*  south part of the Bronx? What about that hot dog vendor on Fifth [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3915.28s)]
*  Avenue that- No, no. You guys are uninformed. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3919.2000000000003s)]
*  Didn't have all of his licenses up to date. I thought there was a halal span that became [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3921.28s)]
*  people botulism. You guys are super informed. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3925.28s)]
*  The fact is, at the same time that the New York Times, CNN were attacking what Uber was doing, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3928.0s)]
*  the New York Times won a fucking Pulitzer for their coverage of predatory loans by rich, [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3935.36s)]
*  powerful people in New York City. I bet they also did a great story on the [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3941.12s)]
*  guy selling trinkets outside Penn Station without a license, right? [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3944.96s)]
*  For somebody who's a man of the people like yourselves, actually, should actually be more [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3948.72s)]
*  informed. Okay. Well, what they should be reporting on, for example, if the Pulitzers [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3951.28s)]
*  work the way they should, is where patient zero came from on COVID. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3957.44s)]
*  Because Michael Schoenberg just reported this over the last week, and it got picked up by [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3962.48s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal that patient zero, it turns out, was a researcher at the Wuhan lab [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3966.7200000000003s)]
*  who was performing gain-of-function research. Yeah, shocker. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3973.28s)]
*  Another conspiracy theory proven true. And will wind up being a Pulitzer. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3977.44s)]
*  He deserves a Pulitzer. He does. And the crazy thing about this [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3982.56s)]
*  conspiracy theory that turned out to be true is like, it brought together the most odd bedfellows, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3986.48s)]
*  Rand Paul and John Stewart. When Rand Paul and John Stewart can be in a room and agree on basically [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3992.16s)]
*  the totality of a topic, we should all just pay attention because it's not a normal world in which [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=3998.8s)]
*  these two guys would otherwise get along. Right. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4004.56s)]
*  And both of them nailed it from day one. Right, they have the same name. But now, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4008.08s)]
*  connect the dots further, okay? Why was the truth suppressed? Why did it not come out? [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4012.96s)]
*  Because Fauci had funded gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab via EcoHealth Alliance. So, [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4018.56s)]
*  he knew that if at the beginning of this pandemic, it turned out that he had been partially [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4026.2400000000002s)]
*  responsible for the creation of this virus that had now turned into a pandemic around the world, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4032.32s)]
*  his career would have been over. And it's worse, Sax. It's even worse than that. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4037.92s)]
*  46% of the advertising on TV news comes from pharma, and we did not always allow pharma spending. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4042.48s)]
*  And this is, may not be one-to-one. It may not be that a specific person [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4050.48s)]
*  doing a report at CNN or Fox or any of the networks is saying, oh, I'm going to lose my job if I write [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4055.76s)]
*  something critical of pharma. But they're not doing the investigative pieces on, I can tell you this, [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4061.52s)]
*  on the people who have 46% of their advertising revenue, unless it really, [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4066.88s)]
*  you know, gets to the final inning on something. And that is something that we need to question. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4072.88s)]
*  Right. The media is funded 46% by pharma companies. And pharma companies were given a pass. And if you [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4078.7200000000003s)]
*  criticize any of the pharma companies, the media is going to come for you. And so, listen, I'm not [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4088.2400000000002s)]
*  tinfoil, but you do have to look at its sentence. No, that is not tinfoil. Listen, [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4093.7599999999998s)]
*  the media is funded by big pharma, and its primary sources are these high-level government [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4097.28s)]
*  employees who've been there forever who leak them information. That is why the New York Times was [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4102.639999999999s)]
*  carrying water for Fauci and big pharma. This is the marriage of state power and corporate greed [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4107.84s)]
*  that RFK Jr. denounces. Yeah. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4114.08s)]
*  Well, there you have it, folks. And he believes he could be assassinated by the CIA. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4117.5199999999995s)]
*  No, he didn't say it like that. He didn't say it like that. He was asked what is his [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4122.48s)]
*  strategy on campaigning and all of that stuff. And he said, look, I'm going to do as much as [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4127.44s)]
*  possible. But one thing that I'm going to avoid are like these open air parades, just because [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4133.919999999999s)]
*  there's just a lot of folks that we can't control, crowd control. Yeah. Okay. Reasonable. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4139.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, the conversation with Rogan went something like this. Rogan was asking questions [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4146.0s)]
*  about the Kennedy assassinations and RFK believes like something like 60% of the American public [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4149.76s)]
*  believes that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone. Then Rogan asked him, well, do you ever feel afraid [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4156.88s)]
*  running for office? And his answer was basically, no, not really. It's not something that I'm [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4163.52s)]
*  preoccupied with. But yeah, I'll take precautions. Does that mean he thinks the CIA is going to [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4168.4800000000005s)]
*  assassinate him? No, that's not what he said. But that is how the media reported it, including [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4173.360000000001s)]
*  Fox News, that became the soundbite. Well, the soundbite from this podcast was [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4178.080000000001s)]
*  that he believes his uncle was and his father were that the CIA was involved in assassinations. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4181.84s)]
*  A lot of people believe that, Jason. A lot of people. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4187.4400000000005s)]
*  I am not giving my opinion on it. I'm giving his opinion on it. He said it on this podcast. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4189.200000000001s)]
*  And the CIA won't release all the information to this day, even though they've been commanded to [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4193.200000000001s)]
*  do so. So make your own decision, folks. According to Bloomberg, there is a ton of action for startup [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4197.360000000001s)]
*  shares in secondary markets. If you don't know what a secondary market is, that's when one investor [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4202.64s)]
*  buys shares in a company that's not yet public directly from another investors on the cap table. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4206.88s)]
*  So if Stripe, which is not yet public or Reddit, there are shares floating around in those companies, [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4212.16s)]
*  either previous employees or previous investors, one firm might see an opportunity there and buy [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4217.6s)]
*  them. As this process of bottoming out has occurred, Pitchbook reported Tiger Global [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4221.92s)]
*  told secondary investors, and that's a class of people who like to buy these, that they could bid [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4227.76s)]
*  on any individual private company in its portfolio. They tried to sell a bundle of these [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4232.4s)]
*  shares, about 30 startups at a time, but they couldn't find buyers according to the reports. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4237.36s)]
*  So now they're allowing people to bid on per company on a per company basis. Some of these [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4242.5599999999995s)]
*  are being marked down a third 50%, etc. Here's the quote from Bloomberg. As of May 31 shares of [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4247.2s)]
*  startups were trading at a median discount of 61% compared to valuations at their latest funding [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4255.92s)]
*  rounds according to report by Forge Global Holdings. A16 according to the report is actively [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4260.56s)]
*  buying shares in secondary, Excel, Bain, Bessemer, Kleiner are also using secondary to grow stakes [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4266.240000000001s)]
*  in their existing investments doubling down. As it were crossover firms like Cotu, Tiger Global, [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4271.120000000001s)]
*  and even Brad's Altimeter are actively searching for deals. So Brad, your thoughts on this? Is this [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4277.52s)]
*  sign of a bottom? And why are you doing this? It's sign of a bottom. Yeah, it is. It is true. I mean, [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4283.4400000000005s)]
*  our job is to look at all these companies understand their value. Okay, you know, [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4289.76s)]
*  I'm sitting here looking at a list that I was given this morning, 125 companies secondary, [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4292.8s)]
*  you know, the Goldman Sachs unprofitable tech index in the public market is down 64% as of this [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4298.400000000001s)]
*  one unprofitable public. They put together a basket, they track unprofitable public companies [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4305.280000000001s)]
*  down 64% off of its peak as of this morning. So you just quoted the Bloomberg article saying, [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4311.6s)]
*  yeah, these unprofitable tech companies in the private markets are down about 6061%. That smells [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4317.6s)]
*  right to me. The repricings have to occur. These have to occur. Right? There are 1400 unicorns at [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4323.200000000001s)]
*  the end of 2022. And 100% of them will likely do a down run. And if you said what is the average [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4332.160000000001s)]
*  that they're going to be down, it's over 50%. You saw the repricings out of some of the best ones, [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4339.360000000001s)]
*  like a Canva or a Stripe where it was down, let's call it 30, 40, 50%. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4345.84s)]
*  But you know, they're going to be companies like in the public markets that are down 80 or 90% [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4350.48s)]
*  and disappear altogether. So we didn't see the repricings. Okay. And by the way, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4355.12s)]
*  when we say, you know, that article quotes, Forge, that is what the sellers are offering to sell [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4361.92s)]
*  shares for. That is not where transactions are clearing. Right? So why hasn't Altimeter [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4369.44s)]
*  purchased any of this? Because the prices aren't low enough to induce me to get off the sidelines [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4376.48s)]
*  to purchase the shares. But we're within kind of, you know, we're starting to get in the zone [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4382.24s)]
*  where we can underwrite to a margin of safety competitive or better than the public markets [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4387.759999999999s)]
*  for companies that we think are great companies. Now out of those 1400 unicorns at the end of [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4393.599999999999s)]
*  2022, there are probably less than 5% of those companies I would even want to own [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4399.2s)]
*  at the right price. Right? So it's a small subset of companies, the price has to get to this clearing [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4404.8s)]
*  point. But you know, I think over the course of the next 18 months, we're going to see an acceleration [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4410.96s)]
*  of market clearing events as these companies need to raise capital as their employees want to get [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4417.84s)]
*  liquid on shares. And it's probably see some great opportunities. But most of these things [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4423.2s)]
*  that get put on sale should not be purchased, right? Most of them, even you know, the first [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4429.84s)]
*  sale price is never the last sale price, the markdown on the black t shirts will continue. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4435.84s)]
*  Travother Sachs, any thoughts? Are you buying in secondary? Are you looking at this? [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4441.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we'll look at secondary deals. It's not primarily what we do, but we're open to it. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4444.96s)]
*  But Brad, if you were to categorize the 1400 unicorns into one of three categories, [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4449.12s)]
*  what do you think the percentages would be those three categories being zombie corns, [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4453.92s)]
*  like unicorn companies that just don't deserve to exist that are product market fit, and they're [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4458.8s)]
*  going to go away? Category two would be viable companies that are just overpriced or headed [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4464.0s)]
*  for a down round. And the number three would be the ones that are actually headed for an upround. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4469.36s)]
*  Yeah, I would say 30 to 40% are these companies that were valued over a billion dollars that [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4475.44s)]
*  don't have product market fit, they'll disappear. Zombie companies that will disappear. Right. And [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4481.36s)]
*  listen, just to be fair, let's explain. Most of these companies, right, have less than 200 [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4487.04s)]
*  million of preference, preferred shares that venture capitalists invest into the company. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4494.24s)]
*  And many of those companies in that 30, 40%, there's a team, there's some asset of value, [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4500.88s)]
*  they may be able to sell the talent of the team and recoup, David, let's call it 30, 40% of the [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4506.24s)]
*  pref stack, right, in that transaction, we're starting to see some of those occur. Then I [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4513.36s)]
*  think the lion's share of the companies that are left, let's call it another 40%. These are companies [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4518.96s)]
*  that should never have been marked at these prices, right, but they do have a business, [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4527.2s)]
*  and they're going to be marked down, you know, 50 to 80%. But all of those like none of those have [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4531.84s)]
*  been able to grow through it, then there's less than 10% of the companies, right, whose growth has [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4538.639999999999s)]
*  been so robust through this period, that they've actually grown into or within 10 15% of those [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4544.4s)]
*  prior prices. And if you do all of that work, it puts us back on trendline, right, the only thing [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4551.04s)]
*  unusual here is how far off trendline we had 1400 unicorns, right in 2020, we had I think 145 IPOs, [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4557.76s)]
*  in the last two years, we've had four. Okay, so there's a huge backlog, these companies aren't [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4568.16s)]
*  getting public Why because public market buyers like ourselves, we're not willing to pay the prices [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4575.12s)]
*  that were in the private market. So the first step is to just have these clearing events. And [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4580.08s)]
*  it's David, you and I heard sober talk over the course of the last couple of days, I think they, [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4584.8s)]
*  you know, said to the founders very clearly, you need to sell your businesses or you need to get [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4590.08s)]
*  profitable. There is no middle ground. In other news, Ford has been issued a conditional $9.2 [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4594.48s)]
*  billion loan from the US Department of Energy to build out three 123 EV battery factories, [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4599.92s)]
*  specifically alone is coming through the Department of Energy's LPO. That's the loan [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4606.72s)]
*  program's office, they've got about 400 billion to lend out. You might remember this from 2010, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4610.8s)]
*  when they gave cylindra a 123 batteries, which eventually went bankrupt and got bought by a [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4617.04s)]
*  Chinese company, I believe, and Tesla, a $465 million loan, Tesla paid it back, the other two [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4623.280000000001s)]
*  didn't test pay back with interest. Jigar Shah, the director of the loan program office described [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4629.2s)]
*  the lending moves as a way to onshore and reshore manufacturing, the goal of the program is not [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4634.72s)]
*  innovation, but to get more of the supply chain to be manufactured in the US. Guess [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4641.04s)]
*  some people are criticizing this just out of the gate with why should we be giving these loans to [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4649.12s)]
*  companies shouldn't this be the private sector doing it? Moth, what are your thoughts here? [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4655.68s)]
*  Is this a good idea, a great idea, neutral idea? [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4659.92s)]
*  It's a great idea. Explain. It's us using our balance sheet to make sure that we get to energy [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4663.5199999999995s)]
*  independence. So this is actually a perfect role for government. It's shaping incentives so that [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4669.599999999999s)]
*  capitalism can do its job. What this does for Ford is Ford has a partnership with SK. And so [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4677.04s)]
*  SK has a lot of capability in Korea, but they can bring that know how now domestically onshore to [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4684.08s)]
*  the United States, you'll be hiring 1000s of people, you'll be building battery factories, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4690.48s)]
*  Ford needs batteries, their forecast is they'll be selling two and a half million electric vehicles by [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4694.64s)]
*  2026 2027. So whatever Ford does, you can expect GM will also do. You can expect all of the other [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4699.84s)]
*  big companies to do so this is all just great. And at the end of the day, for people to not over, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4707.28s)]
*  this is 9.8 billion, I guess it sounds like a lot, but we're probably spending 9.8 billion [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4713.44s)]
*  dollars a day fighting wars. So this is a day of just taking a pause on all these dumb wars, [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4718.4s)]
*  and actually becoming energy reliant, carbon neutral, fixing the climate. It's great jobs, [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4724.799999999999s)]
*  energy independence, and less dependency on autocratic nations. It seems like good idea. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4733.599999999999s)]
*  Everything should be how about instead of thinking about it in terms of wars, let's think about it [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4739.36s)]
*  in terms of so if the the DOD budget is $800 billion, okay. per year, what is that 2.6 billion [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4743.2s)]
*  a day 2.7 billion a day. Okay, so we're talking about three days. Four days, Monday, Tuesday, [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4754.08s)]
*  Wednesday, Thursday, you want to say private should probably be doing I agree with your mouth about [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4761.76s)]
*  the wars. But this is all money we don't have. I mean, we shouldn't be spending the money on wars, [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4769.12s)]
*  and we shouldn't be spending it, I think, on industrial policy. So first of all, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4774.16s)]
*  one of our friends who's an energy investor, we should beep his name, but was telling me [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4778.5599999999995s)]
*  that the energy subsidies that were in the, you know, misnamed inflation reduction act, [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4783.76s)]
*  it is like the biggest bonanza of all time. He said that the energy sector is going crazy now [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4789.36s)]
*  trying to figure out how to exploit these incentives. And his view is that although I [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4796.48s)]
*  think it was supposed to cost about $350 billion, he thought that it would ultimately cost the [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4802.16s)]
*  government somewhere around a trillion, because the way these subsidies work is that you just [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4806.959999999999s)]
*  qualify for them. And then you get the subsidy. It's not like the credits run out. So if you [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4811.679999999999s)]
*  qualify, you get it. So this could end up costing the government way more than what was originally [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4816.32s)]
*  projected. And so the question is, what are you going to get for all this money? And in this [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4820.879999999999s)]
*  article on Ford, they were talking about these 7000 jobs are being created at a cost of $440,000 [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4825.6s)]
*  per job. So it's great that the jobs are being created. But if you look at the efficiency of [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4832.88s)]
*  that, that spend per job doesn't really make sense. I don't understand how you get that number you [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4839.120000000001s)]
*  take. That's why the article said it. The article said for 440,000. Do you take 9.8 billion and [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4844.56s)]
*  divide it by 7000? What do you do? I'm just quoting that paragraph of the article. So [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4851.12s)]
*  the job creation is good, but you got to look at the efficiency of the job creation. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4856.72s)]
*  The other thing is, the question I would ask you guys actually is, who wants one of these Ford EVs? [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4860.88s)]
*  Do you want an EV by Ford? I think there are a lot of people that drive a Ford pickup truck. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4866.8s)]
*  We talked about this before. So that's 150 is coming. Yeah, very popular. There was an article [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4873.599999999999s)]
*  in the Wall Street Journal a few months ago, which talked about the brand consideration cycle [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4878.8s)]
*  that has been going on. And there was a large look, we're friends with Elon, but we should [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4883.2s)]
*  acknowledge there's a large number of people that are frankly, a little bit turned off by him. And [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4887.6s)]
*  they've been very clear that they want an alternative to Tesla, because they don't want [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4892.8s)]
*  to buy Tesla, because they don't necessarily prefer him as a brand ambassador for their car. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4895.68s)]
*  And the reality of life is that even if you're like maximally incredible, unless you find some [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4900.8s)]
*  clever way of creating a monopoly, in which case you can be a douche or evil, you're only ever going [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4907.92s)]
*  to capture 30 plus 40%, maybe have a market Coke Pepsi is a good example. And so there's always [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4914.0s)]
*  going to be long tail alternatives. And, you know, I had a chance, for example, in Vegas to drive [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4920.0s)]
*  a Rivian, I was surprised at the quality or drive in a Rivian, I was surprised at the quality of [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4924.96s)]
*  Rivian only because I've been so focused on Tesla my whole life. So yeah, I think there are a lot [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4930.08s)]
*  of people that will buy Ford's doesn't take anything away from what Elon's doing. But I do [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4935.36s)]
*  think there are a lot of people that will buy it. My problem with industrial policy is this you think [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4939.04s)]
*  about that EV summit that the White House did, they didn't even invite Elon. And that that was [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4942.799999999999s)]
*  for political reasons, union reasons. Yeah, partly because of his views on speech, but I think mostly [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4947.04s)]
*  because he's not a union shop. Right. And so that's the real reason why Ford is being doled out this [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4952.639999999999s)]
*  sort of 9 point something billion dollar loan is because they're politically connected with the [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4959.36s)]
*  right people in this current administration. And that's the problem with industrial policy is that [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4965.44s)]
*  the money gets handed out by government to the politically connected in this case, Tesla goes [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4970.08s)]
*  to the companies that may be producing the best products. The fact is, Tesla did get one of his [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4974.88s)]
*  loans in 2010 when it was a very nascent company. So you got to give them some credit, they took a [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4979.04s)]
*  big risk there. But let's think about that for a second. Okay, because I know that example comes [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4983.759999999999s)]
*  up a lot. And a 123 and cylindra. Yeah. So Elon was basically a fluke. I mean, you get like a once [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4987.12s)]
*  in a generation entrepreneur who have to be working on this EV problem. And he got that loan. If you're [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4994.0s)]
*  to take Elon out of that government portfolio, it all looks like cylindra. Yep. So the question is, [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=4999.599999999999s)]
*  like, what is this portfolio going to look like? Is there really going to be another Elon in there? [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5006.64s)]
*  Because if not, there's gonna be a lot of cylindras. But even if they break even, there's [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5010.64s)]
*  gonna be a lot of subsidies to companies like Ford, which are politically connected. And I think [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5014.88s)]
*  a point Freiburg would make if he were here, is that at some point, you're gonna have to turn off [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5019.28s)]
*  the subsidies because we can't afford it. And then at that point, is that factor gonna be self [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5024.32s)]
*  sufficient? Brad, you want to you've heard the two sides of the story here. Listen, while generally [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5028.96s)]
*  against industrial policy, I come down on Chimassad, I think this is a once in a generation opportunity [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5036.16s)]
*  to reduce our national security risk profile and to achieve what is really a national security [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5042.56s)]
*  imperative, which is energy independence, it's not going to happen just according to the invisible [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5050.72s)]
*  hand of the market. We see our, you know, great power competitors who are using this against us, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5056.160000000001s)]
*  frankly, and have robust industrial policies. So I'm willing to stipulate that there will be [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5063.04s)]
*  those inefficiencies in this system. But I was lucky, lucky enough, last night, I was having [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5068.64s)]
*  dinner with the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adiyama, who was out here meeting with [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5073.200000000001s)]
*  founders, including battery founders in Silicon Valley, on this very subject. And I know some of [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5078.56s)]
*  the companies who are getting checks from the US government to scale up, right, innovative battery [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5084.72s)]
*  technologies, innovative chip manufacturing. And I have to say, this is the best of America. I see [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5090.56s)]
*  some really great public private partnerships that are on shoring vital national interest in [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5098.16s)]
*  chips and batteries. And so I'm happy to see it happening. But I also know there will be grift [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5105.5199999999995s)]
*  and there will be waste along the way. But compare that David, to the 8 trillion we've spent over the [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5110.24s)]
*  last 20 years of war policy, and what we've gotten from that. So you know, you know, I'd rather see us [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5115.5199999999995s)]
*  take chances here on innovative battery technologies that potential ways but not as wasteful [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5122.32s)]
*  as a war. Well, of course, I mean, the first thing we got to do is turn off all these crazy wars, [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5128.08s)]
*  but that can't be the bar because that's a very low bar. Anything's more productive than [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5132.16s)]
*  war, wasting the money blowing up other countries that we don't need to be involved in. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5136.64s)]
*  I mean, remember, we do have a $32 trillion debt. I think a great thing to do here is what they [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5142.16s)]
*  should have done with Tesla, which is when they give that $500 million loan to Tesla, they should [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5146.64s)]
*  have gotten 10% of that in warrants to buy Tesla shares at the IPO, 50 million at that IPO would [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5151.6s)]
*  have gone what 200 x and that would have been an incredible payday. So if they give this 9.2 billion [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5156.48s)]
*  to Ford, why not get 900 million in warrants to buy shares of Ford? [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5162.639999999999s)]
*  So you want the government to become a VC? [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5165.679999999999s)]
*  No, I want them to get a little participation in the upside of the company. I don't want them to [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5167.679999999999s)]
*  own it. I want them to have potential participation. Well, I'm giving a modest number here. So [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5173.04s)]
*  Right now, they're a VC without participation. But [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5178.0s)]
*  Right now they're a loan that gets paid back with interest. And I'm saying give them some upside in [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5181.28s)]
*  the equity, even if it's a small piece, would you object to that, Sachs? [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5185.92s)]
*  You basically want to make them a venture debt provider, like SVB? [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5188.56s)]
*  Basically, yeah, like venture debt. Give them a pot sweetener. Yes. Yes. Give them a pot sweetener. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5191.84s)]
*  Why not? [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5196.56s)]
*  It didn't work out so good for SVB. You may not remember that, but [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5196.8s)]
*  It would have worked out incredibly well with their pressing debt on Tesla. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5199.68s)]
*  Jason, it doesn't solve my problem. You might drive a better deal for the US government in [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5202.4s)]
*  that case, which is fine with me, but it doesn't solve my objection, which is at the end of the [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5206.32s)]
*  day, these decisions are going to be made based on political criteria. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5210.88s)]
*  Got it. Okay. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5214.5599999999995s)]
*  And we're going to end up with crony capitalism and state capitalism, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5215.2s)]
*  as opposed to entrepreneurial capitalism. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5218.16s)]
*  This is in support of that because this is a deal where that 9.8 billion does come over, [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5219.84s)]
*  but these are basically like loans and loan guarantees, and you still have to put up the [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5224.72s)]
*  equity yourself. That doesn't solve anybody's problem, meaning you need to still be entrepreneurial. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5228.08s)]
*  And there needs to be risk capital. In this case, risk capital is coming from Ford and SK. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5232.88s)]
*  And I think that that's my understanding of this. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5236.96s)]
*  I'm just really suspicious because it is Ford. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5239.5199999999995s)]
*  Chamoff is that this was like 90% of the cost or 95% of the cost. So there's not much risk [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5240.719999999999s)]
*  capital here from Ford or SK. I mean, it might be opportunity cost, but it's not. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5244.5599999999995s)]
*  The full cost of these three factories is almost $13 billion. So there's still a non-trivial amount [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5248.799999999999s)]
*  of risk capital that has to get put to work here. Man, I would love to only have to put up 20% on [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5255.44s)]
*  the dollar, 30 cents on the dollar at my investments. I think Brad does make a good point about the [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5260.4s)]
*  security of our supply chain. I'm more willing to use this sort of industrial policy when we're [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5265.76s)]
*  talking about something that is vital to the security of the United States. I think you can [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5270.64s)]
*  make that argument with chips. I don't think electric vehicles rise to that quite that level. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5274.16s)]
*  Batteries might. I don't know. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5279.280000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't say batteries do, but I think obtaining a secure supply of the rare earths [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5281.68s)]
*  that are needed to make batteries, there's maybe a role for government in that. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5286.400000000001s)]
*  The reason batteries must is because the only way to wean ourselves off of the dependence we have [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5290.4s)]
*  on fossil fuels around the world, and even though we produce and we're now a net exporter of oil, [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5298.16s)]
*  the reality is we're still in entanglements around the world because the world is dependent [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5305.44s)]
*  upon those fossil fuels. And so I do think that that is a national security interest, [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5310.96s)]
*  having energy independence, not only for ourselves. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5316.799999999999s)]
*  If Germany was energy independent and kept their nuclear running and didn't have Nord Stream, [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5319.6s)]
*  we'd have a different situation here right now. We'd have a much different situation. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5323.120000000001s)]
*  We got plenty of oil and gas over here. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJQmCFTYCh8&t=5326.64s)]
