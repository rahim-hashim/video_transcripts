# In conversation with Vivek Ramaswamy
**All In Podcast:** [July 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8)
*  Saxi, can you can you come outside your window and I'm going to start waiting and you'll see me want to see me? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=0.0s)]
*  Zach have two of your butlers hold you up on their shoulders. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5.28s)]
*  I hope this is being taped and part of the show because this is great. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=9.76s)]
*  David, you're wearing blue shorts, right? Yeah. Yeah, I saw you. Did you see me? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=13.08s)]
*  Not in see you? Where are you? When you look out on the first house, the pink house. Look at this house. You see that? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=17.84s)]
*  I heard you. I couldn't see you though. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=23.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=25.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=26.56s)]
*  Yelling like a lunatic. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=27.8s)]
*  You're the pink house. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=29.8s)]
*  Look, I'm like below me or above me. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=31.2s)]
*  No, I'm like to your right. If you're looking out, I'm at your right. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=33.56s)]
*  Your first house on the right. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=37.16s)]
*  Oh, there. Oh, I see you. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=38.28s)]
*  I see you. I see you guys are like 12 year olds. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=43.36s)]
*  Come over afterwards. We'll have a glass. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=46.4s)]
*  OK, I'm going to come over afterwards. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=47.84s)]
*  That gives a hard stop. We should go. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=50.4s)]
*  Rain man, David. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=56.36s)]
*  All right. Vivek Ramaswamy is finally on the program. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=68.88s)]
*  He's an entrepreneur. He graduated Harvard. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, all that kind of stuff. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=73.28s)]
*  He was an entrepreneur, then a capital allocator. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=74.6s)]
*  I think broad strokes. Everybody knows he's a conservative, running as a Republican. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=77.88s)]
*  He's anti woke, he's pro life, anti affirmative action, pro free speech. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=82.88s)]
*  And he wants federal government term limits. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=88.08s)]
*  And his fans are lunatics. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=91.64s)]
*  They've been asking for him to be on the All In podcast every day. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=94.2s)]
*  I've gotten about 300 emails from your fans. Welcome to the program. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  They sound like your fans, actually, because I hear it all the time. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=101.24s)]
*  It's like blaming me for why I have not been on this program. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=104.0s)]
*  And so you guys, this has been like some sort of idealized experience for me. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=106.72s)]
*  Looking forward to it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=110.88s)]
*  OK, great. So what we try to do here is have a real conversation, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=112.0s)]
*  try to get these candidates off their talking points. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=115.96s)]
*  So this isn't meet the press, obviously, want to talk to you like a human being. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  So the extent that, you know, as a politician now, you can talk like a human being. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  The audience and we would appreciate it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=126.19999999999999s)]
*  Meet David Sacks, Chamath Palihapitiya and David Friedberg. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=127.91999999999999s)]
*  All right, Vivek, why don't you explain maybe your background as a capital allocator [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=132.0s)]
*  and as an entrepreneur and then why you chose to run for president at this time? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=136.04s)]
*  Yeah, sure. I mean, my parents, like many people, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=139.96s)]
*  you probably also know who have had similar success stories. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=143.52s)]
*  They came to this country with almost no money. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=146.4s)]
*  I went on to actually found successful companies. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=149.04s)]
*  And so I started my career as a biotech investor. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=152.24s)]
*  I worked at a hedge fund in New York when I graduated in 2007. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=156.32s)]
*  I thought I was going to be a scientist. I studied molecular biology. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  Ended up enjoying my time as an internship. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=163.76s)]
*  It hit a hedge fund a lot more than that. So I did that for seven years. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=166.76s)]
*  Three of those years, I spent law school at the same time. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=170.27999999999997s)]
*  But then when I finished law school, I had, you know, I think felt like my learning curve [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=172.72s)]
*  had flattened from being a pure capital allocator. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  So I stepped down and founded a new kind of biotech company that I could. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=180.44s)]
*  Actually, you guys might be more interested in it than most of my political audiences. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=185.6s)]
*  But the basic premise was give scientists skin in the game, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=189.67999999999998s)]
*  in the projects they actually work on. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=194.11999999999998s)]
*  So if you're a GSK or advisor or whatever, Merck, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=196.4s)]
*  you discover a drug or you develop it, you don't have personal upside [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=200.36s)]
*  in the individual drug that you develop. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=204.4s)]
*  You do have various forms of asymmetric downside. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=207.56s)]
*  And so people don't take risks unless they're the same risks that the other pharma companies are taking, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  because if you take the same risk and fail, but everybody else is failing [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  in a therapeutic category at the same time, you're safe. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=218.28000000000003s)]
*  But if you take a risk that other people aren't willing to take and you fail, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=221.36s)]
*  then you experience budget cuts, maybe job security risks, social embarrassment, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=225.28s)]
*  which is a big factor in big pharma as well, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  which in turn created an opportunity that I took advantage of, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  which was that there were systematically categories of drugs that went undeveloped [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=235.56s)]
*  even after big pharma had for a long time spent a lot of money [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=241.32s)]
*  developing those drugs up to a certain point. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=245.56s)]
*  So I built a business called Roivent, basically in licensed [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=248.4s)]
*  some of those drugs in their early stages of development, phase one or phase two, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=252.08s)]
*  often for pennies on the dollar relative to what had gone into them. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=256.76s)]
*  Often we would have scientists or drug developers who were passionate [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  about that very project inside the companies who would come with those drugs [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=264.32s)]
*  because they wanted to develop them. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  But the big pharma company said that they weren't in that area anymore. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=270.2s)]
*  And we built a pipeline of such drugs. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=274.36s)]
*  The whole plan was some of them would work, some of them wouldn't. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=277.2s)]
*  The successes would make up for the failures. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=279.72s)]
*  And it's now a 10 billion dollar public company. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=282.48s)]
*  And it returned, unlike many private companies, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=284.96s)]
*  returned a billion dollars plus to shareholders before going public. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=287.96s)]
*  And it continues to do well to this day. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=291.12s)]
*  I led the company as CEO for seven years. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=295.6s)]
*  Five of the drugs I worked on are FDA approved today. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=298.12s)]
*  The one I'm probably most proud of is a drug that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  it's actually a biologic that is a life saving therapy in kids. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=304.88s)]
*  Another one's an approved drug for prostate cancer. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=308.35999999999996s)]
*  But that was my world is the point. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  Very different world, maybe more similar to your guys' world [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=313.0s)]
*  now than the world I'm in now. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=316.52s)]
*  Something funny happened in 2020, which was that in my own company, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=319.23999999999995s)]
*  there were demands that I make a statement on behalf of Black Lives Matter. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  After the George Floyd, it was tragic death in May of 2020. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=328.91999999999996s)]
*  By June, there were demands that I start making statements on behalf of BLM. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  And it was a funny time because only starting that February, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=338.4s)]
*  I had ventured into actually exercising my voice as a citizen [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=341.64s)]
*  while being a CEO at my own peril, criticizing what was then [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=345.68s)]
*  the still new shiny object of stakeholder capitalism. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=349.28s)]
*  So I published this piece in The Wall Street Journal and generated some waves [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=353.0s)]
*  that February, a few months later in May, this George Floyd controversy comes up. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=355.44s)]
*  And the long story short, I can go into it if you guys are interested. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=360.52s)]
*  But over the next six months, a series of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=362.88s)]
*  escalating events led me to face a choice the following January of, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=366.59999999999997s)]
*  you know, there's three advisors to my company that stepped down after I wrote [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=371.84s)]
*  a rather I didn't intend it to be, but a rather controversial piece [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=375.28s)]
*  in The Wall Street Journal at the time. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=378.91999999999996s)]
*  What was the promise of the piece? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=380.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, the premise of the piece was that it actually was controversial [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=381.88s)]
*  on numerous counts, but the basic premise was it was the first legal argument [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=385.28s)]
*  anybody had made that if the government is pressuring a private actor [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=388.79999999999995s)]
*  to do something that the government couldn't do directly, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=393.04s)]
*  that that was still state action. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=396.36s)]
*  You know, the subtext is this was in the wake of January 6th, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=398.6s)]
*  where there was widespread systematic censorship of, you know, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=401.6s)]
*  political speech in this country, at least I believe there was. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=404.68s)]
*  And so at the time I made that argument, it was dismissed [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=407.96000000000004s)]
*  as a conspiracy theory on the facts. No, that's not happening. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=409.88s)]
*  It was also dismissed as a legal theory. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=413.12s)]
*  You know, this Rube, who happened to go to law school, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=415.16s)]
*  forgot his first year where the First Amendment only applies to state actors. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=418.48s)]
*  You know, now fast forward three years, two and a half years. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=423.24s)]
*  We now know those facts were far worse than even I envisioned at the time. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=427.72s)]
*  And actually, the legal argument that I made is now popularized [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=431.24s)]
*  by Clarence Thomas and others that are finding its way into our jurisprudence. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=434.16s)]
*  But anyway, three advisors to the company found it so offensive [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=437.88s)]
*  that I would make this argument in public that within 48 hours [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=441.28000000000003s)]
*  of that piece, they resigned. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=444.52000000000004s)]
*  That was definitely a post Jan six mood and reaction [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=445.88s)]
*  that I had to then make a choice. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=450.28000000000003s)]
*  Right. Because now this is having potentially an adverse impact on the company. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=452.16s)]
*  I could either. All right. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=456.08000000000004s)]
*  Call it a year where I experimented with expressing myself and, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=457.44s)]
*  you know, wearing my legal academic hat and call that a day and continue with biotech. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=461.48s)]
*  Or legitimately, if I didn't want to have an adverse impact on my company, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=467.36s)]
*  I could step down and really speak freely. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=470.36s)]
*  I choose to I chose to step down, not in small part, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=473.12s)]
*  because the company was doing great. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=476.04s)]
*  You know, I had a successor lined up, so there was a fortunate [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=477.64000000000004s)]
*  set of circumstances. It happened to be the right time. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=480.2s)]
*  I just had my first son. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=483.24s)]
*  My son, Karthik, was born in February of 2020. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=484.88s)]
*  He was about to turn a year old. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=488.35999999999996s)]
*  We were in a transitional phase of our life. COVID, you know, we were [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=490.8s)]
*  we had a year away from the office. My wife was filling her fellowship. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=493.68s)]
*  There was just a lot going on in her life that it felt like this was [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=496.28s)]
*  a moment for a life transition to focus on. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=499.96s)]
*  You know, a lot of people, talented people developing medicines, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=503.64s)]
*  maybe some of them more talented than me, you know, roving to a successful company. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=506.28s)]
*  Did you feel like you were being bullied into making a statement [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=510.32s)]
*  about Black Mives Matter by your own employees? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=512.64s)]
*  And what's your thought? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=515.24s)]
*  Generally speaking, on companies being politically active [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=517.04s)]
*  and companies having a political voice, because it has come up [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=520.24s)]
*  in our industry over and over again. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=523.16s)]
*  You might know Brian Armstrong from Coinbase said, hey, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=524.84s)]
*  we're here to do crypto. Nothing else. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=527.48s)]
*  Please don't talk about anything political. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=529.68s)]
*  So what are your thoughts generally on that? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=531.28s)]
*  You wrote a whole book on this, right? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=532.72s)]
*  I mean, I read your book and it speaks a lot about the distinction between [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=534.4399999999999s)]
*  what the intention is in optimizing for shareholders [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=539.8399999999999s)]
*  versus the personal interests of the executives and those in charge, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=543.88s)]
*  expressing their personal points of view through the corporation. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=547.3199999999999s)]
*  I think you had some points of view on where that should all go. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=551.1999999999999s)]
*  But was that in part motivating for you to run for public office [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=554.04s)]
*  and why president instead of running for a Senate seat or [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=557.88s)]
*  congressional seat or something else? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=561.36s)]
*  Yeah, so it turns out I've written. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=563.28s)]
*  I wrote three books in the last two years, and two of them are about this topic. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=564.64s)]
*  The first one is Woke Inc, which was for a general audience. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=568.8s)]
*  And then there was a second one called Capitalist Punishment, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=571.1999999999999s)]
*  which was specifically about the ESG strand of this and capital markets. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=573.92s)]
*  And just so people are aware, my general view is that companies should focus [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=578.76s)]
*  on making products and services for people who need them without apologizing for it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=582.56s)]
*  And yes, that's how you maximize profit for shareholders [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=586.8s)]
*  by having a worthy mission and sticking to it without taking on social missions [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=589.72s)]
*  that are best carried out by institutions outside of corporate America. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=593.88s)]
*  I so much believe this, that even before I ran for president, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=598.12s)]
*  this actually does answer your question, Davis. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=600.8399999999999s)]
*  I actually thought the way I was going to have impact based on this. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=603.52s)]
*  I enjoy being an author, but I'm not by nature just an academic. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=606.16s)]
*  I like to do things. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=609.7199999999999s)]
*  I started a company called Strive. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=611.24s)]
*  It's an asset management firm that directly competes [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=613.56s)]
*  against the likes of BlackRock and State Street and Vanguard. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=616.8s)]
*  That's what I thought my next leap was going to be. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=620.36s)]
*  Strive's first fund launched last August. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=623.4399999999999s)]
*  And less than a year and it's close to a billion dollars in assets under management. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=627.4s)]
*  I think it took JP Morgan two years to get to a billion when they got into the ETF business. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=630.88s)]
*  That was what my journey was going to be is within corporate America, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=634.92s)]
*  restore the unapologetic pursuit of excellence over distracting [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=639.12s)]
*  and dilutive political, environmental and social agendas. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=643.8s)]
*  But the thing that struck me, I think late last year and last December, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=648.28s)]
*  last year we had our second son, got a new company off the ground. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=652.64s)]
*  You all know what that entails. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=655.64s)]
*  It was very much an all in experience doing that. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=657.36s)]
*  December, we had some time to take a step back. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=660.68s)]
*  And my wife and I, we [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=663.08s)]
*  kind of take a moment to ask yourself, why are you doing what you're doing? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=666.72s)]
*  It's not a conversation you often have or take time to do. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=669.1999999999999s)]
*  But the question of the why. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=672.96s)]
*  And it reminded me back of that experience I had at Roeven. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=676.6s)]
*  You asked me, did I feel bullied? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=679.08s)]
*  I didn't actually feel bullied. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=681.0s)]
*  I think I could imagine someone in my shoes feeling that way. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=682.72s)]
*  But I didn't feel like it was somebody cornering me to do something [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=685.32s)]
*  I didn't want to do. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=689.36s)]
*  Others have had that experience. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=690.12s)]
*  That wasn't quite how it felt for me. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=691.0400000000001s)]
*  Felt like there's a group of people who followed me on this mission, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=693.88s)]
*  who look up to me, who were disappointed in me, actually. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=696.84s)]
*  And I think that was much harder than feeling like I was being bullied, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=700.9200000000001s)]
*  was to have a group of people who followed me on this worthy mission [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=703.84s)]
*  of developing medicines that pharma companies weren't that felt proud of that mission [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=706.96s)]
*  that now felt disappointed in me. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=710.6800000000001s)]
*  And that was much harder to deal with than the bullying. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=713.52s)]
*  But that also opened my eyes to the fact that I'm here stridently fighting [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=715.96s)]
*  against BlackRock and the ESG industrial complex, which is a little bit of a deflection [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=719.6s)]
*  from the essence of what I actually think is going on at the real root cause, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=724.72s)]
*  especially amongst young people in the country. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=728.6s)]
*  What is that? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=730.6s)]
*  Which is that they and this is what I saw in my employees [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=732.04s)]
*  in the experience I went through. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=735.04s)]
*  So that was formative for me. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=735.96s)]
*  These are good people. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=737.0s)]
*  These are earnest people, many of whom came. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=738.3199999999999s)]
*  It's in many ways is my fault [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=740.68s)]
*  because the pitch that we made in recruiting, we recruited from Harvard and MIT [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=742.44s)]
*  and everywhere else. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=745.8800000000001s)]
*  Big pharma companies didn't recruit out of undergrad. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=746.6800000000001s)]
*  We did. Part of my pitch was, hey, you want to go, you know, to a quant hedge fund [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=748.44s)]
*  and turn that pile of cash into a bigger pile of cash. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=752.9200000000001s)]
*  Or do you want to actually make medicines that impact people's lives [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=754.96s)]
*  and do well that way? So that was part of you and my pitch going in. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=758.2800000000001s)]
*  So we select for a certain kind of person. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=761.08s)]
*  And then they come back and say they're disappointed me for not adopting [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=762.84s)]
*  unrelated social agendas. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=765.5200000000001s)]
*  What dawned on me is that young people in this country, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=768.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm a millennial, you guys are young. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=771.76s)]
*  We're hungry for a cause, right? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=775.04s)]
*  We're so hungry for purpose and meaning. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=777.72s)]
*  And identity. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=783.12s)]
*  And yet we're starving for that at a time in our history [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=785.56s)]
*  when the things that used to fill that void and we can. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=789.2s)]
*  There's a lot of things that could fill that blank. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=792.48s)]
*  I talked about it today at this Constitution camp here in New Hampshire. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=794.24s)]
*  Faith, patriotism, hard work, family. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=797.4s)]
*  But I think there's some truth to what Brian Armstrong told his employees. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=800.72s)]
*  A corporation with a worthy mission can help fill that void, too. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=803.84s)]
*  And I think that's one of the roles that CEOs who feel like they're being [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=807.0s)]
*  bullied might miss is you. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=809.84s)]
*  You don't have people who are bullying you. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=811.52s)]
*  You have people who are lost, who are looking to you for direction and purpose. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=812.72s)]
*  You're saying it quickly, but I think that family and religion are [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=817.2s)]
*  very, very big drivers of a huge. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=820.72s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just saying it quickly because I talk about that all the time. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=823.28s)]
*  But but I think the family and faith is. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=825.6s)]
*  I mean, these are foundational building blocks. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=829.48s)]
*  They're foundational. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=831.4s)]
*  I think that when you look statistically at like the decay [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=832.28s)]
*  in the number of young people who are religious or the decay [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=835.08s)]
*  in the number of young people who actually have, you know, two parent families, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=838.92s)]
*  all of this speaks to the fact that the social norms that gave people purpose [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=843.72s)]
*  have actually gone, but they haven't been replaced with anything else. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=848.52s)]
*  And I think that's the vacuum that you're seeing [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=851.48s)]
*  that many of these young people fall into. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=854.16s)]
*  And so they're looking for something to your point. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=856.6s)]
*  And the problem with that is not the causes themselves, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=858.9200000000001s)]
*  but the fact that they are short lived. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=864.08s)]
*  And then what's left over is the need for more and more and more. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=865.9200000000001s)]
*  And that escalation, I think, is very dangerous if you think about where, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=869.64s)]
*  you know, society goes to from here. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=873.12s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with you on that. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=874.88s)]
*  And that's why I have been characterized. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=876.0400000000001s)]
*  And Jason introduced me that way, too, as anti-woke. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=878.84s)]
*  I don't actually think of my I don't I don't like that label because [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=882.52s)]
*  it's not inaccurate. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=886.6s)]
*  I don't like it because it's false. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=888.16s)]
*  I think it misses the point where I think the way we actually combat [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=890.4s)]
*  fill in your favorite blanket, woke ism, climatism, covid ism, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=895.48s)]
*  fentanyl usage, anxiety, depression, loss of self-confidence. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=900.2s)]
*  These things are symptoms of a deeper void of purpose and meaning. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=904.0400000000001s)]
*  And so I don't think you help the matter much by. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=908.0400000000001s)]
*  And I've done some of this. I will admit this, right? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=911.24s)]
*  I'm not blaming other people. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=913.72s)]
*  Well, I mean, but the book, the book, I don't have you read the book, Jason, or not? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=915.72s)]
*  I haven't yet, but I will. OK. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=918.4s)]
*  The book is it was it was titled and written before the word [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=920.2s)]
*  weapon woke took on its current political valence. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=924.52s)]
*  Yeah, I will say that. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=927.24s)]
*  OK. Many people didn't know what the word woke was at the time. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=928.64s)]
*  I title was fairly revelatory when you came out and used that word in your in your title. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=931.24s)]
*  It was like, let me reveal to you a little bit about what this thing [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=936.1600000000001s)]
*  that I'm calling woke is turning into, which is a more broader kind of. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=939.4s)]
*  Social, psychological issue that we're all grappling with, right? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=943.48s)]
*  How it's now leached its way into politics, it's leached its way into nonprofits, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=948.16s)]
*  it's leached its way into corporate America, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=951.9200000000001s)]
*  into for profits, into the military, into government, et cetera. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=956.4s)]
*  Obviously, since that was published, it has now become this hot term [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=959.84s)]
*  that has different meaning for different people, and it can be pretty exciting in terms of [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=964.8000000000001s)]
*  how people react to it. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=969.2s)]
*  You saying that, Dave? Yeah, I appreciate you saying that, Dave, because [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=970.32s)]
*  my net prescription is actually we dilute not just woke ism. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=972.64s)]
*  I mean, that's just part of the story. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=976.24s)]
*  We dilute secular religions, the rise of secular religions. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=977.92s)]
*  Right. And I don't call them even religions because religion has withstood the test of time. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=981.88s)]
*  A cult has not. But the rise of modern secular cults, we dilute them to irrelevance [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=986.0s)]
*  by filling that void with an alternative vision. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=991.4399999999999s)]
*  And so, you know, if one political camp might offer race and gender and sexuality and climate, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=994.1999999999999s)]
*  as a prescription for the void, I think where conservatives fall badly short [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1001.52s)]
*  is by simply being anti those things without actually offering an alternative vision of our own. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1007.12s)]
*  And I am aiming certainly to do that in this campaign. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1014.64s)]
*  If you were going to replace race and gender and these kind of things, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1017.44s)]
*  what would be your qualities or things to focus on? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1021.6800000000001s)]
*  So let's do like a little face off, right? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1027.6000000000001s)]
*  Individually talking about race, gender, sexuality, climate. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1030.32s)]
*  I pair them up against individual family nation God. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1034.32s)]
*  OK. And I think that there's a substantive vision here. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1039.04s)]
*  I think America happened to have been founded on the latter vision, not the former. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1042.3999999999999s)]
*  So if I'm running for U.S. president, I think that that already tilts the scales in favor of this [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1045.36s)]
*  vision because it so happens as a historical matter, America was grounded on some people will [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1049.4399999999998s)]
*  contest this. But I think on that vision rather than the genetic and climate based one. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1054.32s)]
*  But I think that that's something where the Republican Party and conservatives have fallen [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1059.6799999999998s)]
*  short. That's part of what your question is and pulled me into this is I saw the emergence of [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1062.56s)]
*  what was likely to be a biographical brawl between two guys who are the front runners or whatever. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1068.0s)]
*  You know, that's not productive. But I think more importantly than a biographical brawl, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1074.08s)]
*  even the question about who we are, I think the Republican Party and the conservative movement [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1077.6799999999998s)]
*  was in many ways defining itself in opposition to that alternative vision of identity, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1082.96s)]
*  where what I want to do, what I'm striving to do and I hope we're doing, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1086.88s)]
*  is actually offering an affirmative vision of our own that go to the heart of what it means [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1090.56s)]
*  to be an American. And, you know, I don't think that national identity alone is going to fill [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1095.52s)]
*  that vacuum fully. But I think it makes a pretty good darn stride forward. And I think those roles [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1100.56s)]
*  for pastors and others, that's beyond my pay grade. And so I'm not I'm not purporting to do [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1106.32s)]
*  that in this campaign. I speak to it, but that's that's going to be the role of people in a higher [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1111.12s)]
*  calling than being US president. But I think the next US president can play a meaningful role in [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1115.76s)]
*  filling that vacuum, at least when it comes to national identity. And so that's really what this [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1121.04s)]
*  campaign is about. It's not it's not anti woke. It is unapologetically nationalist in a certain [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1125.52s)]
*  sense of that word. Nationalist in the sense of embracing those ideals that set this nation into [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1131.6799999999998s)]
*  motion that still unite us across those genetically inherited attributes that we've otherwise [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1138.24s)]
*  celebrated over the last 10 years. To say you believe in American exceptionalism. And that's [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1143.52s)]
*  that's your platform for that is my platform. That is absolutely my platform, the exceptionalism of [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1148.0s)]
*  the ideals that set this country into motion. Absolutely. So Vivek, let me ask a question [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1152.4s)]
*  around where we are in the cycle of the American experiment, where we have obviously allowed the [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1158.16s)]
*  throttle to be full forward. And as a result, we've seen extraordinary progress emerge from [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1167.68s)]
*  the entrepreneurial talents and the drive of the people of this country for the past 250 years. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1172.88s)]
*  And it's really extraordinary in a transformed human civilization. We now find ourselves, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1178.3200000000002s)]
*  particularly over the past 50 years as this problem has gotten worse, with increasing disparity [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1183.6000000000001s)]
*  between the haves and the have nots, or those who believe they they have not, which is nearly [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1189.3600000000001s)]
*  everyone. Everyone now has some point of view that they have not got something. And they see [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1194.72s)]
*  other people that do have something that they do not. And this inequality and this perception [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1199.2s)]
*  of inequality, both with respect to absolute amounts of capital, income, earnings, and these [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1204.24s)]
*  perception issues have now driven a populist movement in this country that we have seen [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1209.52s)]
*  historically, many times in the past, different countries that ultimately turn into either [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1214.08s)]
*  socialist nations or fascist nations. In all cases, some sort of autocratic regime [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1220.4s)]
*  seems to have emerged because of this populist movement that we're now seeing not just in the [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1227.36s)]
*  US but across the West. Do you feel like we're at that moment in the US? And one of the manifestations [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1231.92s)]
*  of that, I'll say, is government spending, because everyone demands more from their government and [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1238.56s)]
*  the government steps up and the elected officials that they elect step up and spend more and it [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1243.28s)]
*  layers and it layers and layers. And we now have a $33 trillion debt load. And we have a $1.5 trillion [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1247.52s)]
*  annual deficit. And by many projections, Social Security will be bankrupt in anywhere from 10 to [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1253.84s)]
*  15 years, 10 to 20 years, whatever numbers you want to use. The CBO assumes we're going to have [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1258.72s)]
*  unsustainable spiraling debt. What is your point of view on where we are in the cycle, how it's [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1264.24s)]
*  manifesting today, and how we're going to deal with the fiscal issues that arise from these movements? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1269.44s)]
*  Yeah, so I think where we are in the cycle, I don't take that as a passive law of physics. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1274.24s)]
*  I think that who runs this country and leads this country can make an actual difference in the actual [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1281.6799999999998s)]
*  underlying course of that so-called cycle, which is part of what pulls me into this. So I'm a little [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1288.0s)]
*  bit unconventional on my views on the debt load and the entitlement spending in this country and [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1292.3999999999999s)]
*  our first step in our way out of it. I don't think we're in a place of having remotely enough [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1299.76s)]
*  consensus or trust. And I think trust is probably the more important word than consensus. To begin [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1306.08s)]
*  just snip, snip, make cuts to what people feel like they were entitled to and promised, especially [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1311.2s)]
*  in a moment where we're beginning with deep distrust that will take what you call those populist [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1316.72s)]
*  flames and throw kerosene on it. I'm more optimistic about this, and I think this is quite realistic [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1321.28s)]
*  actually, is that the next leap forward is we can grow our way out of, I'm not going to say all, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1327.1999999999998s)]
*  but most of our actual pending fiscal calamity. This year, I think right now, the last six months, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1333.12s)]
*  we're talking less than 1.5% annualized GDP growth, what we're averaging right now. For most of our [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1340.4799999999998s)]
*  national history, we've actually grown at over 4% plus GDP growth. Certainly, if you go back to the [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1346.1599999999999s)]
*  pre-gold standard period, and even after going off the gold standard, we had a relatively stable US [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1350.8799999999999s)]
*  dollar, and I am one of these weird guys who believes that the Fed should have a single mandate [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1355.84s)]
*  of dollar stability without playing the Phillips curve game. But anyway, put that sidetrack to one [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1360.48s)]
*  side, we've grown at 3%, 4% GDP growth for most of our national history, even relatively recent [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1367.28s)]
*  national history. And I don't think it's a complicated path to get back there. I think things [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1373.12s)]
*  we need to do, unlock American energy. We talk about secular religions, I view the climate cult [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1378.56s)]
*  as one of those secular religions. Drill, frack. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1384.48s)]
*  What would your specific energy plan be? Completely unlock the permitting process [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1387.3600000000001s)]
*  that they've used as a backdoor mechanism to shut down American energy production. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1392.72s)]
*  Drilling, fracking, burning coal. Coal should not be a four-letter word, embracing nuclear energy. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1396.48s)]
*  Later tonight, after we're having this conversation, this evening, I'm going to be at [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1401.84s)]
*  St. Anselm College laying out my detail. It's going to be like a giant poster, laying out the anatomy [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1405.04s)]
*  of how I will shut down the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which has been a fundamentally [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1411.12s)]
*  hostile administrative agency to the existence of nuclear power in this country. Actually, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1416.0s)]
*  even to the detriment of actually making sure that we are getting our nuclear energy from Gen 2, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1422.2399999999998s)]
*  rather than Gen 3 or Gen 4 reactors. But that'll be for tonight. It's an all of the above approach [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1426.56s)]
*  of unshackling ourselves to produce energy here in the United States. To your point about, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1432.08s)]
*  David made a good point earlier about the addiction of paying people more from the [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1438.48s)]
*  federal government. That becomes the status quo if that's your voter base. That's not even good [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1443.92s)]
*  in many cases for the people who are giving that money, too. I think we should stop paying people [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1447.68s)]
*  to stay at home when actually the top obstacle for many businesses to grow, you guys will know this [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1452.16s)]
*  well, is filling vacant job openings. That is an obstacle to GDP growth, is paying people more to [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1457.52s)]
*  stay at home than many of them earn to go back to work. Do you think that the IRA was good [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1465.76s)]
*  legislation? I don't have, it's not like the horse that I'm going to ride, right? In terms of the [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1471.6s)]
*  main, I'm going to pin everything on it. But I mostly don't think it was great legislation. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1480.64s)]
*  Where are you coming from on that? Because we might have different reasons. If you think about [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1486.8799999999999s)]
*  what the IRA does for energy, and frankly, if you just roll up the BIL chips in IRA, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1491.04s)]
*  I'm just curious your thoughts on whether government incentives are moving in that direction [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1496.96s)]
*  that you actually support, or you still think it's missing something? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1502.8s)]
*  So one of the things that I actually focus on, and I think is really important, is what can the U.S. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1507.6s)]
*  President actually do? I mean, President Trump's, I don't know if people remember this, his main [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1514.8799999999999s)]
*  policy promise was actually repeal and replace Obamacare, which never happened because it [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1520.88s)]
*  required going through Congress. So I'm actually focused on elements that I can deliver on [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1524.48s)]
*  without asking Congress either for permission or forgiveness. And so that's why my answer to Jason [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1529.8400000000001s)]
*  was I go straight to at least let's focus on actually the administrative state, which on my [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1534.64s)]
*  reading of the Constitution reports in to the single duly elected president. So when I talk [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1538.88s)]
*  about the permitting process at the Department of Interior, or shutting down the Nuclear Regulatory [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1543.28s)]
*  Commission, I believe in, you know, we could go, I'm going into details on it tonight. I have the [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1547.2s)]
*  legal authority to do that as the U.S. President. I think the legislation is going to be much more [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1552.4s)]
*  complicated, and I don't believe that I can be in a position to promise what we would do legislatively [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1556.48s)]
*  to any of that. You mentioned getting people to take all these jobs that are available. Do you want [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1562.64s)]
*  to talk about immigration for a second and what you think about that? Yeah, merit-based immigration. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1569.44s)]
*  Before you go right to immigration, would you, are you saying you would cut entitlements like [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1574.32s)]
*  unemployment or shorten the unemployment period to force people to go back to work? Is that [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1578.3999999999999s)]
*  what I'm reading? And tie them to work requirements. Absolutely. Yeah. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1582.6399999999999s)]
*  Would you have a specific for that? Like a certain number of months or, you know, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1586.56s)]
*  Yeah, you're a pretty good, a pretty good, I mean, I do, but I think that's again, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1590.24s)]
*  I'm very clear about what I will do through executive authority. What needs to go through [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1594.48s)]
*  legislation? I mean, that's all a negotiation, but I think a good principle is 1996 or in [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1598.72s)]
*  1990s workfare under Clinton was actually far more aggressive than the work environment, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1603.84s)]
*  work requirements that were put into this supposed Republican led debt deal where, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1610.08s)]
*  like, what did they say? It was, if you're age 18 to 55 and you are able-bodied and childless, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1615.9199999999998s)]
*  then you have to work at least 20 hours a week in order to receive more than three months out of [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1623.84s)]
*  three years worth of welfare. Right. Joe Biden as a US Senator voted for actually much more [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1630.32s)]
*  stringent workfare requirements in the 90s. So, you know, yes, I have ideas on specifics, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1637.84s)]
*  but I'm not going to make a promise on exactly what that specific will look like. But a guiding [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1642.24s)]
*  principle is it has to be at least as aggressive as what we have done. I mean, during Clinton, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1645.52s)]
*  we had 69, almost 70% participation and we're at 60 now, I think. So it's obvious that we have to [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1650.32s)]
*  trim that. But to Chamath's next point, you know, we have 10 million job openings. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1657.2s)]
*  We're not letting anybody in. How would you look at immigration? Obviously, we have people coming [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1661.04s)]
*  in the southern border illegally, and then we have H-1B visas, and now Canada is saying, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1665.52s)]
*  hey, we'll steal all those H-1Bs. We'll take them. So how do you look at immigration to Chamath's [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1670.4s)]
*  question? Merit-based immigration. I mean, one of the things that Canada does have, and I'm not [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1674.8s)]
*  a fan of America imitating Canada or anything like this in most respects, but they do have a [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1679.3600000000001s)]
*  point-based system, right? They have a point-based system. And so I think the point-based system [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1684.16s)]
*  should work differently in the U.S., but I do favor merit-based immigration. I'm a little bit [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1689.1200000000001s)]
*  of a departure from what I think is the Republican consensus here. You know, people I respect, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1695.0400000000002s)]
*  Tom Cotton and others have proposed bills with a hard cap on the number of immigrants. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1699.68s)]
*  I think it's a mistake. I think that the cap should declare itself based on how many people [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1704.24s)]
*  meet the meritocratic criteria. What are the top qualities then for what would be your [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1708.88s)]
*  top criteria in this point-based system? Two criteria. Skills that match up to job openings [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1714.0s)]
*  in the United States, but secondarily, and this one's important to me, I would move the civics [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1718.16s)]
*  portion of becoming a citizen to the front end of even being granted a visa to enter this country. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1725.52s)]
*  And I think that addresses and accommodates an important part of the concern that many people [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1731.68s)]
*  who are pro-immigration cap actually favor is I think there are legitimate concerns about the [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1737.2s)]
*  dilution, the loss of a national identity, but a lot of that is conflated with first the cycle of [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1741.84s)]
*  illegal immigration. I'm a hardliner on this. I favor putting the U.S. military on the southern [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1747.28s)]
*  border. I've said I would use it on the northern border. I believe that we are on strong constitutional [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1752.56s)]
*  and legal authority to do it. I do not think building the wall was enough. There are cartel [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1757.6799999999998s)]
*  finance tunnels underneath that wall that vehicles literally run through today, so in some ways I'm [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1762.32s)]
*  going further than Trump in this direction, but simultaneously debureaucratize, speed up the process [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1766.8s)]
*  for merit-based immigration, but part of merit includes not just skills, but also civic commitments [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1773.9199999999998s)]
*  to the country. And I'm, you know, I used the word nationalist before. I know that scares some people. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1782.8s)]
*  I mean it in a positive way. I think every high school student in this country should have to [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1787.44s)]
*  pass the same civics test that an immigrant has to pass in order to become a citizen of this country. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1793.6s)]
*  I also would favor bringing that on the front end, and it selects for the kind of people who [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1799.6s)]
*  know something about the country when they enter, which I think is a good thing. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1803.28s)]
*  So you believe people should assimilate and they should love this country in order to come into the country? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1806.24s)]
*  Yes, I do. I think you should want to come here to be an American. Yeah. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1810.8799999999999s)]
*  I think that's good. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1814.9599999999998s)]
*  I think you need to get agreement around the horn here. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1815.52s)]
*  Sax, you've heard Vivek's position so far. You obviously are passionate about the GOP. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1818.4s)]
*  What do you agree with and what don't you agree with so far? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1824.8s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of stuff to agree with there. We're talking about American exceptionalism. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1826.8s)]
*  One thing I want to talk about there is that I agree that America is exceptional and we're [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1830.4s)]
*  most exceptional when we're trying to set an example for other nations, when we're trying [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1837.92s)]
*  to be the shining city on a hill, as Reagan put it. But lately, and really, I mean over the last [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1841.76s)]
*  couple of decades, what you've seen is that what American exceptionalism means to a lot of people [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1847.84s)]
*  in Washington is that we run all over the world and impose our ideology and our values on all these [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1853.76s)]
*  different countries. We began this great crusade to try and spread democracy in the Middle East. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1860.4s)]
*  We tried to turn countries like Afghanistan and Iraq into Madisonian democracies. We now are very, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1865.44s)]
*  very involved in Ukraine, basically trying to detach that country from the Russian sphere [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1874.24s)]
*  of influence and turning it into a member of our military and economic alliance. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1880.64s)]
*  It does seem like American exceptionalism has taken on this harder, more militarized edge. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1886.48s)]
*  Where would you draw the line? What makes sense to you? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1893.2s)]
*  I basically agree with everything you just said. I think as a side note on the geopolitics of it, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1899.28s)]
*  I do think Ukraine is on track to become potentially the next Vietnam or the next Iraq. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1903.2s)]
*  I think you have said similar things. I also think there's something else going on with Ukraine [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1907.3600000000001s)]
*  that's fueling this, which relates to the deeper identity crisis in our country that I described [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1912.72s)]
*  earlier. I think Ukraine has become a new religion in the country and it's a substitute for purpose [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1918.16s)]
*  and meaning just like climate ideology or wokeism is. There's the flag. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1924.16s)]
*  It's like a crusade. You have people waving these. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1928.5600000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. You go to Washington, D.C., at least I did in June. I was there for one of the Sunday [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1931.68s)]
*  shows where my wife and I are going for a walk. We saw more trans flags and Ukraine flags than we did [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1936.24s)]
*  American flags on a short walk that we took through Washington, D.C., our nation's capital. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1941.92s)]
*  I'm not whining about this or being histrionic about it. I just think getting to the essence [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1947.1200000000001s)]
*  of what's going on, I think that's a different element of Ukraine that's different from even [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1952.0s)]
*  what we saw with Vietnam or Iraq. I don't think American exceptionalism is foisting our values [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1957.6s)]
*  onto anyone. I think American exceptionalism is about demonstrating through our example [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1962.56s)]
*  how America flourishes and is strong when we live by our own ideals. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1968.32s)]
*  I think the best way we give hope to the free world is by being that shining city on a hill, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1973.36s)]
*  not going somewhere else and talking about it with tanks behind us while actually suffering here at [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1978.8799999999999s)]
*  home. If you roam the streets of Kensington, as I did a few weeks ago, you don't have to go to [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1984.6399999999999s)]
*  Baghdad to see the third world. That, I think, is a big loss of where we are today in the country. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1990.8799999999999s)]
*  When you're president, Putin invades Ukraine, you would sit back, not give any armaments, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=1997.52s)]
*  and let him roll in. Here's what I would do. I would actually be proactive in doing a deal, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2001.92s)]
*  and I've been very clear about the deal I would do. Trump has said he would do a deal in 24 hours, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2007.2s)]
*  he hasn't said what it was. I believe there is a deal to be done, but I also believe it's important [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2012.0800000000002s)]
*  to be clear about what the contours of that deal would be. I would freeze the current line. Let's [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2016.48s)]
*  take the status quo right now. So I can answer your question or I could answer starting from the [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2022.48s)]
*  present. If you don't ... We could do both. I mean, the obvious is maybe put NATO, take NATO off [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2027.2s)]
*  the table and avoid the whole thing, but now we're playing alternative history. So maybe it's better [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2033.2s)]
*  to talk about what's happening now. Yeah, so let's start from the present, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2038.48s)]
*  right? Because I don't think that we would have ... If I was president, I don't think we would [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2040.16s)]
*  have gotten to the point of those things rolling in. Angela Merkel made some disastrous comments, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2042.88s)]
*  Putin made a hard demand. We would have said hard no to Ukraine joining NATO, and that would have [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2046.96s)]
*  been that. There would have been no tanks rolling in. And Putin may have still ... Maybe if we took [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2051.44s)]
*  NATO off the table, Putin may have still invaded. We don't know. I don't think so, but we can't ... [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2054.16s)]
*  Those are counterfactuals that we can ... Exactly. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2058.64s)]
*  We're not going to have one side or the other being able to prove that, right? So let's talk [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2061.2799999999997s)]
*  about the present. Right now, let's say I'm US president, I would freeze the current lines of [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2066.56s)]
*  control. We have a precedent for doing this, the Korean War. Korean War-style armistice. That does [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2072.56s)]
*  give Putin most of the Donbass region. That's beyond the pale of what many are willing to accept [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2078.16s)]
*  in either party, but I think any deal, someone has to win. Everyone has to win something out of the [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2084.72s)]
*  deal. I would further than give that assurance that NATO will not admit Ukraine to NATO, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2089.12s)]
*  but there's a requirement in return. The biggest requirement is that Russia has to exit its military [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2095.2799999999997s)]
*  partnership with China. There's a 2001 treaty. It's called the Treaty of Good Neighborliness [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2101.6s)]
*  and Cooperation, military cooperation between the two countries, that Xi Jinping and Putin [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2106.72s)]
*  ratcheted up to the so-called strategic no limits partnership in 2022. That is why China's now coming, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2111.4399999999996s)]
*  by the way, to Russia's aid. I personally believe we are absolutely sending Putin into Xi Jinping's [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2118.9599999999996s)]
*  arms in a way that's a mistake. I would also require that Putin remove his nuclear weapons [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2125.7599999999998s)]
*  from Kaliningrad, that we take any Russian military presence in the US, in the Western [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2131.52s)]
*  Hemisphere off the table, Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua. I think this is a deal that Putin [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2135.6s)]
*  would do if we paired it with reopening economic relations with Russia, which I would do, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2141.12s)]
*  because I think Putin does not, and I can give you some evidence for this, but I think Putin [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2145.8399999999997s)]
*  does not enjoy being Xi Jinping's little brother. I think that this is actually an opportunity, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2149.44s)]
*  and I have to confess, I am a guy who sees our foreign policy prism through the prism of believing [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2154.24s)]
*  that China is the top long run threat that we face. Most of my foreign policy views and national [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2159.76s)]
*  security views, even on topics that are apparently unrelated to China, I still see it through that [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2166.2400000000002s)]
*  prism, but this one isn't a far leap because China's literally in a military treaty with Russia [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2170.88s)]
*  and coming to their aid. I would use the Ukraine War and an end to the Ukraine War as a way to [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2174.7200000000003s)]
*  bifurcate the Russia-China relationship and basically dissolve that relationship. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2182.2400000000002s)]
*  And then actually, that's our best way and most effective step towards deterring Xi Jinping [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2188.88s)]
*  from going after Taiwan, because right now Xi Jinping, I think that there's a mistaken consensus [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2194.48s)]
*  view that the way he thinks about it is, oh, reason by analogy rather than by actual analyzing [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2200.48s)]
*  of a situation. Say, oh, well, he got that piece of land, maybe I can go get this island. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2205.84s)]
*  I don't think he reasons by analogy. I think he reasons by the cards he has in terms of hard power. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2209.6s)]
*  So his bet is that the US won't want to go to war with two different allied nuclear superpowers [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2215.84s)]
*  at the same time. But if Russia is no longer in his camp, then Xi Jinping is going to have to [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2222.0s)]
*  think twice about going after Taiwan. So then I guess my broader Taiwan, the obvious follow-up [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2227.36s)]
*  question there is you wouldn't defend Ukraine. Would you have America and the allies defend [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2231.92s)]
*  Taiwan if it was invaded? I would, at least until the US has achieved semiconductor independence. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2237.0400000000004s)]
*  So you wouldn't defend Taiwan. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2243.04s)]
*  Because we depend on them for our modern way of life in a way that we don't on Ukraine. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2245.28s)]
*  And then the latter part of this is, it sounds a little crass to some people, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2249.2s)]
*  but I believe in being honest. I actually think that, yeah, I'll get to this point in a second, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2252.72s)]
*  but to answer your question, yes, until we've achieved semiconductor independence. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2258.4s)]
*  I believe we can achieve semiconductor independence. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2264.08s)]
*  Yeah. So it's not, your belief is not, hey, these are two democracies. They both deserve [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2266.0s)]
*  equal defense from the United States, Ukraine and Taiwan. Ukraine doesn't have semiconductors. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2271.36s)]
*  We don't have a strategic need to defend them in Taiwan. So it's a lot more of a pragmatic [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2276.4s)]
*  cutthroat approach to foreign policy. It is. I, of course, resist the characterization [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2280.88s)]
*  of cutthroat a little bit. I go back to the principle that David mentioned of what American [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2288.0s)]
*  exceptionalism is to me is that when America is strong and is flourishing and Americans are [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2292.2400000000002s)]
*  flourishing within America, we set the example for the free world of what is possible. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2299.2s)]
*  And so my view is that, yes, at least until time, until we're semiconductor self-sufficient. And I [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2304.8799999999997s)]
*  think things work out here where I think we can get there. So in five years where we've got our [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2309.9199999999996s)]
*  semiconductors up and running, you'll let China roll into Taiwan. No big deal for you. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2315.8399999999997s)]
*  I will say that I definitely evaluate that very differently than I do. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2320.72s)]
*  That's super candid, Sachs. Your thoughts on that? Or Freeburn? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2326.88s)]
*  Yeah. Let me just ask. So Vivek, I mean, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2332.08s)]
*  I think that your point is a really important one, which is that when we're happy at home, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2337.6s)]
*  we tend not to look for conflict abroad. That's almost a universal truth that's emerged from [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2341.84s)]
*  history. Human civilization has shown that when the people in a democracy in particular are happy [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2349.84s)]
*  at home, and certainly autocracies are quite different. Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2358.08s)]
*  Augustus Caesar, you go through history. But when you have a true democracy, you don't vote to go [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2364.08s)]
*  and you don't support the idea of conflict abroad if you're happy at home. But the counter is true, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2369.04s)]
*  which is when you're unhappy at home, you tend to look for conflict abroad. And by some assessments, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2374.48s)]
*  Ray Dalio had this great book about this, The Changing World Order. I don't know if you read it, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2379.68s)]
*  but he makes this point about the internal strife leads to external conflict, which is why it felt [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2386.16s)]
*  like we were going to go that way with Ukraine, Russia coming out of 21. So I wonder, are we happy [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2391.44s)]
*  at home? I want to ask another question tied to this. Why is Donald Trump leading in the polls? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2398.24s)]
*  Because I think that the two go hand in hand. There is something that he represents, and there's [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2406.48s)]
*  something about his voice that I think echoes the sentiment of this populist unhappiness inside of [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2411.2s)]
*  this country today that manifests in a bunch of ways, one of which is the interest in and support [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2418.0s)]
*  for external conflict. But I don't know if you're up for kind of thinking about tackling the two [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2423.7599999999998s)]
*  questions together, but I love your take on that. Yeah. Great question. I think you're [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2427.7599999999998s)]
*  absolutely right. I mean, you're extending a theme of where I talk about sort of domestic [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2433.12s)]
*  cultural annoyances as a symptom of a deeper vacuum in our national soul. I think that actually our [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2437.68s)]
*  projection and focus abroad is a lot easier of a deflection away from the harder step of taking [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2445.12s)]
*  a long, hard look in the mirror and asking ourselves about the health of our own nation [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2451.68s)]
*  today. And so I think that's a deep question. I think we're not healthy as a nation today. I [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2456.7999999999997s)]
*  think we suffer from deep-seated psychic insecurities, psychological insecurities. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2462.0s)]
*  I think the economic stagnation, the fact that real wage growth isn't up for the bottom 99% [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2466.64s)]
*  of the country. A lot of that I put at the feet of the Federal Reserve. There are a lot of other [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2470.8799999999997s)]
*  complex factors behind it, but a lot of this feeds into what you call populism. I don't, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2475.04s)]
*  excuse me, I don't use that word. I don't like the term you use, by the way, just to be clear. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2482.48s)]
*  I think that it's just imprecise. It's a rapper that tries to catch too many things and it doesn't [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2485.12s)]
*  catch any of them enough. So yeah. Yeah. You think what you're calling populism is actually a failure [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2490.0s)]
*  of our elites. Isn't that what's going on? We saw during COVID that all the health authorities did [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2495.6s)]
*  a horrible job, the CDC and the NIH. It turns out they were funding function research, which may [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2500.96s)]
*  have caused COVID in the first place. They were doing experiments on bat viruses. Almost certainly [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2506.7999999999997s)]
*  did cause. Yeah, exactly. So, you know, we keep finding out that the elites are supposed to be [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2512.0s)]
*  running the country and running these institutions are doing absolutely horrible job. That's what the [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2517.36s)]
*  reaction is against. Then people come along and label it populism and say, it's going to lead to [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2521.52s)]
*  fascism. It's like, come on, that is a way of protecting the people in power from accountability [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2525.92s)]
*  for the horrible job they're doing. It's well said. Absolutely. And the use of the word populism is [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2532.24s)]
*  almost stacking that debate in favor of saying that those grievances aren't legitimate. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2538.48s)]
*  And so I think why is Donald Trump pulling it number one in the polls? Because people know the [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2543.84s)]
*  truth. I think those grievances are absolutely legitimate. Now, I think the mood of the country [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2549.92s)]
*  has changed a little bit, including the mood of the hard conservative base has changed since 2015. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2555.28s)]
*  I think there is now, I think there is now a sense that what are we actually going to do about it? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2561.92s)]
*  Are we going to go the direction of a national divorce? Divorce is one of these things that [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2566.88s)]
*  speaks itself into existence, maybe applies at the same level of a nation, right? That's on the table. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2571.6s)]
*  It's in the ether. I don't think most people, including in our hardcore America first base, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2576.96s)]
*  I'm part of that base, I don't think want a national divorce. And so I think that the moment [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2583.68s)]
*  now calls for this is why I'm in this race. This is actually why at this point, I couldn't have told [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2590.48s)]
*  you this in March, but at this point, I'm convinced we're actually going to be successful in this. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2594.56s)]
*  This is what the unique fusion we're going to require is not somebody showing up saying hope, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2600.0s)]
*  kumbaya, let's move forward, compromise, hold hands and declare its morning again in America. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2604.32s)]
*  No, that ain't going to work. But I think it requires recognizing the legitimacy of those [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2610.24s)]
*  grievances, not as lip service. I believe for the same reason, Saxon has mentioned many of those [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2615.6s)]
*  grievances are legitimate. They're grounded in truth. But to say, as I often say to the left, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2621.2s)]
*  hardship is not the same thing as victimhood. And we're not going to choose victimhood. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2627.8399999999997s)]
*  We're going to choose recognition of truth as our best path to heal over whatever's happened and then [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2632.3999999999996s)]
*  to move forward. That's why I've come out and been very vocal about the fact that I would pardon [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2638.48s)]
*  Trump of each of the two indictments that have already been brought. And if the J six indictment [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2642.56s)]
*  is brought against him, I would do the same thing. I think that we have to be able to recognize the [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2646.64s)]
*  truth of our past grievances of our fellow Americans and actually not just pay lip service to it, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2652.56s)]
*  but feel into it and acknowledge the reality of them. I think that's then the table stakes of [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2661.04s)]
*  then meeting a demand that many in our grassroots conservative base have. I'm one of them, a desire [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2665.6s)]
*  to also move forward as one nation. And I think both of those elements are going to be required. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2672.24s)]
*  They don't go together. I think there are people in the Republican primary who offer [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2676.32s)]
*  each of those on their own. Yeah. I think whoever's successful can have to offer both. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2680.7200000000003s)]
*  This morning, there was a an opinion piece, I'm assuming you read it by Rich Lowry, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2686.1600000000003s)]
*  chief of the national review, published on Politico, get ready for the Vivek Ramaswamy moment in which [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2692.2400000000002s)]
*  I would say he's fairly effusive about the campaign you're running. Right. I mean, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2699.28s)]
*  would you agree? Like, if you said, yeah, there was a really, yeah, some really, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2703.12s)]
*  did you read the piece? I mean, I thought there was some really, I said, abusive, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2707.92s)]
*  he loves you. Yeah. No, he said, he doesn't love me. Actually, he doesn't love you. But he said, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2712.3199999999997s)]
*  I think he said some complimentary things about your campaign, about your character, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2716.72s)]
*  but said there's no way you're going to win and win for president. Well, you went from under 1%. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2720.88s)]
*  I think now the latest poll has you above 5%. And we're in the very early innings here. Right. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2725.44s)]
*  I think there's one that just came. I mean, yeah, there's some that have, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2730.56s)]
*  you know, bounced a little higher than that. But yeah, you're a little higher before the first [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2732.88s)]
*  debate. The thing that Vivek's done, let me just state this on observer, and then you can react to [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2735.6800000000003s)]
*  it, is that you have kind of inserted yourself in the debate on every issue, you know, every day as [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2739.52s)]
*  it comes up. I mean, you're kind of living off the land as a candidate, not out there with just kind [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2747.52s)]
*  of a traditional stump speech, but you're finding a way to insert yourself into the debate every day [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2752.56s)]
*  on social media. I see it, right? I mean, you post a tweet that will hit the nerve of whatever [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2758.24s)]
*  the issue is going viral that day, which means that you'll go viral. And so for months, I've been [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2764.3199999999997s)]
*  seeing your tweets go super viral. And so it's not surprising to me that your candidacy is starting [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2769.6s)]
*  to, you know, catch on in that way. What's remarkable to me is that other candidates can't do it. I mean, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2776.8799999999997s)]
*  when you first started doing it, I was kind of like, okay, this is obvious and easy. Of course, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2782.24s)]
*  this is what you would do, but other candidates have not really done that for whatever reason. So [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2786.16s)]
*  I mean, am I? I think my perspective, I think my perspective on that, because if we use the normal [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2791.52s)]
*  like it is when you accuse us of creating a banking crisis, but other than that, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2796.56s)]
*  I do want to close the loop on that one. You can either do it on air or off actually. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2802.0s)]
*  No, do it right now. Let's go. Do it right now. Yeah. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2805.92s)]
*  You know, so for the other candidates not doing it, it's, anyway, that's less interesting. It's [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2808.3999999999996s)]
*  fine. Maybe they'll do it. I think it's not running it through a filter, right? Because I [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2813.12s)]
*  think the traditional political thing is, and here's what's going to happen to me as a consequence. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2817.2s)]
*  I'm going to eat the consequence of this, right? Everything comes at a cost. There's no free lunch. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2821.04s)]
*  I'm going to say something in real time that reflects my honest instincts. That's my whole [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2824.96s)]
*  strategy, right? People can tell the difference, but then I'm going to change my mind on one out [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2829.3599999999997s)]
*  of a hundred things. Okay. And that's just going to happen, right? And I just have to be open to [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2834.7999999999997s)]
*  that and eat my words. And, you know, I'm going to do it at some point. And that's the trade-off [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2838.8s)]
*  we're making is that I'm not running it through the filters. I'm not making up what I believe. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2843.44s)]
*  I'm telling you actually to the contrary, what I truly believe. But if I'm doing it really that [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2848.2400000000002s)]
*  rapidly in response to what's happening, I think people appreciate that, but I'm going to eat my [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2853.04s)]
*  words at some point and that's okay. In response to new information, you might change your mind. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2857.1200000000003s)]
*  In response to new information or sometimes even in response to reflection, right? So that's just [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2860.2400000000002s)]
*  going to happen. You might make a gap basically because it's less filtered is what you're saying. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2864.5600000000004s)]
*  You might make a gap. Do you want to close the loop on this other thing? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2867.6s)]
*  Yeah. Do you think Jason caused a banking crisis by using all caps locks when he tweeted? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2870.0s)]
*  Yes or no? I did not. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2874.24s)]
*  I can't with the tweet on a Saturday night call because of bank run. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2878.0s)]
*  I did not say, I did not. I never said that either, but we did go at it pretty hard. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2882.08s)]
*  I think actually, I think there's a chance we might still disagree, Dave, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2886.3199999999997s)]
*  but I think that I'm talking to Sacks here, but. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2889.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2891.68s)]
*  So I actually talked to a lot of friends who were in the position of running companies that had some [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2891.92s)]
*  amount of gap and we talked through the specifics of the situation and then it dawned on me where [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2902.64s)]
*  and it might, it's not necessarily we're going to agree at the end of this, but there's a chance [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2908.88s)]
*  that we might actually, which is this. So in the lead up to this before that Friday, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2913.36s)]
*  I was already against any governmental intervention here. Let this play out. Why? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2921.12s)]
*  Because like, let's put aside all the histrionics, do the math on it. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2927.04s)]
*  And I remember there's a little hazy now, right? So on the facts, but I think it's [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2930.72s)]
*  approximately right. And you correct me if you have up to date facts on this, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2933.7599999999998s)]
*  but I think it's approximately right. If everybody had run and gotten their money out, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2936.7999999999997s)]
*  I think it would have been like 94 cents on the dollar that everybody would have walked out with. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2943.44s)]
*  Right. And so what happened on Friday is, and this is the part where I want to potentially build [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2947.68s)]
*  a bridge here. What happened on Friday was that Friday was the government, the FDIC or otherwise, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2952.48s)]
*  froze the ability- [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2960.88s)]
*  The California regulator on that Friday morning. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2962.32s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. The Friday morning. You were much closer to this in the details, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2964.7200000000003s)]
*  but the California regulator froze the ability to take out deposits. So I am more sympathetic [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2967.52s)]
*  to the point that once the government's gotten involved, because that really has been like, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2973.6s)]
*  you know, kind of like an oh crap moment where you're a CEO of a company or a CFO and you want to [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2978.16s)]
*  get your money out and then you can't, now it's panic. Right? Right. And so I think that there's [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2983.04s)]
*  a version of the world where the version of the world I wanted, I was talking about this before [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2988.96s)]
*  you and I were talking directly to each other. I just think this should have stayed out of it. 94 [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2992.48s)]
*  cents on the dollar, not bad, which is why the public didn't actually end up directly using [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=2995.92s)]
*  taxpayer funds was because the bank was healthy in its own right. That's the worst result a bank [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3000.4s)]
*  run would have produced there, which actually should have been heartening in terms of confidence. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3004.96s)]
*  Let me give you an insight that maybe you weren't as close to as the rest of us were, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3009.12s)]
*  which is on all the boards that all of us sit on, all of the boards we're discussing, independent [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3014.56s)]
*  of this show and the conversations in the media, we need to move all of our money out of all of the [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3019.2000000000003s)]
*  banks that aren't one of the top three and move all of our money into those top three. So the point- [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3024.0s)]
*  Which is a shame. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3028.96s)]
*  Into the Sibs, into the top four Sibs. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3029.52s)]
*  That's the point of view that we all saw was that there was a mad rush in corporate America, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3031.84s)]
*  in startup land, in small business land. This isn't even VC land. This is like everything from [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3037.12s)]
*  the nonprofits that we sit on the board of to the laundromat, to the dry cleaner, to every business [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3043.12s)]
*  that has their money in a small bank was saying, I got to move my money into a big bank now. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3048.8s)]
*  And that's where the whole banking system is put at risk. And that is why we all [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3053.52s)]
*  universally felt that it was important to highlight that the federal government needs [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3058.16s)]
*  to step in and reassure and rebuild confidence in the small banks in this country. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3063.04s)]
*  Just in the deposits. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3067.04s)]
*  And that the only way to do that was to say your deposits are safe. And that was it. And that was [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3068.48s)]
*  the point because the panic that was going on in small business land in America, which as you know, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3074.0s)]
*  employs half of the people in this country, was at risk. And that those people, those small businesses [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3078.72s)]
*  were fearful and they were looking to rush to the big banks and that would have cratered the [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3083.68s)]
*  small banks around the country. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3087.6s)]
*  So, and I think it's a difference advantage point, right? We have discussion about populism [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3088.72s)]
*  and everything else. I don't think Dave Sachs caused the bank run anymore than I'm causing [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3092.56s)]
*  populist waves in this country. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3099.3599999999997s)]
*  Again, it was Jason with his caps lock, but yeah, go ahead. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3101.12s)]
*  I know, but I think the reality is- [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3103.52s)]
*  People literally have tweeted that I caused the bank run. It's insane. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3105.7599999999998s)]
*  But there's a technical point I'll make and then we'll get to the deeper point. The technical [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3108.16s)]
*  point to close the loop is I think, Dave, I find your position more reasonable given that it's [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3113.52s)]
*  after Friday when the California regulators came in and locked it. But in my version of the world, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3121.28s)]
*  I would have just said, stay the heck out. Government of any kind, 94 cents on the dollar, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3125.7599999999998s)]
*  there's a 6% haircut. And we've discovered the market actually works and we avoid playing [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3131.04s)]
*  favoritism in the first place. And I say this as somebody who, and this is where you understand my [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3136.64s)]
*  vantage point, have been a long time opponent of the creation of the notion of SIBs, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3140.64s)]
*  Systemically Important Banks in the first place, as an opponent to the bailouts of 2008, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3146.7999999999997s)]
*  as somebody who's running for US president, not to lead incremental reforms, but a revolution [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3150.96s)]
*  in the kind of restoration and the integrity of both capitalism and democracy that I think is [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3156.08s)]
*  actually the best antidote to what you would call populism. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3159.6s)]
*  Would you try to deconstruct the SIBs? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3161.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, given the status quo of where we are, I think that I would have to offer a credible enough [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3165.12s)]
*  basis to make sure that people know that if there's a systemic, so-called, previously known [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3169.76s)]
*  as Systemically Important Bank that fails, that the public's still not going to be there for them. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3174.6400000000003s)]
*  But in a way that allows for enough of an unburdened banking sector that we have resilience [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3178.5600000000004s)]
*  in terms of exactly who can actually fill that void. And I think that there is a discursive [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3186.1600000000003s)]
*  impact on, I don't think it has to be, and this is where we may disagree a little bit, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3191.36s)]
*  and this is a small scale disagreement. I don't think it has to be a state of the world where we [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3195.44s)]
*  just assume consumers are dumb and don't take decision in account. Consumers are in part dumb [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3199.28s)]
*  because we treat them as dumb. And so it's like a Heisenberg effect. What I mean is, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3203.52s)]
*  basic principle in physics, you can't observe the spin and not affect the spin of the electron at [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3214.8s)]
*  the same time. I think the same thing applies to a relationship between the government and its people. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3219.52s)]
*  And so I think part of the reason that people, I feel the same way about the FDA, by the way. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3223.6800000000003s)]
*  I think people would be far more scrutinizing of the medicines they took if it didn't come with the [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3228.56s)]
*  crowding out effect of that individual level of self-responsibility and due diligence that the [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3236.48s)]
*  government wasn't doing. But now we live in the worst of all worlds where we have neither. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3241.92s)]
*  The government's neither actually protecting nor actually providing the space for individual [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3245.44s)]
*  responsibility. I just wanted to hear, you know, you make a statement, you collect data, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3249.12s)]
*  one in a hundred, you say you'll change your mind. I just want to understand with all the data that [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3254.08s)]
*  past, the present, and probably who knows, every incremental day we see something new. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3258.48s)]
*  What is the full 360 degree view that Vivek Ramaswami has of Donald Trump? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3264.32s)]
*  Full 360 degree view. Got it. Yeah. I actually haven't had a space to articulate this yet. So I [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3270.08s)]
*  think this is useful. So my view is that he was a successful president, measured by reviving the [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3275.6s)]
*  economy. He's successful president, period. Why do I say that? Reviving the economy, growing the [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3284.8s)]
*  American economy. I think that recognizing and speaking to and partially addressing concerns [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3291.6800000000003s)]
*  that had been historically unaddressed by both major political parties. We did not enter a major [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3298.32s)]
*  war. We were on the brink of major conflict with North Korea on the precipice in other parts of [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3303.84s)]
*  the world. ISIS was a thing. It is, you know, it exists, but it's by and large not the same threat [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3308.96s)]
*  that it was after his presidency as it was when he took over. These are major accomplishments, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3315.2s)]
*  right? I think the immigration crisis, I think, is far worse today, precisely because Biden's in [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3319.76s)]
*  office and not Trump. So I believe he was a successful president. That's view number one. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3325.12s)]
*  View number two. He has an effect on people. About 30% of this country that I think becomes [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3332.0s)]
*  psychiatrically ill when he is the U.S. president. I think it's just a fact, right? Agreeing with [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3340.08s)]
*  things that they otherwise wouldn't have agreed with because- I think that 30% number applies [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3347.28s)]
*  on our pod too. One in four. Well, I think that it's just the reality is [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3350.8s)]
*  people lose their ability to process information. People lose the ability to think independently. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3357.6s)]
*  It's like a demonic possession that happens in this country of about as best I can tell about [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3363.7599999999998s)]
*  30% of the country. And I think that's not good for the country. And we can debate who's to blame [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3368.56s)]
*  for that or whatever, but I'm just stating an observation that I feel pretty strongly about. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3373.2799999999997s)]
*  And so I think most of Trump's policies were good. Do I have some policy disagreements with [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3377.8399999999997s)]
*  them? Of course I do. It would be weird if any two people agreed on 100% of things. I would re-enter [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3381.2799999999997s)]
*  the CPTPP. He exited the TPP. I think his exit of the TPP gives us a stronger negotiating position [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3385.76s)]
*  with Malaysia and Japan to fix some of the micro things that we might have wanted. China's not in [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3392.2400000000002s)]
*  the TPP. That's part of the path to actually declare economic independence from China. If it [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3396.6400000000003s)]
*  comes to that, we could go into a lot of different details. I would have rescinded the affirmative [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3400.48s)]
*  action executive order that Lyndon signed that I asked Trump's people why they didn't. They said [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3404.88s)]
*  it was a political hill they didn't want to die on. I'd shut down the Department of Education. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3408.5600000000004s)]
*  We can go on, but broadly, he was a successful president with whom I mostly agree on his broad [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3412.4s)]
*  policy vision and especially his handling of foreign policy. What did he get wrong? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3417.84s)]
*  And was the election stolen? Yeah. So I gave you small examples of what he got wrong, but I think [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3422.4s)]
*  the real thing that he got wrong, I'm not sure that getting wrong is even framing. It's just a [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3429.28s)]
*  fact that 30% of this country became psychiatrically ill. And you're the leader of this country, [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3435.6800000000003s)]
*  you're leading a nation. And so you can decide whose fault that is, but I believe leaders are [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3440.8s)]
*  ultimately judged by their results. And for whatever reason, even when I'm saying the same [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3444.7200000000003s)]
*  things that Trump often did as a matter of policy or foreign policy or domestic economic policy, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3449.84s)]
*  maybe it's because people don't yet know me broadly, but I don't think that's it, actually. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3457.44s)]
*  I don't think I'm having that effect on people. And I think that that's why I'm in this race, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3462.1600000000003s)]
*  to carry forward unapologetic George Washington, America first policies and to do so more [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3467.68s)]
*  successfully, but also in a way that unites the country around that vision more so than Donald [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3473.44s)]
*  Trump ever did or could in a second term. Was the election stole? Here's the sense in which I think [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3479.44s)]
*  the election was stolen in a data-driven way. I have not seen any data to suggest that the ballot [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3485.68s)]
*  fraud or anything like that would have been sufficient to overturn the ballot count of the [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3491.68s)]
*  ballots. I've not seen any evidence to that effect. What I do see is hard evidence that [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3496.96s)]
*  people in this country would have elected a different president. Who's that? [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3506.4s)]
*  I like, who's that? This is Tali. This is child number five. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3511.68s)]
*  Number five. She is cute. But number one in our heart. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3516.4s)]
*  That's nice. All right. So what's your name? That's your name? I would say Tali. Tali. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3521.52s)]
*  Hey, I'm away from my sons these last few days. So I'm happy for you. Hopefully we'll be with our [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3526.08s)]
*  little guys soon. What I was saying is, let me get to the punchline. The sense in which the election [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3533.76s)]
*  was stolen was the Hunter Biden laptop story and the systematic suppression of information. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3538.0s)]
*  I think that there is no doubt. I think that the evidence strongly suggests that Trump would have [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3544.08s)]
*  been elected and not Biden had we actually a voter base that had access to that information. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3550.48s)]
*  And I think that that is something that we ought to learn from. And I think that it does cast [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3558.08s)]
*  a lot of doubt and frustration on the legitimacy of the election. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3562.48s)]
*  Let me double click on that. You seem to have said on other programs, I've heard you at least [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3566.56s)]
*  a half dozen times talk about deep space, deep state conspiracy, trying to frame Donald Trump, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3570.96s)]
*  federal indictment of the 37 criminal charges for the stolen documents, refusing to give them back. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3579.6800000000003s)]
*  You got the New York case, 34 more felony counts. We're about to have another one drop on January [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3585.92s)]
*  6th. You got the Georgia where he tried to get people to get 10,000 more votes. You got the New [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3590.88s)]
*  York case where CFO is going to jail. You got him guilty of sexual assault. And then you got [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3596.4s)]
*  Letita James is suing the Trump organization of these seven are all seven a deep state conspiracy. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3603.6s)]
*  I think it's a collective anaphylactic immune response to an antigen that challenged the system. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3610.7999999999997s)]
*  I guess really what it is. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3618.64s)]
*  So in no case did he do anything wrong. You think all seven of these cases he's scot-free. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3619.6s)]
*  I want to be really clear about something. I'm running for U.S. president in this race against [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3624.3199999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump because I'm the best position to lead this nation forward. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3628.96s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3631.92s)]
*  But I was guilty of any of these seven. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3632.1600000000003s)]
*  I would have made I would have made very different judgments than he did. But I think criminalizing [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3634.0s)]
*  bad judgments, especially when done so against political opponents in the midst of a presidential [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3637.92s)]
*  election is an awful judgment for a U.S. president and the Department of Justice underneath him to [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3642.5600000000004s)]
*  make. So you think the Department of Justice and the person who put in charge of it, they're all [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3648.5600000000004s)]
*  conspiring and that he didn't do anything wrong. Well, there's like a lot in that statement, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3654.96s)]
*  right? Sure. Does he did he do things that I think are reprehensible that I wouldn't have done? [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3660.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. I mean, as long as as they exist. Absolutely. Do I think that Biden and a lot of [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3666.1600000000003s)]
*  other politicians who have come have done things that I would have done differently and actually [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3672.7200000000003s)]
*  think were wrong decisions? Absolutely. But do I think that conflating a bad judgment with a [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3677.04s)]
*  breakage of law is a risk to our future? I think it is. Do you think he sent those people to? [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3683.92s)]
*  I mean, you want to just go to January 6th? I don't think he did. No, no. I think we need to [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3689.6s)]
*  march down there. And when he told the proud boys to stand by and stand back, you don't think that [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3694.88s)]
*  he was inciting them? Let me just say I'm not here to defend Donald Trump's behavior. I'm running for [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3699.92s)]
*  U.S. president. I think we need to speak the truth. But I think your opinion on it matters. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3706.72s)]
*  My opinion on this matters. Yes. I want to be very clear about the hat that I'm wearing. I would not [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3710.08s)]
*  have done what he did. But he was very clear. I mean, you look at the transcripts and you run [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3713.68s)]
*  this by as I have First Amendment scholars just to check my inciting violence is not protected [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3719.12s)]
*  speech by the First Amendment. There's no sense in which when he tells people to peacefully make [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3723.9199999999996s)]
*  their way to the Capitol, that does not meet any Supreme Court test for what constitutes inciting [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3729.12s)]
*  violence in this country. I think that let's just take this. Take the New York example. I mean, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3734.16s)]
*  some of the stuff, the details actually matter. Let's take the Oath Keepers one because that [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3738.08s)]
*  found well, I have one Rhodes. Hold on. Should hold on. Let me get this one first. Hold on. Let [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3741.6s)]
*  me get my first. Oath Keepers founder, Stuart Rhodes got 18 years. Do you think that the Justice [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3746.16s)]
*  Department did that because they're trying to frame Trump and Trump told the Oath Keepers [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3749.8399999999997s)]
*  to stand by and to stand back? Do you think he incited the Oath Keepers? Yes or no? [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3755.2799999999997s)]
*  Based on the facts that I have seen, I've seen no evidence of that. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3760.3199999999997s)]
*  You're delusional. Okay. Yeah. I mean, look, hold them to stand by. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3763.36s)]
*  Okay. So I'm also, there's also an indictment that hasn't been brought. So I've offered my opinion [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3768.16s)]
*  on the first two indictments that have been brought against him, right? I read them. I read [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3774.96s)]
*  all 49 pages in the last one. I'm responsive to facts. Yeah. On the first two indictments, [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3778.48s)]
*  I think they're absolutely politically based indict. And I can go through the, if you're [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3784.24s)]
*  interested, we can go into the specifics of it. I mean, it might be boring. I'll take out your word. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3789.52s)]
*  Yeah. You know, on New York, right? I mean, I'll just give you a line on each, right? Okay. In New [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3792.8799999999997s)]
*  York, let's take a fact that it's a state offense that was upcharged to a felony and outside the [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3797.52s)]
*  statute of limitations only by tying it to an alleged federal crime. And what was that federal [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3804.56s)]
*  crime? Failing to report a hush money payment to a porn star as a campaign contribution. There would [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3810.0s)]
*  be a stronger case for using and paying hush money and using campaign funds to do it, that that was [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3816.56s)]
*  a federal campaign finance law violation than not actually counting it. So, so many counts, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3822.4s)]
*  that's a politicized prosecution against anybody else. They wouldn't have brought it documents case, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3827.44s)]
*  a 49 page indictment, read it twice. That does not once mention the presidential records act, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3832.8s)]
*  the most relevant statute that talks about what the basis is for president to keep documents or [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3839.44s)]
*  not. And instead charges him according to, I think one of the most un-American laws in us history [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3843.52s)]
*  passed during world war one to silence world war one dissenters, including Eugene V. Debs, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3849.04s)]
*  who Eugene V. Debs, who was actually put in prison over this. I have long argued that that was a [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3854.72s)]
*  statute that should have long been over, should have been rescinded. That's now being used to [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3860.08s)]
*  charge a crime rather than eat more precise crime. So I tend to be very responsive, maybe to the [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3864.32s)]
*  point of frustration of being technical on these things, but I believe facts and law actually [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3868.96s)]
*  matter. I think that if Trump was the best guy for the job, I wouldn't be running in this race. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3873.52s)]
*  If Ronald Reagan were alive and well today, I would not be running in this race. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3878.24s)]
*  Got it. So you're not a fan. I want to just go back to the- [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3882.56s)]
*  Oh, wait, wait. I have a question. I have a question about these Trump scandals. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3886.16s)]
*  Do you think that- Which one of the seven? [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3890.64s)]
*  Well, I think, do you think Trump should be indicted for Donald Trump Jr. being paid $83,000 a [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3892.8799999999997s)]
*  month to serve on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, despite having no energy expertise? [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3898.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh wait, that's Hunter. And his personal life being in crisis because he's a drug addict, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3903.8399999999997s)]
*  him getting that job three months after his father approved and backed a coup against the [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3908.72s)]
*  Ukrainian government. Do you think that Donald Trump Jr. should be investigated for that? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3914.9599999999996s)]
*  And David, is this also after that Donald Trump then sends $200 billion of U.S. taxpayer money [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3920.3999999999996s)]
*  to that very country after he's elected in office? I think that's the strongest of the scandals I've [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3927.68s)]
*  heard so far. So you believe Biden is a grifter? Oh wait, did I say Donald Trump Jr.? I meant Hunter [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3932.7999999999997s)]
*  Biden. Sorry. Well, since we're on grifters, what do you think of Jared Kushner taking down [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3936.96s)]
*  $2 billion from the Saudis after he walked out of the White House? I don't have, that's not a [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3941.52s)]
*  matter that I have views on. Oh, you don't have views on that, but you got plenty of views on Trump. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3949.28s)]
*  Well, because he's not in government. He's not in government. Okay, let's move on past Trump. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3953.76s)]
*  Because- This is a great example of why I'm in this race. I'm telling you this, is there something [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3957.44s)]
*  about the existence of Donald Trump- Exactly, can't get away from- [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3963.12s)]
*  Criminal behavior. That deflects our ability- [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3965.92s)]
*  Yeah, criminal behavior. To carry forward the agenda of this country, much of which was Trump's [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3969.04s)]
*  own agenda. So Vivek, in order to win this candidacy, and the reason I brought up the Politico [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3974.56s)]
*  publication this morning, obviously there was a bit of tongue in cheek on the effusiveness, but [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3980.24s)]
*  the key point being made was you have no chance of winning and that you shouldn't be in the race at [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3985.2799999999997s)]
*  all. Now, look, I'd like to- I think that was the thesis of the piece. That's a fair description. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3990.4s)]
*  What's interesting is where it's coming from, right? It's coming from the establishment voice. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=3996.56s)]
*  And I think we'd like to hear just a little bit around your political strategy. What is your [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4001.6800000000003s)]
*  intention around building bridges and ties to the Republican establishment to support your candidacy [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4006.88s)]
*  here? Or does the Republican establishment largely sit on the sidelines right now and wait to see [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4013.6s)]
*  who emerges with this popular movement and who's out there? You're obviously running an incredible [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4019.68s)]
*  campaign on the road, very active, very vocal, and as everyone says, probably by far the most [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4025.2s)]
*  articulate and most thoughtful and most intelligent of the candidates in the race today. But lacking [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4031.2799999999997s)]
*  experience, lacking connections, not part of the establishment, and as a result, cast in this [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4036.72s)]
*  negative light consistently by these sorts of writers. So what is your strategy to win this race [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4042.48s)]
*  given the- is it not important, as Trump showed in the last election cycle, to have those Republican [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4049.12s)]
*  establishment ties? Or are you going to be building bridges? And then my follow-up question is if you [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4054.72s)]
*  don't win, what are you going to do? So- Yeah. So let me address the first. It's basically in the [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4059.3599999999997s)]
*  camp that I don't think- it's the voters that ultimately matter, not the people who have [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4065.92s)]
*  appointed themselves in the reigning establishment. It's not even the establishment anymore. It's an [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4070.88s)]
*  outdated establishment that I don't think actually is going to influence meaningfully the result of [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4075.12s)]
*  this election except for one respect, which is money, which I'll get back to. So the area where [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4081.04s)]
*  we're punching above our weight, debates haven't even happened yet, at least in the last week. I'm [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4085.44s)]
*  third in most of the national polls. This is well ahead of even where we planned to be. We planned [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4091.2s)]
*  to be in third by November, December ahead of the Iowa caucuses, ahead of New Hampshire, overperform [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4097.36s)]
*  expectations, and both of those use the momentum to then win the race. That was broadly the strategy [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4102.56s)]
*  with the debate stage as the way where I would steadily work my way into that. I think we're [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4106.56s)]
*  just now on a different curve where we might be in second place by then and by a smaller margin than [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4110.72s)]
*  people expected. I think the debate stage is critical. The campaign strategy is actually to [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4116.0s)]
*  combine the initial investment that, because I've lived the American dream, I was able to make, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4121.120000000001s)]
*  but to combine that with a true grassroots uplift. We've got close to 70,000, maybe more. I have to [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4126.320000000001s)]
*  check the exact numbers. Unique donors already. You have former vice presidents or other candidates [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4132.16s)]
*  that are well on their way and struggling by some measures to get to 40,000, which is the threshold [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4137.28s)]
*  for the first debate. So our strategy is very much a grassroots strategy. I've done more campaign [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4142.8s)]
*  events than anybody in the Republican field. And so this is, our strategy is very grassroots driven. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4147.92s)]
*  I'm punching above my weight in terms of events, unique donations, polling. The one area where I'm [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4154.32s)]
*  punching below weight is large scale donations. So we are not raising mass numbers of large check [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4161.2s)]
*  external funds yet into the campaign. My super PACs or I don't even, I mean, whatever, they're [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4169.599999999999s)]
*  independent expenditures. There's an entity that exists out there that's been affiliated with me [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4174.8s)]
*  has, based on public reports, tiny amounts of money compared to those that are supporting an [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4179.599999999999s)]
*  all in for candidates from Tim Scott to Ron DeSantis. And that's also a reality, right? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4186.64s)]
*  And I think that comes with competitive advantages and disadvantages. And they're two sides of the [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4192.56s)]
*  same coin. I think I am at liberty, total liberty. I feel totally unconstrained to pursue the strategy [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4196.4800000000005s)]
*  that David mentioned earlier, which is that I'm reacting in real time to what I believe. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4203.04s)]
*  Have you been surprised by the lack of clarity, maybe of the DeSantis campaign [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4207.76s)]
*  in really creating a pathway through Trump? And if you are surprised, what do you think [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4215.04s)]
*  he's doing wrong? If you had to critique it? Yeah, I'm not surprised because I know him [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4223.84s)]
*  and I think he's a good executor, right? I think he has been, I disagree with some other people on [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4229.5199999999995s)]
*  this. I think he's been quite an effective governor. I think that when you're talking about, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4234.96s)]
*  and Scott Walker in the last cycle was quite an effective governor. And for the same reason [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4240.24s)]
*  that people believed Scott Walker was going to be the runaway nominee last time around, [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4244.88s)]
*  I think that people naturally gravitate. People think they want somebody who has done something [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4248.88s)]
*  as an effective executor. But when it comes to the US presidency, I think it's a unique role where [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4254.08s)]
*  what matters is actually having a vision for where we are going, right? And so I'm not, [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4259.12s)]
*  without saying things that are interpreted as being mean about somebody else or not, [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4266.400000000001s)]
*  I know all of these people have known them for a long time. I've shared stages with them [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4269.76s)]
*  over the course of my Woke Inc book tour and Nation of Victims book tour. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4273.84s)]
*  I'm not surprised with how things are going in this race. I said we expected to be where we are [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4279.2s)]
*  in November. We're here in July. I'm not surprised that we're doing well. I understand how audiences [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4283.84s)]
*  across this country responded to my message in Woke Inc. I'm not surprised that they're continuing [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4289.04s)]
*  to respond well to Trump. I think there's nothing surprising about where we are in this race right [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4292.96s)]
*  now. And so you're not surprised because DeSantis is a competent administrator, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4296.88s)]
*  but that is a great job as governor, but not the bill of goods for the president. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4303.6s)]
*  I'm really at a point in this race from, I want to focus not on criticizing other candidates, [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4311.2s)]
*  but to be honest with you, I think there's a lot of truth to what you said. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4315.28s)]
*  Yeah. Don't you think part of it though is that Trump has singled out DeSantis as the one candidate [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4317.76s)]
*  who he's going to beat the hell out of? I mean, I don't think so, David, actually. I'll tell you why. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4322.8s)]
*  It's, it's, it's true, right? He has not attacked you. Trump's actually said good things about you. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4328.24s)]
*  He's not attacked anybody else in this race. Have you spent time with Trump? [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4333.12s)]
*  I know all these guys. I know. Have you spent time with Trump? When's the last time you talked to him? [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4337.52s)]
*  Not a serious amount of time. I've spent more time with DeSantis than I have with Trump. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4341.28s)]
*  Have you spent over an hour with Trump? Once. Yeah. When this long before I was running for [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4344.24s)]
*  president, but we had dinner. Has his people ever reached out and tried to build bridges with you? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4348.72s)]
*  We've talked back state. I mean, most of us, when we intersect each other, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4355.2s)]
*  we're speaking at the same forums, the NRA, the family leader thing that Tucker did backstage. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4358.0s)]
*  We have interactions with all the other candidates. I'd like to think I'm friendly with everybody. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4362.16s)]
*  You know, I don't know how, you know, I haven't talked to Ron recently, but I've talked to him [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4366.639999999999s)]
*  more before, but I think the reality is, you know, so Dave, what you said is definitely true. And I'm [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4370.16s)]
*  not in this to be a political analyst, right? I'm in this to stay where my beliefs are, say who I am [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4376.4s)]
*  and people can vote for me or not. But I actually do think, I don't think that Trump's commentary [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4381.28s)]
*  on the other candidates is having so much of an effect. I think voters, many people who were [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4386.639999999999s)]
*  maybe initially behind the Sanis, I know many of them were people who are part of that traditional [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4390.96s)]
*  establishment. They didn't want that. Most of them didn't want to have nothing to do with Trump, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4395.44s)]
*  but decided that that was the next best thing. So I don't think that Trump's attacks are going to [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4399.04s)]
*  persuade them one way or another. I think it comes down to the study of what happened in 2016, [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4402.72s)]
*  right? Scott Walker, great governor, really respect the guy. And I like what he's doing in his post [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4408.0s)]
*  elected office life as well. But everybody has a role to play in reviving this country. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4412.96s)]
*  And I think we all have to look ourselves in the mirror and ask ourselves, how are we going to [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4418.4800000000005s)]
*  make our unique contribution? And I think it's going to require governors who are effective [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4422.72s)]
*  implementers of a vision that makes their states thrive. I think governor says they're really good [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4427.92s)]
*  job of that. I think Kristi Noem has done a really good job of that. I think there are people who [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4434.0s)]
*  hopefully will continue to have an impact on our culture outside of government altogether. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4438.64s)]
*  There's a really important role for that. Jason, I think that's my answer to your other question. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4443.84s)]
*  Which I forgot to answer, which is to two things that you mentioned just in passing, but I just [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4448.16s)]
*  want you to clarify your thoughts on them. One, as you said, you would abolish the Department of [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4453.2s)]
*  Education. And I thought I've never heard anybody say that really. So could you just expand on that [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4459.2s)]
*  what you mean? And then the second, I'd love for you to talk about some of these Supreme Court [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4465.2s)]
*  decisions that have come in the last little while specifically, the abortion debate, the affirmative [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4470.72s)]
*  action debate, the rights of businesses to not service people whose ideology they disagree with. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4476.88s)]
*  And then, sorry, the third point is maybe use that last part as a jumping off point. I'd love for you [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4484.88s)]
*  to understand your position on LGBTQ, the role of the trans movement, what's happening in schools. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4489.84s)]
*  Those are the three kind of big chunky areas that I think are worth talking about if you can just [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4498.16s)]
*  give a few minutes. Yeah, there's a lot there. So let me, if I skip over something, bring me back. So [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4502.8s)]
*  Department of Education. I think the federal government is not, as a factual matter, [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4510.72s)]
*  directly involved in education. I think it is therefore a deadweight waste for money to [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4514.72s)]
*  cycle from the taxpayers to the federal Department of Education to then disperse those funds [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4518.96s)]
*  inefficiently as they do, tilting the scales to four-year college degrees over choices that [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4523.360000000001s)]
*  people might have otherwise made that are better choices for them. Vocational training, one-year, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4528.64s)]
*  two-year programs. Using it as a cudgel, and this relates to the latter issue you asked about, [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4532.96s)]
*  to tell local schools they don't get that money unless they're adopting what I certainly view as [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4538.320000000001s)]
*  toxic racial and gender ideology-based agendas. They use the money as a cudgel to do it. So I've [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4543.04s)]
*  said that that department that spends about $80 billion of taxpayer money, I'll shut it down. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4548.88s)]
*  Tonight in New Hampshire, I'm laying out the anatomy of exactly how we'll shut it down. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4553.76s)]
*  And then return that money to the states, to the people, put it in parents' pockets. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4558.64s)]
*  Very specifically, you have to be a state that has a school choice program in order to receive that [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4563.04s)]
*  Department of Education shutdown dividend. I think that if you're such a state, I would also [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4568.0s)]
*  believe that those states need to write their teachers' union, teachers' contracts, [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4572.56s)]
*  in a way that stops teachers from joining teachers' unions, which I think have been a [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4577.12s)]
*  destructive force on our public schools. If you're unionizing against the public, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4581.280000000001s)]
*  think about who you're unionizing against, the very kids you're supposed to represent. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4585.84s)]
*  Now we have transparency, we have choice. If you teach it in the classroom, put it online. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4589.52s)]
*  And then there's an interesting fact in this country where I think you guys will appreciate [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4594.24s)]
*  how bizarre this fact really is. There's not only like a failed positive correlation, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4598.400000000001s)]
*  there is a negative correlation, an inverse correlation between how much money per student [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4606.08s)]
*  a public school spends and the actual outcomes that that school achieves for its students. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4612.64s)]
*  So in my version of school choice, my preferred version, it would not just be that parents get to [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4620.400000000001s)]
*  get these vouchers and educational savings accounts to send their kids to some other school. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4625.52s)]
*  That's part of the story. It's a first step. But I think any parent who moves to a school [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4629.200000000001s)]
*  that spends less per student, which we know based on the data, is actually all as equal [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4635.360000000001s)]
*  a better performing school as it relates to achievement, should be able to take half the [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4640.24s)]
*  delta with them. So to take Chicago or Pennsylvania spending $35,000, $40,000 per student, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4644.32s)]
*  15 miles away you have a school spending $15,000 to $20,000 per student. I think they should be [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4649.92s)]
*  able to take half the difference, that $10,000 to $15,000, half that difference of the $20,000, [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4654.32s)]
*  say $10,000 they take with them. You run the math on normal investment returns. You're talking [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4658.88s)]
*  about a quarter million dollar plus graduation gift when that kid graduates from 12th grade. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4664.32s)]
*  So you tell me which is a better use of money. It's not even close. And I think the head of the [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4669.6s)]
*  state is a better idea. That's a great idea. That's a great, great idea. Did you come up with that [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4674.24s)]
*  idea or is that something that's out there? It was actually another guy who's an arbitrager, [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4678.32s)]
*  who's a friend, but who shares similar instincts. And I'm like, I'm a value investor, I believe, [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4682.88s)]
*  in market dislocation. It's a great incentive. It just makes all the sense in the world. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4687.92s)]
*  Yeah. Okay, let's move past education. Yeah, I want to talk about the specific, the gay and [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4691.68s)]
*  the trans issue. Two questions. One, do you think it's normal to be gay? And you have any [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4697.04s)]
*  problem with people being gay? And then- No, I do not have a problem. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4702.48s)]
*  ... religious spaces, et cetera? No problem. So then the second- [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4706.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course. Talking about trans, I heard you on Meet the Press [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4707.92s)]
*  say that trans was a mental disorder, which- Yeah. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4711.12s)]
*  ... it was in the DSM-IV, I guess, or whatever the latest one was. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4715.04s)]
*  In five, I think, yeah. Yeah, just a couple years ago, [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4718.16s)]
*  and now it's changed. So maybe explain why you think differently about those two things. One, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4720.32s)]
*  you think it's fine to be gay, but you think it's a mental disorder in all likelihood if [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4726.08s)]
*  people want to transition. Yeah. So I want to leave you with a good sense of where I'm at on [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4730.64s)]
*  these issues, right? So I think it's at least curious that when you take the LGBTQIA plus [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4737.28s)]
*  value set and vision for what the movement stands for, it does require you to adopt [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4745.84s)]
*  simultaneously conflicting beliefs at once, right? The gay rights movement was predicated [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4753.12s)]
*  on the idea, which I'm quite sympathetic to, that the sex of the person that you're attracted to is [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4758.88s)]
*  hardwired on the day you're born. But now with the T component of that same movement that now says [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4763.36s)]
*  your own gender is completely fluid over the course of your own life. And I think if we're [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4768.16s)]
*  not going to observe the tension between these two observations, I think that we're purposefully [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4772.639999999999s)]
*  having our heads stuck in the sand. I think what's happening in many cases is somebody who claims to [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4777.92s)]
*  be trans is really just gay. And part of what we're saying is it's not okay to be gay. So to [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4781.44s)]
*  answer your first question, part of what the trans movement is effectively telling people is that [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4786.08s)]
*  it's not okay to be gay. You know who else says that? Iran. Actually, Iran is a nation that if [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4790.16s)]
*  you are gay, they force you to undergo gender conversion surgery. It's not that different [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4795.04s)]
*  than what's baked into the ideological premise of much of the trans movement here. And so [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4799.5199999999995s)]
*  I just want you to come from the fact there's a lot of people in the GOP who will offer surface [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4804.0s)]
*  level stuff here. I've spent a lot of time thinking about this. Gender dysphoria is what [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4807.76s)]
*  I've said is a mental health disorder. I've been very precise. Let's take the intersex case out of [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4814.16s)]
*  it. Klinefelter syndrome, Jacob's syndrome, right? Klinefelter is X, X, Y. Jacob syndrome is X, Y, [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4819.280000000001s)]
*  Y. These are ultra rare. They exist. They are real. For the purpose of our discussion, though [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4826.4800000000005s)]
*  it's under the broad trans umbrella, I'm going to take that out of it because that's not a mental [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4832.8s)]
*  health disorder. That's a genetic reality. But now let's go back to the conflicting supposition. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4836.32s)]
*  There's no gay gene, yet the sex of the person you're attracted to, we accept for civil rights [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4843.679999999999s)]
*  purposes, is hard-rired on the day you're born. Yet there are X and Y chromosomes, and yet your [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4847.36s)]
*  own biological sex slash gender is now completely fluid over the course of your life. There's a [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4852.48s)]
*  tension there. And I think that tension is best explained by the way we've treated it for most of [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4856.96s)]
*  our national history, for most of our medical history, all the way through actually I think the [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4862.16s)]
*  DSM-5, not just the four, as a mental health condition. And I think the compassionate thing [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4866.32s)]
*  to do is not to affirm, especially when it's a kid, to affirm a kid's confusion. I think the [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4871.76s)]
*  compassionate thing to do is to recognize that there's some other psychological struggle [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4878.48s)]
*  manifesting itself in this form. And it is cruel to affirm that kid's confusion. Am I too young? [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4883.04s)]
*  And by affirm, you mean surgery or hormone therapy? [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4888.8s)]
*  Hormone therapy, exactly. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4892.0s)]
*  So you would limit that to when you're an adult, 18 years old? [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4893.12s)]
*  Yes. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4896.88s)]
*  And you would ban parents- [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4897.12s)]
*  There's two women I met here in New Hampshire, literally like where I am right now, [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4898.16s)]
*  who are in their 20s that badly regret undergoing double mastectomies. One of them underwent a [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4901.360000000001s)]
*  hysterectomy. Both of them underwent puberty blockers. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4906.08s)]
*  So even if the parents and doctors agreed with it, you would say they can't make that decision [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4909.2s)]
*  for the child? Just like you can't get a tattoo before the age of 18 in most, [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4912.96s)]
*  what we say is a decision that you are likely to regret, many, in many cases at least, likely to [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4918.4800000000005s)]
*  regret later in life. We let you make that decision as an adult. And I do believe we live in a free [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4926.080000000001s)]
*  society. As an adult, you're free to identify how you want, a free to wear what you want. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4930.160000000001s)]
*  But kids aren't the same as adults. And even among adults, there's a difference between [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4937.200000000001s)]
*  living your life freely and expecting that everybody else changes their linguistic and [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4941.6s)]
*  traditional understandings in sports and traditional understandings in locker rooms [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4949.76s)]
*  and traditional understandings in language. That's a difference. And so I don't believe [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4955.76s)]
*  in a tyranny of the majority, but I don't believe in a tyranny of the minority either. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4960.320000000001s)]
*  Do you think this topic is over-indexed on right now and is a really important topic [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4963.04s)]
*  with the presidency? Or do you think this is like some sort of culture wars thing that this [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4966.72s)]
*  actually isn't that important to the national discussion should be held privately by parents? [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4970.96s)]
*  I appreciate you asking that, Jason, is I think I feel this way about a lot of the topics, right? [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4975.76s)]
*  From racial, racial, racial position on that. I think like, why is this the most important topic? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4980.56s)]
*  Yeah, this is, this is interesting because it's a symptom is interesting only to the extent that [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4985.6s)]
*  it is a symptom of the deeper void of the deeper vacuum. And I think the mental health epidemic [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4991.68s)]
*  is not limited to gender dysphoria, anxiety, depression, drug usage, fentanyl, suicide. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=4998.16s)]
*  Let's have the conversation more holistically. These are symptoms of the deeper void. And all [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5004.48s)]
*  I care about is running through these topics without somebody holding the line of defense [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5010.24s)]
*  by stopping us to get to a discussion about that void to say, no, this is exactly what that kid is [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5014.24s)]
*  and you're wrong to think about as a mental health disorder. I think that's unproductive [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5018.96s)]
*  because it stops us from getting to the truth. Over the years, it's been the case that [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5022.639999999999s)]
*  young people tend to orient to being countercultural or anti-establishment. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5028.16s)]
*  Generally speaking, it's part of the psychological seasoning of a human to be against the parents, [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5034.88s)]
*  against the system, and ultimately to create independence for oneself. And that's typically [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5041.5199999999995s)]
*  counter to what came before it. And it has manifested in every generation with this point [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5046.0s)]
*  of view that there is some psychological torment that has taken over the young people that is [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5051.5199999999995s)]
*  causing them to act out from beatniks to hippies to punks to goth to emo. And every generation had [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5056.32s)]
*  some cultural representation. Is your point of view that gender dysphoria is the current [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5064.48s)]
*  manifestation of that pattern of behavior that we've seen over the generations? [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5069.36s)]
*  That's not exactly my view. My view is that it's not limited to young people. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5075.2s)]
*  I think there's something unique going on in America right now. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5079.5199999999995s)]
*  It's true of all of us. In some sense, some of this comes from self-reflection, but I think it's [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5082.32s)]
*  true for most of us that we're hungry to be part of something bigger than ourselves, [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5091.679999999999s)]
*  yet we cannot even answer what it means to be an American or what it means to believe in God or [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5098.88s)]
*  what God is. And we have come up with new false idols that substitute for that. So I'm talking [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5105.36s)]
*  about generational history. I mean, Moses, by the time he comes down from the mountaintop, [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5111.04s)]
*  you got the golden calf. Israelites are lost in the desert. They say they want to go back and be [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5115.04s)]
*  ruled by the Pharaoh. Yeah. I think the historical trend I'm talking about is a slightly different [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5119.44s)]
*  one and maybe has a longer arc to it than the one you're talking about. But my diagnosis is not [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5123.28s)]
*  specific to young people. It's specific to where we are in a national history. When like a bunch of [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5130.24s)]
*  blind bats in a cave, right? How does a bat figure out where it is? It sends out echo location [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5136.0s)]
*  signals, sonar signals that come back and say, this is where I am. I think we human beings are [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5141.04s)]
*  wired to do the same thing. And the pillars, the walls, the fixed points of truth from family to [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5146.8s)]
*  faith to patriotism to hard work to individual pride, the things that used to ground us, when [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5152.8s)]
*  those things disappear, we're now sending out these signals and then nothing's coming back. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5158.24s)]
*  And so we're making up new pillars instead. And maybe one of them is a trans flag and maybe one [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5162.88s)]
*  of them is a Ukraine flag and maybe one of them is a climate cult and maybe one of them is a racial [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5168.24s)]
*  intersectional hierarchy and maybe one of them is fentanyl. But I think that that's, [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5174.24s)]
*  I do have a deep point of agreement with you and Jason that I think we sometimes get too hung up, [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5181.36s)]
*  both sides, maybe even Republicans a lot so right now on the symptoms without getting to a deeper [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5186.16s)]
*  discussion of the deeper cancer, the deeper void that we need to fill. And that's what I'm [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5192.16s)]
*  interested in. Chumot brought up the Roe v Wade issue. I was wondering, what do you think is the [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5197.04s)]
*  most productive path forward for the country in terms of reasonable right to choose versus right [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5203.92s)]
*  to life argument? Because you personally feel that abortion should be banned. Am I correct? [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5210.5599999999995s)]
*  I am personally pro-life. You're pro-life. So you don't believe you should be able to get an abortion [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5216.24s)]
*  under any circumstances or do you have rape? My view as someone who's running for US president [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5220.4s)]
*  responding to the question about the Supreme Court case is that Roe versus Wade was correct [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5225.36s)]
*  to be overturned on constitutional grounds. Okay, fine. It was made up. It's a legal argument. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5229.839999999999s)]
*  How do you personally feel? But it leads also to the path for moving forward, which is that I think [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5234.32s)]
*  the federal government should stay out of it. And so there's a discussion amongst Republicans. I think [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5238.719999999999s)]
*  I'm the only Republican candidate in this field who has come out and said that I would not support [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5243.36s)]
*  a federal abortion ban of any kind on principled ground. Because to me, I am grounded in [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5249.76s)]
*  constitutional principles and I think there's no legal basis for the federal government to legislate [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5256.96s)]
*  here. The 10th Amendment says that part of the American experiment is we have diversity [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5261.280000000001s)]
*  across states. And I think this is a state's issue. Now, at the level of the states, [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5266.08s)]
*  I'm personally a believer that unborn life is life. I think that the pro-life movement needs to, [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5272.4800000000005s)]
*  we need to walk the walk. When it comes to being pro-life, what do I mean? I'm pro-contraception. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5278.32s)]
*  I'm pro-adoption. I'm pro-childcare. I'm pro-more sexual responsibility for men. For God's sake, [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5283.759999999999s)]
*  we live in an era of genetic tests. We can actually put more responsibility on men. This doesn't have [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5289.92s)]
*  to be and should not be a men's versus women's rights issue. And nobody on our side is really [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5294.88s)]
*  talking about these issues. I do because I don't think this has to be as divisive as we made it [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5298.88s)]
*  out to be. But I can almost prove to you that more people in this country share my instincts [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5303.2s)]
*  than are willing to admit it. There's a case, Clarence Thomas brought it up of pregnant woman [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5308.16s)]
*  walking down the street. She's assaulted. The unborn child dies as a result. I haven't met, [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5313.84s)]
*  and I have many liberal friends. Most of my friends growing up have been, you know, [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5322.4s)]
*  have different political persuasions than I have now. I haven't met a single one of my liberal [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5325.84s)]
*  friends or otherwise who says that that criminal does not deserve liability for that death. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5330.32s)]
*  And so I just think more of us share these common instincts. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5337.84s)]
*  If one state wants to ban it, they can ban it. If another state wants to have a 24-week [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5340.48s)]
*  rule, they could have a 24-week rule. That's you're on the best solution. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5345.92s)]
*  Unlike other Republican candidates, I will not be signing a federal abortion ban on constitutional [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5348.08s)]
*  grounds. And I remain open to persuasion. If some legal scholar convinces me that the U.S. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5352.48s)]
*  Constitution gives the federal government the authority to sign that in the law, so be it. But [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5356.72s)]
*  I have not been so convinced. And I think many other principled constitutionalists haven't been [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5361.4400000000005s)]
*  convinced even though the other Republican field has all, that's another candidate in this race, [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5365.68s)]
*  has said they would sign one. What is your thought on just the gross tonnage [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5370.400000000001s)]
*  of dollars that we spend on the military and defense and espionage and, you know, internal, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5373.6s)]
*  external security and then when those bump up against civil liberties, just give us your [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5381.36s)]
*  kind of framing on how you think about those sets of issues around national level security, [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5387.599999999999s)]
*  but where and personal privacy. So I'm, I, for more of my life than not, [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5392.48s)]
*  identified as a libertarian than a conservative. And I still have all of those libertarian [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5398.4s)]
*  instincts in my core. It's just that I care about more issues than libertarians care about, [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5402.719999999999s)]
*  because libertarianism is all about the relationship between the state and the [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5407.6s)]
*  individual. And I actually do care about culture and the fabric of the society outside of government [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5410.72s)]
*  too. It's a long way of saying I'm deeply skeptical of the national security establishment. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5415.68s)]
*  I was deeply skeptical of the Iraq war at the time. I think I am today in retrospect. I was [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5420.56s)]
*  deeply skeptical that prisoners in Guantanamo Bay should have been denied constitutional due process [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5425.92s)]
*  rights when that's exactly what enshrines the justice system that we otherwise believe in. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5430.88s)]
*  I would pardon Julian Assange. I would pardon Edward Snowden. I've committed to a long list [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5436.8s)]
*  of pardons of people who have taken steps to expose corruption that we otherwise would not [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5442.5599999999995s)]
*  have seen in this country. And I think part of the reason why is there's a weird corporate analogy [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5448.48s)]
*  here. We're talking about companies and finding their purpose and Coinbase. I think there's a [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5453.76s)]
*  version of that going on in the U S military. I think the U S military has lost its sense of [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5458.48s)]
*  purpose actually. And so my view is the purpose of the U S military is to secure Americans on [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5463.6s)]
*  American soil to make sure that we, when necessary, win wars and more importantly deter wars. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5469.12s)]
*  And I think part of what you see in the loss of, you know, people complain about wokeness in the [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5475.36s)]
*  military, et cetera, these are again symptoms of a deeper loss of purpose of an institution, [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5478.88s)]
*  not that much different than a company. But my view is I'm not in the same way with the [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5483.28s)]
*  immigration debate. I don't engage in this. What's the cap, you know, higher or lower. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5487.52s)]
*  It's the wrong debate merit purpose. What are we achieving? I feel the same way about the military. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5493.68s)]
*  It's not a higher lower discussion. It's a, what are we doing discussion. And I think there [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5497.68s)]
*  is a legitimate case for the U S to have and continue to have the strongest military in the [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5502.88s)]
*  world. But I think that deputizing that military to fight wars that are really deflection tactics, [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5507.280000000001s)]
*  often for our own ailments at home, I think it has been a mistake. And we're at risk of making [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5514.0s)]
*  those same mistakes again, right now, most pertinently in Ukraine, unless we learn from [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5519.2s)]
*  those past mistakes. I want to ask you about the division within the Republican party on this, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5524.08s)]
*  specifically Ukraine. So at turning point, which you just spoke at, and I think you did very well [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5528.48s)]
*  in the straw poll there, you had Tucker interviewing Mike Pence, asking him why should we prioritize [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5532.8s)]
*  Ukraine over our own cities that are increasingly broken down? You've got homeless people living on [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5540.8s)]
*  the streets. You've got this price of drug addiction. You've got rampant crime. You've got [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5547.6s)]
*  schools that are terrible. And yet, Ukraine seems to be this fixation of the unit party in Washington. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5552.56s)]
*  And Pence gave this totally dunderheaded answer is something like, that's not my concern, which [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5560.4800000000005s)]
*  I guess his apologists said afterwards that, well, no, he was talking about something else. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5567.68s)]
*  He wasn't saying that American cities weren't his concern, which even if you grant that was the case [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5572.56s)]
*  means that he wasn't really paying attention to Tucker's question. But then you also had Tim Scott [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5577.92s)]
*  say something. It was definitely a better phrase than what Pence said. But basically he said that [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5584.96s)]
*  he thought it was a good idea for us to be giving all this money to Ukraine because degrading [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5590.0s)]
*  Russia's military was a good deal for the United States, by which degrade I assume means killing [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5595.6s)]
*  Russian boys. And you've heard Lindsey Graham say this sort of thing. Then I had this Republican [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5602.0s)]
*  pollster named Patrick Rafini, who I didn't really know before, but he's apparently a Republican [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5608.400000000001s)]
*  pollster. He's got Slava Ukranian in his bio. I'm not quite sure what's motivating that, but he [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5614.96s)]
*  tweeted at me saying that Ukraine is like number 17 on the list of GOP voter priorities, despite [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5620.08s)]
*  efforts by the likes of Carlson and Sachs to make it a thing. Notice how it almost never gets brought [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5625.52s)]
*  up on the trail unless Tucker is there. My response to him was to post a quote from Mitch McConnell [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5631.44s)]
*  saying that Ukraine is the number one priority of the GOP. I'm like, you're making my point for me. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5638.88s)]
*  I know that it's number 17 in the eyes of voters in our party in terms of what they think we should [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5645.36s)]
*  be focused on, but it's number one in the minds of Mitch McConnell and Pence and Scott and Nikki [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5651.759999999999s)]
*  Haley and Lindsey Graham. These people are obsessed with this idea. So I guess, A, what is your [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5659.44s)]
*  reaction to that? B, how are we going to change this? I mean, it just seems like there's something [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5667.28s)]
*  fundamentally broken in our party when the base understands that we should not be focused on Ukraine. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5671.68s)]
*  We should be focused on our own borders, our own cities, as opposed to some far away lands, borders, [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5677.92s)]
*  and cities. Then also in that same turning point poll, 95% of the attendees of that conference [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5683.68s)]
*  were opposed to US involvement in Ukraine. It was the single highest number for anything they [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5692.08s)]
*  pulled on. I think Trump got like an 85% approval. Opposition to Ukraine got 95%. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5698.08s)]
*  So clearly there is a fundamental divide between what the establishment or elite [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5704.08s)]
*  of the party thinks and what the base thinks. What is your explanation for that and how does [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5708.48s)]
*  that ever get solved? I mean, how are we going to fix it? I'm going to give you a facile answer, [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5713.6s)]
*  David. It has to do with why we're doing what we're doing. I want to be elected the next president. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5718.48s)]
*  I think I will be. I think reflecting the will of the people in the way this country is governed [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5724.88s)]
*  is part of how our system is actually supposed to work, both in the primary and in the general [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5730.0s)]
*  election. I know we're sitting in different seats, but I'm sitting in the seat that I am now [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5734.4800000000005s)]
*  precisely because I think somebody needs to actually step up and fix it. When most of the [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5739.52s)]
*  Republican party has locked stock and barrel for all their criticisms of Biden on the most important [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5744.08s)]
*  foreign policy matter of right now, have lock stock and barrel adopted what is effectively [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5749.92s)]
*  the Biden position, which is mysterious and it's interesting. Now, I think that it has become a [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5756.0s)]
*  fixation, not because these candidates I think have arrived at this viewpoint independently [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5765.4400000000005s)]
*  through reasoning their way to it, but just understanding that that's what they are supposed [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5772.16s)]
*  to say in the tradition of a party that was historically based on projecting hard power [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5776.48s)]
*  through deterring the USSR, not recognizing the fact that people sometimes seem to forget this [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5783.2s)]
*  fact, the USSR doesn't exist anymore. And NATO, which was created to contain the USSR has now [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5789.12s)]
*  expanded far more after the fall of the USSR than it did before, which is itself a symptom of a [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5794.639999999999s)]
*  Republican party that still sometimes- So you think it's like a knee-jerk. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5800.32s)]
*  It's like a knee-jerk militarism. It's a muscle memory. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5804.72s)]
*  What about the influence of the military industrial complex? Do you think somehow [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5808.320000000001s)]
*  it's related to donors? What do you mean? Yeah, so I'm very open-minded too, and I'm getting the [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5811.52s)]
*  signal that we're going to this event where we're meeting with parents of kids who have died as a [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5819.76s)]
*  consequence of fentanyl and I don't want to keep them waiting longer than we need to. But [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5827.68s)]
*  you guys are down to do this again. This has been a lot of fun. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5834.72s)]
*  No, this has been great. You gave us 90 minutes. It's fantastic. We can wrap. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5836.64s)]
*  Let me just answer David's last- David, what was your last question? [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5839.280000000001s)]
*  Wait, no, no. I have a better question. Just that last question. Number one, are you vaccinated [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5842.400000000001s)]
*  against COVID? Number two, what do you think of Fauci and what could we have done differently? [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5847.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, you're a man of science, so I'm just curious what you think about the whole thing. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5853.6s)]
*  Great question. So I am vaccinated against COVID. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5857.92s)]
*  Had I had the facts that I do now, as a young, thankfully healthy male, I would not have actually [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5860.88s)]
*  chosen to get vaccinated. I think that Anthony Fauci betrays science by substituting the scientific [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5866.8s)]
*  method, which depends on free speech and open debate and inquiry with authority, which is [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5875.76s)]
*  actually fundamentally anti-scientific at its core. And I think one of our main lessons to have learned [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5881.2s)]
*  from the pandemic, and I hope we do learn it in the future, is that it is precisely in times of [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5886.16s)]
*  emergency that free speech becomes most important. I think if we had been able to debate in the open [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5891.44s)]
*  the merits of lockdowns for children, we would not have locked down our schools. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5896.96s)]
*  I think if we had been able to debate in the open what the origin of the pandemic was, [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5901.36s)]
*  a lab in Wuhan appears to be the overwhelming- it's the truth. I mean, we know that that's exactly the [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5904.639999999999s)]
*  most likely to be correct explanation. It's in the name. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5909.599999999999s)]
*  It literally is, but it was a name you couldn't have said. You couldn't call it, you couldn't [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5913.76s)]
*  name the unspeakable city for which the virus originated. So I think one of the top lessons is [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5918.320000000001s)]
*  free speech and open debate, the path of truth runs through that. Science depends on the free [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5922.320000000001s)]
*  exchange of ideas. That's who we are, and the beauty is our country is founded on that very [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5926.24s)]
*  principle. It's in the First Amendment for a reason. We'll let you get to your event, [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5931.4400000000005s)]
*  but I just want to say thank you for being incredibly dynamic and open and honest. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5936.64s)]
*  It's really great to have guys like you to talk to. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5943.360000000001s)]
*  I appreciate it, guys. If you guys want to do it again, I had a lot of fun too. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5949.200000000001s)]
*  Thanks for not being political, politicians speak and being so honest and taking on every [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5953.360000000001s)]
*  single topic we asked you about. Every single topic. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5958.8s)]
*  That's really great. Very candid. I think you did a great job. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5961.280000000001s)]
*  I appreciate it, guys. Appreciate you. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5963.360000000001s)]
*  Take care, guys. Thank you, Vic. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5964.96s)]
*  We didn't talk about this. Did you guys mention where you are? [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5967.12s)]
*  Based on the number of buttons here, I can tell you I'm in, you know what, I can't talk to myself [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5971.84s)]
*  because, you know, did I ever tell you the story about two years ago when I was in Italy and the [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5977.200000000001s)]
*  stalkers, you fucking told everybody you were there. You know, I didn't everybody was at [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5982.08s)]
*  Chemat's Beach Club. I took a picture of the ocean. It was ridiculous. I took a picture of the ocean [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5987.76s)]
*  and in the corner of one of the towels was the logo of Chemat's Beach Club. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5992.72s)]
*  And some guys found that logo on the towel, did a Google image reverse search, found the beach club [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=5997.36s)]
*  that Chemat's part of, and then showed up at the beach club while I was drinking $150 bottles per [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6005.76s)]
*  second on Chemat's account to pitch me their startup. So I don't want to say exactly where I [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6011.92s)]
*  am. But I'm in Italy, where are you guys? Me and Saks are at shouting distance from each [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6016.48s)]
*  other. We're about to see each other after this. Did I ever tell you guys the story about [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6020.16s)]
*  last summer when I was in Italy, Chamath and I were walking down the streets of Milan. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6023.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Did I ever tell the story? No, no, you didn't tell the story. Okay. This was like the last time [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6029.2s)]
*  that J. Cal and Freebird were having a major feud and it looked like the pod was maybe about to break [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6033.5199999999995s)]
*  up. So, I mean, for real. Break up number one. Yeah, this is breakup number one. We're maybe [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6038.08s)]
*  breaking more two or three. I don't know. You guys were definitely feuding. So we're walking down the [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6043.44s)]
*  street and all of a sudden somebody stops us and he, this is like a fan from, I don't know, like, [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6048.16s)]
*  are you from Australia? He was, he was Australian. He was from Australia. Remember this? He was from [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6055.84s)]
*  Australia visiting Milan. Are you Chamath? And he stops us in the street and takes a photo and the [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6062.16s)]
*  whole thing. And as we're walking away, Chamath says, we better make this thing work because I like being [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6067.44s)]
*  famous. You guys better not screw this up because I like being famous. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6073.2s)]
*  Or being right. Who knows? Who knows? For people who didn't get the joke last week, I love Freebird. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6084.16s)]
*  I'm trying to develop a deep meaningful relationship with Freebird. I love Freebird. What [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6089.84s)]
*  do we think of Vivek? Let's get back to the, you know, brass tax here. RFK versus Vivek. We've now [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6093.28s)]
*  had two of the top five candidates and Chris Christie has agreed to come on. The mooch put me [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6098.0s)]
*  in touch. I have to be honest with you. RFK and he are more similar than they are different on a [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6102.96s)]
*  lot of topics. You know, the contours I think are different on a few very specific ones, obviously. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6108.0s)]
*  But it's like these outsider candidates, I think have like a, they're just a, they're a breath of [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6115.36s)]
*  fresh air because I think and Vivek said it right. The he and RFK, they have nothing to lose. So they [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6121.52s)]
*  just tell you what they think. They don't have to memorize anything because what they think is what [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6127.68s)]
*  they think. And so you just consistently get this stream of consciousness. And the more and more I [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6131.68s)]
*  hear from these kinds of candidates, the more and more they make sense and juxtaposed against the [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6137.12s)]
*  establishment candidates. It's very stark. Would you consider Trump, Sachs, you know, as being the [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6142.72s)]
*  sort of precursor to these two non-traditional candidates. So now we have three non-traditional [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6149.6s)]
*  candidates in the mix. Trump, Vivek and RFK and they all are shoot from the hip. Here's what I [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6153.68s)]
*  honestly think and maybe more moderate and pragmatic in terms of their positions. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6160.400000000001s)]
*  Well, sure. I mean, Trump ran for office for president without having ever run for office [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6165.68s)]
*  before. And so yeah, as a Democrat, he's a Democrat who ran as a Republican too. I mean, [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6171.280000000001s)]
*  and he moved the Republican Party in a bunch of ways that were totally new. Trump's lasting [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6175.84s)]
*  impact I think is going to be on the Republican Party. I mean, he moved the Republican Party from [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6181.52s)]
*  an open borders, completely free trade sort of party. War mongering, neocon. War mongering, [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6185.92s)]
*  knee-jerk militarism, neocon to being anti-war, wanting to have strong borders, being at least [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6193.200000000001s)]
*  skeptical of trade, at least with China, if not other countries. And I think he hasn't wanted to [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6200.080000000001s)]
*  mess with entitlements. He understands that's the third rail and very much against like the Paul Ryan [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6204.56s)]
*  wanting to touch those at least in a non bipartisan way. I think that for the Republicans to take on [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6209.76s)]
*  those issues by themselves, I think he understands us to a side. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6216.96s)]
*  You lose votes when you start taking on entitlements. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6220.400000000001s)]
*  And I think that what Trump also did, which is really interesting is that it cascaded [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6223.12s)]
*  a wave of self reflection in a lot of other Western countries. So Italy's more right. As a result, [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6227.6s)]
*  the UK went right. Spain looks like it's about to tip right. The Dutch actually just lost their [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6234.56s)]
*  election because of national border issues or, you know, they dissolved their government. So [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6239.44s)]
*  there's like a real clear nationalism. Would you say it's more of the nationalist inflection [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6246.48s)]
*  as opposed to the globalist? I mean, that's right. The Overton window, I think, changed quite a bit [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6252.5599999999995s)]
*  with Trump in the mix, because now you actually had this much more America first nationalist [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6257.679999999999s)]
*  orientation as the alternative to this sort of globalist, whether it's neoliberalism or [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6262.24s)]
*  neoconservatism. Those two things have more in common with each other than they do with this [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6267.6s)]
*  more nationalist populist approach. Right. Freebird, what did you think? What was your take? [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6273.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, RFK obviously concerns you a bit because of the I don't want to use the conspiracy word, [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6279.280000000001s)]
*  but let's just call it maybe, you know, he's open minded to he's open minded to different theories. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6284.8s)]
*  So where do you stand on RFK in relation to Vivek today? Freebird? [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6291.6s)]
*  Obviously, I think he's crafted his narrative in a way that can be broadly appealing. And as I [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6296.4s)]
*  mentioned in our tech stream, I think also appeals to the Trump base. In a way, it's a very smart [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6302.799999999999s)]
*  campaign. I think that the strategy, the positioning, everything feels like it's hitting the mood of the [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6308.32s)]
*  moment. And, you know, I would argue like you could probably call any election cycle, any campaign, [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6318.72s)]
*  one of two things, it's a promise of what can I do for you? Or how can I go and destroy the system [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6327.4400000000005s)]
*  that did bad for you? And Trump, RFK, and by the way, the higher the magnitude of that statement, [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6333.84s)]
*  the more appealing the candidate is, I think Vivek is doing a great job [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6343.12s)]
*  hitting a reasonably high magnitude on the, you know, the system has failed us, we need to [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6346.96s)]
*  go and fix these problems kind of moment. And it's really good. But I think it's really good for [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6352.16s)]
*  call it the audience that's engaged in the intellectual debate around it. Not necessarily [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6359.68s)]
*  for Vivek. At this point, I need to spend a little more time with the Santas, to be honest. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6365.44s)]
*  And understand where he sits. I obviously have deep concerns about Biden. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6371.2s)]
*  What would your concerns on Biden be his cognitive issues or the out of control spending? [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6377.12s)]
*  I don't think he's running the country. And I think that those who are, [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6382.56s)]
*  there's absolutely no accountability and discipline in what's going on with respect [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6387.04s)]
*  to spending, as I mentioned, Vivek did not appeal to me and resolving that concern either, by the [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6390.4s)]
*  way, he thinks we're going to grow our way out of it, which is part of the premise of modern monetary [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6394.4s)]
*  theory, which I think it's a flood. So you still don't have a candidate in terms of controlling [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6398.88s)]
*  spending. Yeah. Yeah. Look, I think the problem with Vivek is he's not going to be appealing to [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6403.92s)]
*  the masses because he's so smart and so articulate that it doesn't have the Trump basics. The Trump [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6409.12s)]
*  basics are insult the bad guy, call yourself the best thing in the world, make jokes. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6417.6s)]
*  People might be over that. I think people might be over it. I don't know. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6424.0s)]
*  Good joke. Are people over it? [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6427.28s)]
*  The bullying, the name calling, the bombastic Trump nature. Do you think people are over it? [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6430.72s)]
*  You think that's going to burn people out this election cycle? [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6435.6s)]
*  Well, not if you look at the polls, they're not on the Republican Party. I think in the general, [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6438.88s)]
*  they might. I mean, look, I think right now it looks like we're on track to have a Biden [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6443.6s)]
*  Trump rematch. And right now Biden probably looks like he's going to win. Barring a recession [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6448.56s)]
*  happening or the Ukrainian side collapsing in the war. I mean, that indictment dropping sounds [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6454.4s)]
*  pretty, you know, like another bombshell. So do you think there's any chance? No, no, no, no. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6462.879999999999s)]
*  Okay. So what's your favorite moment, you know, from this discussion? Was there a standout moment [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6469.679999999999s)]
*  for your sacks? We thought. Sorry, I want to hear your question. Chamath, would you vote for him? [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6474.48s)]
*  Are you still in our case camp? Are you kind of still open minded about everything? [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6479.84s)]
*  I wasn't sure what his campaign was about. And, and I come away [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6484.88s)]
*  pretty meaningfully intrigued about what he had to say. I think that there are some fundamental [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6492.32s)]
*  issues that RFK has me on that I wanted Vivek to own. And he, he flirted with them, but he [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6497.92s)]
*  didn't quite own them. Such as? I think that the, just like the deconstruction of the military [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6505.68s)]
*  industrial complex was, is so definitive, you know, of K and it was, it was almost quite there with [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6513.52s)]
*  the fact, but not quite there. So I wish he would, I wish he would own that. I think that [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6519.4400000000005s)]
*  the deconstruction of the department of education, I need to think more about, [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6524.4800000000005s)]
*  but some of his ideas are frankly more compelling. The pro-life pro-choice thing, I think is very [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6528.08s)]
*  complicated. And I think you can go to this place of saying, let the states choose, but I, [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6535.52s)]
*  I'm just not sure whether that's the right ultimate solution. And, you know, proposing some federal [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6540.8s)]
*  legislation. Where would you want to end up on that? You would want to end up like Europe, [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6548.16s)]
*  like a certain number of weeks federally, and then maybe some local laws around abortion and [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6551.52s)]
*  right to choose. I think that there is just like, you have to fundamentally, if you believe in [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6555.84s)]
*  personal freedom, I think having an arbitrary definition of what a person is and then what that [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6562.0s)]
*  freedom means to me is already the slippery slope. And so I have a real issue with that, [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6568.96s)]
*  but I also agree with him about the actual decay of American society. You know, the lack of [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6574.96s)]
*  religious institutions and the lack of family and purpose, those two things above all others, [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6581.44s)]
*  I think, are tearing this country apart. Because people substitute something for it, [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6586.72s)]
*  was his point, right? It's leaving people incredibly empty. And so I just think that you [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6592.0s)]
*  have to have some of these fundamental protections. Sax, what were your favorite moments during this [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6597.4400000000005s)]
*  or moments where you think he stood out or he shine at moments where you maybe have some [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6602.240000000001s)]
*  fundamental disagreement? Well, okay, there's a few issues. Let me respond to so in terms of [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6606.8s)]
*  the vague versus R.F.K. Jr. I think where Kennedy really shines is like Jamal said, [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6613.52s)]
*  when he talks about the military industrial complex. And I would say more generally, [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6619.200000000001s)]
*  R.F.K. has this critique about regulatory capture, which he describes as the marriage of state power [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6624.64s)]
*  and corporate greed. And included in that is what's happened to the FDA and big pharma and the whole [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6630.8s)]
*  government's response on COVID. And then he wraps in censorship as being the way that this [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6638.08s)]
*  R.F.K.'s thoughts are very marriage of corporate greed and state power, the way it defends itself [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6645.04s)]
*  that and that's unacceptable. So I think like on those issues, I don't think anybody speaks as [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6649.28s)]
*  deeply as R.F.K. Jr. Now, when it comes to the list, if you're to like list out all the issues, [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6655.36s)]
*  and where Vivek is and where I am, it's a pretty close match. I mean, I'm not [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6662.5599999999995s)]
*  aligned with him completely on every issue, but I think it would be pretty close. And I do really [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6667.12s)]
*  appreciate where he's coming from on Ukraine. He's not afraid to just come right out and say the truth, [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6671.839999999999s)]
*  which is this is not an important enough American interest to be spending hundreds of billions a [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6678.24s)]
*  year on. I wish we had more time. What an amazing moment. To actually delve into that. And particularly, [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6682.48s)]
*  I wanted him to explain what was happening in the party because there is a divide within the party [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6687.36s)]
*  between these like oxygenary and sort of more establishment Republicans like McConnell, [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6692.72s)]
*  like Scott, like Pence, the war machine, the war machine, and then people like him and Trump, [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6698.16s)]
*  and you put Trump in this category too, who are resisting that. So I would have liked to [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6703.52s)]
*  hear more about that. What did you think of the moment where I kind of pinned him and I said, [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6708.08s)]
*  would you you see you wouldn't defend Ukraine, but you would defend Taiwan. And he said yes, [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6712.16s)]
*  for the next five years, I would defend Taiwan because of the semiconductor. I mean, that I've [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6717.4400000000005s)]
*  never heard a candidate say something that pragmatic. Here's my interpretation. I just [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6721.84s)]
*  like it as cutthroat. Well, it is pragmatic. What he's basically saying is that America right now [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6726.8s)]
*  is dependent on these chips, these very sophisticated, high tech chips, semiconductor chips, [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6731.92s)]
*  and not just like the low end ones, the high end chips, the high that are made in Taiwan, [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6736.72s)]
*  and that is a vital American interest. And until we alleviate ourselves or wean ourselves off that [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6740.72s)]
*  dependency by making them ourselves, we're securing some other supply, then we need Taiwan. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6746.08s)]
*  And so therefore, we cannot allow it to fall into Chinese hands. I'm saying a lot more than he did, [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6752.08s)]
*  but it's kind of an argument like saying chips is the new oil. And as long as this is a critical [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6755.92s)]
*  input into our economy, we have to secure our supply. I can understand that. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6762.72s)]
*  The difference being Bush never said, we're going to the Middle East for oil. He said we're going [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6766.0s)]
*  there for democracy. So that's what I thought was like the very candid moment there, Scott. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6770.72s)]
*  But what always happens is that when America has a vital interest, you always cloak it in [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6774.48s)]
*  liberal rhetoric about rights and freedom and democracy and that kind of thing. But what's [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6780.799999999999s)]
*  frequently driving the decision is American interests underneath. He's being explicit about [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6786.32s)]
*  it. What he's basically saying is as long as America's got this dependency and we need Taiwan, [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6791.28s)]
*  we better defend it and protect it from falling into Chinese hands. But once we don't have that [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6798.4s)]
*  interest, then we don't. I can understand that position. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6802.96s)]
*  That was wild. It was wild. I mean, refreshing for me. I thought it actually was a highlight [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6806.32s)]
*  of the discussion. There's a couple of other things he touched on. So we talked about the [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6810.4800000000005s)]
*  other candidates. I think he's being not disingenuous, but maybe a little bit unfair to [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6813.76s)]
*  DeSantis. I think there's no question that DeSantis alone has been singled out by Trump and not just [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6820.4800000000005s)]
*  Trump, but Trump surrogates to be relentlessly bashed on. And this happens on social media. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6826.64s)]
*  It happens in speeches and talks and all this kind of stuff. So they are going after DeSantis. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6832.16s)]
*  And that has an effect. For a reason, he's number two. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6836.4s)]
*  And Trump clearly has pegged him as the biggest threat and that's why they're targeting him. So [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6840.08s)]
*  that does have an impact. The advantage that someone like Vivek has in a way is that he doesn't [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6845.2s)]
*  have a record as an elected official. And so he can just go out there and speak freely on these [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6852.0s)]
*  issues. And like I described on the show with him, he goes out there and inserts himself in [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6856.64s)]
*  the conversation when an issue is going viral, he jumps in. And I think it's very important that [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6863.04s)]
*  he's doing it so quickly, because if you're a candidate and you wait till the next day, [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6869.92s)]
*  and then the cycle moves on, you missed it. Right? So he's timing it perfectly. So he hits the sweet [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6874.72s)]
*  spot. There's only one way to do it, which is not to have surrogates, not to have a process. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6881.68s)]
*  Not to have a cabinet overthinking it. Well, it's the same thing with our portfolio companies. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6888.08s)]
*  They run it through all these PR people and a PR agency and it gets reviewed. And by the time it [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6892.72s)]
*  goes through his 10th draft, it's too late. It doesn't go viral. So he's running a social [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6899.4400000000005s)]
*  media campaign and it's very effective. Now, I think that DeSantis is running a different [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6903.76s)]
*  kind of campaign. DeSantis actually has a record. I think it's a fantastically successful record [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6908.4s)]
*  as being the most successful governor in the country, running the most successful state in [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6913.5199999999995s)]
*  the country. So he's out there with this idea that, listen, let's make America Florida. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6917.839999999999s)]
*  Yes. So that's what he's campaigning on. And so he is going out there with kind of a pre-determined [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6924.16s)]
*  agenda and a pre-determined stump speech, a playbook. And it's different than someone like [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6930.48s)]
*  Vivek, who's letting the issues come to him and then he's responding as the issues come up. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6935.84s)]
*  That's such a good insight. Vivek is living off the land. And that is- [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6941.2s)]
*  All of that is free media for him. It's free. It's earned media. And Trump did the same thing [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6945.76s)]
*  in 2016, right? Every day he would figure out like, what are the issues today? And he'd go out and [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6950.88s)]
*  speak about them. And you go all the way back to Pat Buchanan working for Richard Nixon back in, [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6956.24s)]
*  I think this was the 72 election or something like that, where every morning Buchanan and there's a [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6962.64s)]
*  couple other speech writers that open the newspaper and find an issue or two. And they would go to [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6966.72s)]
*  Nixon and say, here's your talking points. And so they would find an issue that back in those days [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6972.240000000001s)]
*  was going viral and have the candidate speak to it. So they were nimble. And I think that's what [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6978.56s)]
*  they were doing. And if you want to go viral in the social media era, that's what you have to do. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6983.68s)]
*  You have to lean into the issues that people are talking about that day. And this is the thing is [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6987.2s)]
*  that I think Vivek knows how to do that. Trump clearly knows how to do it. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6993.599999999999s)]
*  RFK knows how to do it. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6996.88s)]
*  RFK definitely knows how to do it. RFK is going viral every day. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=6998.32s)]
*  They're trending topic natives. And that's the difference. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7002.0s)]
*  Freeberg, did you have a highlight or a great moment or two from Vivek? [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7004.8s)]
*  Things that made you go, huh, I really appreciate this person or candidate during the discussion. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7008.4s)]
*  What I appreciated was that we didn't see him like fall down on any topics. And I think that his [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7013.84s)]
*  ability to go through the full discourse with us for however long we went 90 minutes, [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7023.2s)]
*  an hour 40. Yeah, [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7028.4800000000005s)]
*  hour 40 says a lot. You know, RFK Jr. did the same. But again, it's a stark juxtaposition from [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7029.84s)]
*  what I have seen Biden do in terms of interview formats. He has added his interviews are edited. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7036.4800000000005s)]
*  They're short. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7041.4400000000005s)]
*  And so he's able to be able to have this breadth, but also have the data and be able to pull it from [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7042.64s)]
*  the top of his head and not have speaking notes. We gave him no questions ahead of time. There's [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7047.2s)]
*  no agenda. And I think it's great to see a candidate who can engage in that level of discourse, [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7051.04s)]
*  which was important and impressive for me. I just hope it's broadly appealing. And this, [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7058.16s)]
*  by the way, I just want to repeat something I've said many times in the past. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7062.72s)]
*  There are two things I hate about politics. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7066.24s)]
*  Besides the relationship to a growing government. The first is that people pick politics as a career. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7068.24s)]
*  And I think that that's ridiculous. I think people in a democracy should have a private life, [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7075.2s)]
*  and then they should rotate into being civil servants and go and serve. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7080.4s)]
*  It's how the founding fathers interviewed. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7084.24s)]
*  That's right. And so they were, you know, had they had their jobs and their businesses and [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7087.2s)]
*  everything, and they would rotate in and then they would rotate out of government. The fact [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7090.24s)]
*  that people can be a politician for 30 years, they can be a politician for 30 years. And [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7093.2s)]
*  I think it leads to all of the disincentives that have driven to a large government. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7096.4s)]
*  What I appreciate about Vivek and RFK Jr. is that they come at this from, [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7103.44s)]
*  and even Trump, they come at this from private life. And they take their turn in government [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7110.24s)]
*  and rotate out. And that's why I did not get him to answer the question around what would he do [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7114.879999999999s)]
*  besides being president if it didn't work out? What's he going to do next? The second thing I [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7119.28s)]
*  don't like about politics- By the way, just on that point, there's a lot of speculation about that [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7122.96s)]
*  within Republican circles. This is something we just didn't have time to get into. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7127.12s)]
*  Vice president? Let me just finish it. Yeah, let me just finish it and then we'll talk about it. So [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7130.96s)]
*  sorry. Yeah, let's come back to it. But the second thing is just money in politics. And I hate that [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7134.56s)]
*  you can raise money and get votes. Just the general concept that you buy ad space and that [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7138.72s)]
*  you get people to change their vote, I think is the most fucked up. Yeah, I know. But I think it's [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7144.32s)]
*  so fucked up. But what I like about what we just did is we actually had a conversation with the [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7150.16s)]
*  candidate and people can just listen to the conversation. That's the old town square that [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7155.28s)]
*  Sachs talks about that doesn't exist anymore because everything is chopped up and then sold [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7159.04s)]
*  as media bites on paid streams. Whereas what we just did is a free conversation with a guy that [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7163.2s)]
*  anyone can tune in and listen to and learn about him. And that's what I found most compelling is [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7167.599999999999s)]
*  we had a real conversation instead of watching a 30 second ad bite. What's the rumor Sachsie Koo? [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7172.32s)]
*  Yeah, so sorry, go ahead Sachs. The knock on Vivek is that he's basically a Trump surrogate. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7177.2s)]
*  And I mean, Trump has said good things about him. Trump likes him to be out there clearly. I mean, [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7182.4s)]
*  Trump has all but said that. So the idea is that Vivek is out there. And initially, he's doing this [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7187.04s)]
*  less now. But early on, he was just launching broadside after broadside on DeSantis. And so [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7192.8s)]
*  the idea is that he's out there as a Trump surrogate attacking the people Trump wants him to attack [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7198.96s)]
*  on the whole saying good things about Trump, and that he'll be rewarded for that somehow. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7203.4400000000005s)]
*  A cabinet position or vice president position, people even now saying VP because he's doing so [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7208.08s)]
*  well, or maybe he gets an endorsement for a Senate run or something like that. So if we had more time, [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7213.04s)]
*  I would ask him about this like surrogate idea. But I'm sure he would have said no, but- [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7219.2s)]
*  That's why I asked him specifically how much time have you spent with Trump? And when's the last [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7223.04s)]
*  time you talked to him? And he was honest about that. I've only spent like I had dinner with him [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7226.96s)]
*  before I was even a candidate. So wondering if there's some clandestine agreement with them [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7229.84s)]
*  through some back channel for him to do that. I think, well, clearly, his answer would be no, [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7234.8s)]
*  I'm not a surrogate on my own candidate. And he probably is. So my guess on it is that you can [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7242.32s)]
*  go out there and act like a surrogate, knowing that Trump's gonna like it, and then you'll be [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7247.2s)]
*  rewarded. You don't need to have an explicit deal to understand that that would work out for you in [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7252.72s)]
*  that way. Can I respond to Freeberg's point? So Freeberg, you said you don't like the money aspect [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7258.32s)]
*  of politics, and you don't like the sort of careerist aspect of politics. I think what [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7262.4s)]
*  we're seeing with candidates like Vivek or R.F.K. Jr. or Trump is candidates who are bucking those two [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7267.679999999999s)]
*  trends. I mean, clearly, these are not lifelong politicians. They have maybe had a lifelong [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7274.48s)]
*  interest in politics, but they're not lifelong officeholders or candidates for office. And then [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7280.0s)]
*  on the money side, what they're all showing is something that we all know from our portfolio [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7285.92s)]
*  companies, which is that earned media is so much more valuable than paid media. Paid media costs [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7290.4s)]
*  a fortune, and it doesn't really work. No one really wants to look at advertising. They block [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7297.04s)]
*  it out. So you spend a lot of money on advertising, and it never really gets you much compared to [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7302.4s)]
*  earned media, which is you figure out a way to insert yourself in the news cycle by appealing [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7307.2s)]
*  to people on issues that are being talked about. You figure out how to kind of hit your wagon to, [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7312.24s)]
*  like you said, Jason, a trending topic. And that's what all three of these candidates have done, [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7316.48s)]
*  and it works so well. And I think that sort of the career politicians who are proceeding in this very [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7320.4s)]
*  kind of playbook way, which is we're going to go out, we're going to raise the most money from [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7326.08s)]
*  donors, then we're going to buy the most TV time, and we're going to be on message. I mean, we're [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7329.76s)]
*  only going to talk about the things we want to talk about. The problem is that doesn't work anymore [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7335.12s)]
*  because earned media is so much more valuable than paid media. Well, look, I hope that's a trend, [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7339.28s)]
*  and I hope it flushes the money out of the system and that candidates win based on the merit of the [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7343.44s)]
*  conversation that they have in earned media, instead of buying more ad space on paid media, [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7347.92s)]
*  and that it changes the game. And I hope that the laws change too. And I also hope that the laws [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7353.36s)]
*  change with respect to career politicians and term limits and all that sort of stuff, because this [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7357.759999999999s)]
*  whole career system and money in this thing is what's driving so much. It's one of the contributors [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7361.84s)]
*  to inflation and government spending and government accountability and all the nonsense that goes on. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7366.72s)]
*  And I would love to see a change. I think the earned media is so valuable now that I think [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7371.360000000001s)]
*  candidates who try to stay on their message on their agenda, it's going to cost too much money. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7375.52s)]
*  It's basically an unsustainable path. I would urge all the Republican candidates, [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7382.160000000001s)]
*  including DeSantis, just to get out there. By the way, DeSantis is a tremendously smart man. I mean, [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7386.56s)]
*  he went to Harvard. He's a lawyer. Where is he? Yeah. To be fair, I haven't asked him yet. But [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7391.76s)]
*  why? Yeah. What's going on? Chris Christie's coming on. Last time I asked him to do something, [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7398.320000000001s)]
*  we had technical difficulties. Remember that? It didn't go over too well. Just for the record, [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7402.88s)]
*  the mooch who loves the fact that a unit of time has been named after him from USags. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7408.08s)]
*  Any 11 day period is known as a mooch. So if you have a little. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7414.72s)]
*  It's a scary moochie. It's a moochie. It's a moochie. Yeah. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7418.320000000001s)]
*  Love that. But he, he literally introduced me to governor Chris Christie over text. So I'm in touch [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7421.839999999999s)]
*  with Chris Christie is coming on the pod. So that's three of the top six or five in terms of polling. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7429.12s)]
*  I'll ask DeSantis to come on. We'll never get Biden because he'll fall asleep. I don't think [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7433.44s)]
*  Biden can do 45 minutes without a nap. Don't insult the guy that might show up. Let's see [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7437.5199999999995s)]
*  if we can get him. I think he may, you know, he may get Biden. I don't know. Let's, let's not. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7441.679999999999s)]
*  I can ask. I can ask. I mean, let's try and get Biden. I mean, it would be great. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7447.04s)]
*  We can get half an hour with him and he can have a real conversation with us. I'd be thrilled. Be [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7451.2s)]
*  really interesting. Well, by the way, just did freed Zikaria. It was an interview that was pretty [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7455.6s)]
*  much localized to talking about foreign policy in Ukraine. And he also did that other woman on MSNBC. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7461.44s)]
*  They're all canned. He gets the questions ahead of time. Yeah. And then they edit it for him. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7468.56s)]
*  So he gets post-production, which, you know, then you could shape the thing however you want [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7473.04s)]
*  and shame on the media for doing that. Honestly, to the left media, you're not helping the democracy [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7477.5199999999995s)]
*  here in the United States by, you know, putting the fix in for Biden. If he can't do the interview, [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7483.04s)]
*  if he can't handle an hour at least, then can he be the president? I mean, let's be honest here. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7487.84s)]
*  Well, they'll get the ratings. Just in terms of debrief, was there anything we want to say about [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7493.92s)]
*  the whole banking crisis? I appreciate that he tried to find common ground with us. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7498.0s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. I nearly made a joke that you were now going to do a fundraiser for him after that. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7503.28s)]
*  No, I mean, listen, he said it himself, I'm going to respond to everything one out of 100 times, [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7508.88s)]
*  I may change my position based on new information, which by the way, we do here every week. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7513.76s)]
*  Every week, we all listen to each other. We have vibrant debate. And sometimes we change our [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7518.64s)]
*  positions. You know, like I think that's what any reasonable person does. Go ahead. Yeah, I mean, [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7522.96s)]
*  look, I don't think we were that far apart from him on this whole banking crisis. I mean, I think [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7526.88s)]
*  we all agree that there should be no bailout for the shareholders and the bondholders of these [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7531.52s)]
*  banks that are poorly managed and go under. And I think that the vague did endorse a proposal, [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7536.56s)]
*  which we I think Jason, you and I both come up with, which was to have a higher level of FDIC [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7544.4800000000005s)]
*  insurance for business banking. I think it was like 10 million or something like that. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7551.4400000000005s)]
*  And you know what, include that in the cost of the insurance. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7555.84s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. It's just paid by the premiums of these banks for banking insurance. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7558.959999999999s)]
*  And Vivek had this point about, you know, if Roku is stupid enough to keep 500 million in a [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7562.799999999999s)]
*  checking account, and the bank goes under, maybe they should lose it. It's like, okay, [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7566.959999999999s)]
*  my goal is not to save Roku if they're stupid enough to manage the money that poor. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7570.639999999999s)]
*  To save the local school. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7574.4s)]
*  Really, the only difference is that and I think Freeberg, you hit the nail on the head, [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7576.0s)]
*  is when you have a bank run underway, you have to stop it before the panic can spread. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7580.719999999999s)]
*  Contagion is real. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7586.0s)]
*  The contagion was absolutely real. I don't think people outside Silicon Valley could understand [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7587.2s)]
*  that because they weren't in those Friday morning emergency phone calls and board meetings [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7590.8s)]
*  that were happening. So we know it was, it had already moved so far beyond SVB. At that point, [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7597.2s)]
*  we had founders moving their money out of First Republic and all these other banks. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7603.12s)]
*  Thursday and Friday. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7606.88s)]
*  On Thursday and Friday. And they wanted to go to the top four banks. And if it wasn't a Sib, [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7607.92s)]
*  it wasn't good enough. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7611.92s)]
*  If it wasn't called Silicon Valley Bank, this would have been a totally different thing. And [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7612.88s)]
*  if it hadn't been us raising the alarm, let's be self aware. People hate [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7616.16s)]
*  Silicon Valley tech. There's this contingent of people who hate Silicon Valley tech and rich [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7619.68s)]
*  people. And they were just gleeful. You know, there's 20% of the sort of far left communist [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7623.68s)]
*  socialist, you know, idiots, who mids Elizabeth Warren's, whoever's who are just like, Oh, great [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7629.599999999999s)]
*  Silicon Valley is getting kicked in the nuts. They were thrilled to see it. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7636.16s)]
*  Right. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7639.5199999999995s)]
*  That was that was short and Freud. All right, we got to wrap. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7640.32s)]
*  Hey, pull up these pictures real quick. This is your five second science corner. Look, [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7642.88s)]
*  these are photos taken on Mars yesterday. How cool is this? That's all I had to say. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7646.8s)]
*  Oh, those that's exactly the chances of taking a photo on Mars are 3,721,000,000. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7650.24s)]
*  If you can see, this looks just like this. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7656.24s)]
*  So they're taken on those are from Uranus. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7658.16s)]
*  Yeah, those are from Mars. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7660.88s)]
*  Very similar to the photos I took last night. I took my iPhone 14 and I squatted down and took [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7661.84s)]
*  pictures of these tingle berries into a mirror. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7669.2s)]
*  And I said, look at what's going on down there. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7671.36s)]
*  These these boulders are very similar to the tingle berries. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7674.16s)]
*  What are these? It taint my balls and it taint my butt. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7677.36s)]
*  It's my taint. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7680.5599999999995s)]
*  If you look at those two boulders, those are similar to my huge balls. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7681.2s)]
*  You guys can't put this out. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7686.4s)]
*  I love you guys. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7690.88s)]

*  It is incredible. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7693.92s)]
*  Yes. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7695.12s)]
*  Pretty amazing. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7695.36s)]
*  I mean, look at that. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7696.0s)]
*  And how cool are those photos? [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7696.88s)]
*  We should have had two episodes this week since there were so many good topics for us to talk [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7698.5599999999995s)]
*  about. But listen, we didn't talk about any of the topics, but yeah, that was good. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpC6c6iYji8&t=7702.16s)]
