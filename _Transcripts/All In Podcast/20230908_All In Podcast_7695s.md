# In conversation with Chris Christie
**All In Podcast:** [September 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk)
*  All right, everybody. Welcome back to the all in podcast. We're very excited today to do our third [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=0.0s)]
*  deep dive long form discussion with presidential candidates for the 2024 election started with [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5.84s)]
*  RFK. And he got a huge boost in the ratings after it was on the pod. We had the vague and now [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=11.84s)]
*  Governor Chris Christie is with us Governor. Thanks for coming. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  My pleasure. Thanks for having me guys. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=21.76s)]
*  All right. So it's a little bit different here than I think some of the other news hits that you do. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=23.84s)]
*  This is not short form. It's long form. We like to, you know, have a thoughtful discussion [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=28.64s)]
*  with the candidates, not with talking points. And I know that you're a straight shooter. So I think [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=34.88s)]
*  you'll fit right in here with the other boys. I think you're very unique amongst candidates that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=40.0s)]
*  you've actually brought up the deficit, as we know, just two facts here. And then I'll [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=45.36s)]
*  hand it over to Freiburg for his question. Last two administrations have run up the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=50.56s)]
*  deficit massively. Here's a chart of our debt. Trump added almost a trillion. Biden's added four [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=56.88s)]
*  trillion. And this is obviously an unpopular issue to bring up. As you've mentioned, bringing this [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=64.4s)]
*  up is unpopular. It doesn't get you votes necessarily to say we have to cut spending. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=71.60000000000001s)]
*  And Freiburg and I are very much I'll speak for myself. This is my number one issue in terms of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  picking a candidate. Freiburg, I think you said it's your number one issue. So Freiburg, I'll [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=81.68s)]
*  hand it over to you in terms of a question for Governor Christie. Yeah, Governor Christie, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=85.2s)]
*  nice to see you. You and I sang on a karaoke stage together in Idaho a few years ago. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  But it's I do remember that. Yeah. Is that a sly way of saying Idaho? I had to put that two and two [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=95.2s)]
*  together there. Nice, Freiburg. It was a small bar in Idaho. Small bar in Idaho. Small gathering. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=101.44s)]
*  Establishment classes. Small gathering with a few folks who happen to be in a bar together. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=108.4s)]
*  At the b conference that shall not be named. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=113.52s)]
*  We watched the Republican primary debate a few weeks ago. And I think what struck me at least [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=134.24s)]
*  was how little focus and attention is given on the fiscal situation. The U.S. government [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=140.64s)]
*  deficit in excess of $2 trillion this year, debt to GDP in excess of 130%. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=147.76s)]
*  30 plus percent of U.S. debt is coming to you in the next year, which means it's going to get [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=154.72s)]
*  refinanced at the higher rates at probably five and a half percent plus. And then when you look [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=159.04s)]
*  at the demands on Social Security, Medicare forecasts are that both of those systems [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=162.72s)]
*  necessarily go bankrupt unless there's some extraordinary measures taken. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=169.36s)]
*  And that seems to be a very kind of hot topic, golden goose that can't be touched or debated. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  All of this seems to be largely ignored. And so much of the conversation is around social issues [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=180.0s)]
*  in the United States. Military issues, war, et cetera, when fundamentally there's no gas in the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=185.52s)]
*  tank. I guess the point of view I'd love to hear from you is how do you think about that? Does that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=192.0s)]
*  matter to you right now? Or do we think that this is a can that we kick down the road and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=196.96s)]
*  we'll solve this problem later, we'll grow our way out of it? If we cut some spending, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=201.36s)]
*  it'll fix itself. It seems so core to me that the future of the United States is going to be [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  dependent on how we're going to manage this fiscal emergency that we're facing. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=211.44s)]
*  Well, look, David, it's core to me too. And I'm, you know, if you've seen any of the excerpts from [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=215.36s)]
*  any of the town hall meetings I've done so far, you know, I've been talking about both the issues [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=220.88s)]
*  you just raised. First off, I think on the deficit and debt side, I learned about this [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=225.84s)]
*  after becoming a prosecutor and having to come to New Jersey and inherit two problems immediately. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=234.96s)]
*  We had a $2 billion short-term deficit for the last five months of the fiscal year that I inherited. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=241.44s)]
*  And then we had an $11 billion deficit on a $29 billion budget for the fiscal year starting July 1 [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=248.0s)]
*  of 2010. And I had to deal with both those things. And as you know, unlike the chart that was just [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=255.44s)]
*  shown, you don't get to run it up. You have to square it. And so, you know, I learned how hard [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  it is and how ugly it's going to be for your popularity to do these things. So on the first [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  piece, on the $2 billion, we sat down, I refused to raise taxes, and we sat down and we eliminated [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=275.68s)]
*  683 individual programs completely, and then swept every surplus from a school board in the state. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=282.24s)]
*  And the way we did that was we reduced their state aid by the amount they had in surplus [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=291.76s)]
*  to get the $2 billion in balance. And then extended that into the next budget cycle, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=298.64s)]
*  kept all those cuts in place, which did some structural, you know, refiguring of the deficit, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=307.76000000000005s)]
*  and then made additional cuts. After that, you know, I'd gotten elected with 48.5% of the vote. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  And after I did that, my approval ratings went down below 40 in my first six months. But what I [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=321.6s)]
*  knew was it was absolutely necessary, because in our state, we were already overtaxed. And the idea [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  of raising taxes again was not an option that was to me viable. So when you learn and you go [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=336.32s)]
*  through that process, and then you look at what we're dealing with federally, I think you realize [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=342.32s)]
*  three things right off the bat. One, it is an imperative that we need to reduce spending. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=347.59999999999997s)]
*  What it's doing to inflation and the long term ability of the country to grow, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=353.68s)]
*  it makes it absolutely necessary to, to me, kicking the can down the road is not an option, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=358.56s)]
*  because the problems only going to get worse. And, and it's going to begin to impact our ability [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=364.96s)]
*  to be able to do some of the core things that government is supposed to do. And then third, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  that you've got to be willing to sacrifice popularity for results. And, you know, I'm not [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=377.44s)]
*  going to sit here and say it'll be fun to do. It won't be, but I went through it once already on [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=386.24s)]
*  a smaller scale. And quite frankly, you have a much longer runway to do it at the federal level [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=390.96s)]
*  than I did at the state level. And I had no hard deadlines of, you know, June 30, 2010, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  and July 1, 2010 to accomplish both on the entitlement side. I think I'm the only person [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=404.24s)]
*  who's been talking about this and saying out loud, we've got to consider raising retirement age, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=411.2s)]
*  and we've got to consider means testing and eligibility for social security. And, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=417.44s)]
*  you know, those also, you know, I remember watching Biden's [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=424.4s)]
*  State of the Union address. And to me, the most disgusting part of it was when he said, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=428.32s)]
*  Can we all agree? We're not going to touch social security. And both sides stood up and cheered. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=431.92s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. That was the that was the worst moment for me as well. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=436.71999999999997s)]
*  Liars and liars and hypocrites, like they all know, it's going broken 11 years. And that's an [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=439.92s)]
*  automatic 24% benefit cut on the social security side, an automatic 25% Medicare benefit cut [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=445.12s)]
*  on that side. So you're not going to be have to you're not going to be able to let that happen. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=452.24s)]
*  And so you got to deal with those issues. And I think you can deal with them through both eligibility [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=456.88s)]
*  issues regarding means testing. And you can deal with it by also dealing with retirement age, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=463.92s)]
*  retirement age, I would do it over the longer term, not for people in their 50s and 60s currently, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=470.32s)]
*  but for people in their 40s and below. And let me just say one follow up, because to your point, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=475.6s)]
*  I think the recent polling showed something like 83% plus of Americans support the benefit they get [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=481.68s)]
*  from these two programs, social security and Medicare that it should not be touched that that [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=488.24s)]
*  is the popular opinion. That is what the voters are saying. Do you not think that you put yourself [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  at risk in your campaign by making these statements? And how do you get elected and [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=497.52s)]
*  instigate change? I put myself at risk by running. Yeah, let alone put myself at risk. I just think [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=503.59999999999997s)]
*  you have to be honest with people. It's 11 years, it's not 20 years, it's 11 now. And it means that [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=510.79999999999995s)]
*  if the next president doesn't deal with it, then it is going to be in absolute crisis mode when it [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=517.76s)]
*  has to be dealt with, will be inside three years. And at that point, the options will be even fewer. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=524.24s)]
*  So yeah, of course, it's and I know someone will run a commercial. Is that the part is that the [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=530.88s)]
*  behind closed door conversation? Is that what's going on is the folks that you know, that you [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=535.36s)]
*  talk with everyone behind the closed door, when they're not in front of the camera are saying we [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=539.6s)]
*  are going to have to deal with this in the next presidential administration? Yeah, yeah. But, but [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=544.0799999999999s)]
*  but they all say, I can't believe you're saying it out loud. Right. But you know, to me, we are in [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=549.04s)]
*  such a bad place in politics in this country. If we don't start telling the people the truth about [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=555.2s)]
*  the problems we have, we're never gonna have an opportunity to solve them. And that's that's [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=561.5200000000001s)]
*  risky. But my entire candidacy is risky. So, you know, you might as well just go for it and tell [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=567.2s)]
*  people what you really think. And I do think there are a number of people out there are thinking [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=573.0400000000001s)]
*  people. I think most people who answer that 83% number, you know, David is our people who [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=577.2800000000001s)]
*  don't even know that we're 11 years away from insolvency. Because nobody talks about that part. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=585.76s)]
*  And and if you don't talk about that part, why would any of them want social security touched? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=593.0400000000001s)]
*  But I'm finding in my town hall meetings, when I tell people it's 11 years from insolvency, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=598.24s)]
*  how would you deal with a 25% cut 24% cut in your social security benefit? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  People older folks in particular look horrified. And so, you know, I think it's an educational [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=609.52s)]
*  process. And I've always tried to treat politics at least in part that way, that, you know, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=616.9599999999999s)]
*  you know, something I say, New Jersey all the time, when press would ask me about a poll that [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=623.8399999999999s)]
*  didn't like a position I was taking on an issue, I'd say, you know, a leader's job is not to follow [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=628.0799999999999s)]
*  polls is to change them. And in my job is to change them. And to persuade and convince [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=633.9200000000001s)]
*  through facts and argument that this is the right way to go. And sometimes you'll win and sometimes [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=640.88s)]
*  you won't. But if you don't tackle the problems, what the hell are you doing there? You know, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=645.52s)]
*  the housing behind you is nice. But, you know, frankly, it's not worth it to me, if I'm going [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=652.24s)]
*  to go there and just be another one to kick this can down the road, as you know, Obama, Trump and [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=658.0s)]
*  Biden have all done. Bush tried to do something about it. And the Congress rejected it. But [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=666.24s)]
*  Obama, you know, Trump and Biden have done nothing. What are your top two areas where you would cut [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=671.92s)]
*  in order to save entitlements? What are the other areas where you would go to find savings? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=678.48s)]
*  Well, look, I think I think we have to look at social spending in general. That's really [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=684.32s)]
*  drastically increased post COVID. And those increases have not been taken back. So I think [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=691.6s)]
*  you have to look at all the programs that were ramped up during COVID and say, Okay, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=697.36s)]
*  what's it going to be to bring it back to pre COVID spending to start? And then after you do that, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=704.48s)]
*  a further evaluation of those programs to see if they're effective. And I think that would get you [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=711.2800000000001s)]
*  a good part of the way they're given how much spending increased during COVID. I think secondly, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=717.6s)]
*  we need to look at the way we fund education in this country as well. And whether or not when [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=726.1600000000001s)]
*  we're spending 800 billion, what do we do with the 80 billion the federal government spends? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=732.48s)]
*  Another place an interesting place to look small in comparison to a $2 trillion debt, I understand. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=740.16s)]
*  But that's another place I would look. And the only place I really wouldn't look is on the military [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=747.52s)]
*  side at this point, because I think you've got to increase efficiency and effectiveness at the [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=753.28s)]
*  Pentagon. But on the other hand, I don't think that this is the time to be cutting back there [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=758.56s)]
*  when our Navy and Air Force are both the conditions they're in. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=765.84s)]
*  It's a good segue with the military. Obviously, one of the major differences in thinking on this [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=768.48s)]
*  pod and you know, a big debate inside the Republican Party is around, should we defend Ukraine? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=775.6800000000001s)]
*  And then eventually, will we defend, you know, Taiwan? And so maybe I'll hand it off to David, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=783.44s)]
*  I'm stunned that this is coming up on your pod. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=789.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's it's a point of contention. I think I won't speak for sacks. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=792.3199999999999s)]
*  Have you heard our pod before, Governor? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=797.5999999999999s)]
*  Yes, sir. As does my my oldest son, listen to it. So in times when I miss my son, Andrew is, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=799.52s)]
*  and he wanted to give me a full briefing before I was going to go on the pod today. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=807.76s)]
*  And his evaluation of all of you. I told him I was going to refrain from that, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=813.04s)]
*  because I didn't want to bring his biases into the interview. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=817.68s)]
*  Can you at least tell us what his evaluations were? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=821.28s)]
*  Well, after afterwards, I will. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=823.52s)]
*  Absolutely. Well, OK. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=826.48s)]
*  By the way, our path to presidential candidates is through the sons, it seems. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=827.6s)]
*  It's kind of a comment. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=831.6s)]
*  It's actually our case sons very big into the pod. David, of course, is a pacifist. He's a long [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=832.4s)]
*  time GOP member, but doesn't believe we should be fighting never ending wars. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=838.64s)]
*  Let me go back. Yeah, let me level set here on foreign policy first, before we get into Ukraine. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=842.72s)]
*  I want to go back to the Bush era, forever wars, the Iraq war. One of the reasons why Trump, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=847.5999999999999s)]
*  I think, really took off in 2016 is he was the first Republican to really come out and say [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=853.68s)]
*  that the Iraq war and all these Middle Eastern forever wars we got into was a big mistake. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=860.4s)]
*  Even though he was even though he's for it when we did it. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=865.1999999999999s)]
*  OK, well, fair enough. But he said on the trail and hold on. Let me finish the question. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=867.92s)]
*  In 2016, he said that Bush lied us into the war and he said no more bushes. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=871.68s)]
*  Putting aside Trump for a second, we can get to Trump. What is your view on it? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=876.64s)]
*  Do you fundamentally agree with that that we were lied into the Iraq war? Do you defend it? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=880.96s)]
*  No, I think that I think that most people would admit that we were misled. I wouldn't use the word [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=886.24s)]
*  lied. I would say misled into the Iraq war because of the WMD issue. I mean, I supported [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=891.52s)]
*  the Iraq war because of WMD. And I thought if Saddam Hussein had WMD, that that was something [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=899.04s)]
*  that we had to deal with in the context of the post 9-11 world. When it turned out that he didn't [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=906.08s)]
*  have WMD, I don't think there would have been many people who would have been supportive of the Iraq [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=912.48s)]
*  war absent WMD. So I thought Trump's statements in 2016 were typical for him. He changed his opinion. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=917.5200000000001s)]
*  And instead of giving a rational reason for it, he gave a sophomoric one. And so I don't give him a [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=928.1600000000001s)]
*  whole lot of credit for that. But what you did at the time in a sense, I mean, when Bush Bush said, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=934.48s)]
*  sorry, Trump said that Bush lied to us in the Iraq war at the South Carolina debate that was on February [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=940.16s)]
*  13th. You endorsed him on February 26. Yeah. So what's that mean? Well, I mean, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=944.88s)]
*  if you thought his answer was sophomoric, why'd you endorse him two weeks later? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=952.08s)]
*  I endorsed him because I was convinced he was going to be the Republican nominee for president. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=955.44s)]
*  And I didn't want Hillary Clinton to be the president. And so having been in that race, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=960.4s)]
*  competed with him after he won South Carolina, convinced he was going to be the nominee. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=965.84s)]
*  And having at that time had a 15 year relationship with him. My view was I could go in there and try [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=970.4s)]
*  to make him a better candidate. And if you want a better president, and that's why I endorsed him, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=975.1999999999999s)]
*  absolutely nothing to do with his sophomoric answer on that. I didn't like his answer on the wall, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=979.4399999999999s)]
*  either saying Mexico was going to pay for it. I thought that was sophomoric as well. But you know [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=985.1999999999999s)]
*  what? In American politics, you don't get to all vote for the candidate you want to vote for. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=989.92s)]
*  You get to vote for the ones who are left. And if I had my first choice in 16, it would have been me. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=996.24s)]
*  But that didn't work out. So I defaulted into Trump because I thought he was a better choice [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1002.4799999999999s)]
*  than Hillary Clinton. And by the way, still do think he was a better choice than Hillary Clinton. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1007.92s)]
*  Okay. But you probably agree with that, right, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1011.92s)]
*  Sachs? You thought Trump would be a better choice than Hillary Clinton. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1014.24s)]
*  I mean, honestly, back in 2016, I wasn't sure what to make of Trump because he was such a, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1018.4s)]
*  you know, outsider and sort of a wrecking ball. I agree with him about the Iraq war. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1022.5600000000001s)]
*  But I can accept the governor's answer that we were misled on that war. And if we had known [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1028.08s)]
*  the truth about it, we never would have gotten into it. So I think we can all agree on that. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1032.96s)]
*  Yep. I want to get to Ukraine, but just quickly, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1036.88s)]
*  2012, do you regret not running in 2012? There's a lot of commentators who say that [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1040.24s)]
*  you kind of were the Trump before Trump, you had this combative style, this kind of take no prisoners [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1045.92s)]
*  sort of attitude. And you kind of had a moment in 2012 where it looked like maybe you could have [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1050.8s)]
*  been the front runner or the candidate. I guess why didn't you go for it in 2012? And I mean, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1057.28s)]
*  do you regret that at all? I don't regret it. And I wasn't ready to be president. And that's why I [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1062.64s)]
*  didn't run. I know it seems quaint now after Barack Obama and Donald Trump have been president. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1067.28s)]
*  But, you know, back in 2012, I really felt like it was necessary to feel in your heart and your [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1074.72s)]
*  mind. You were ready. When people started talking about me running for president, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1080.3999999999999s)]
*  I hadn't even been governor for a year. And before that, I've been a prosecutor. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1086.32s)]
*  And in my heart, I just David, you know, it just didn't feel like I was ready to be president. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1092.1599999999999s)]
*  And if I don't feel something in here, I'm not gonna be very effective at making the argument [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1098.24s)]
*  politically. Norma could be able to convince people to give me their money, which you need to [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1105.1999999999998s)]
*  do as well. And so no, I don't regret it. And by the way, you know, all those commentators who say [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1109.6799999999998s)]
*  that never ran for a goddamn thing in their lives. And, you know, they all can think, oh, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1114.9599999999998s)]
*  you would have won, you would have beaten Romney, and you would have beaten Obama. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1119.92s)]
*  Maybe I would have maybe I wouldn't have. But that's kind of like the dog catching the garbage [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1123.92s)]
*  truck. If you don't think you're ready, and you catch it, the worst moment wouldn't have been [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1128.16s)]
*  losing that election, the worst moment might have been winning it. And getting into the Oval Office [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1134.48s)]
*  for the first time and saying, Oh, my God, am I really ready to do this? So I don't have any [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1138.8000000000002s)]
*  regrets. I really don't. And, and everybody who usually, you know, commentates in that way, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1143.92s)]
*  are people who have never put their name on a ballot for anything. And until you do that, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1151.28s)]
*  you don't know what it feels like and what it means to have to offer yourself up to people [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1155.92s)]
*  for anything, let alone for president. Yeah, okay, fair enough. Going chronologically here, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1161.8400000000001s)]
*  2014, Biden is now Obama's vice president, he requests the Ukraine portfolio to run it for [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1168.4s)]
*  Obama. There is a famous phone call that gets leaked where our deputy Secretary of State Victoria [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1175.0400000000002s)]
*  Nuland is on tape picking the new government of Ukraine, which takes effect a few weeks later [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1180.64s)]
*  after the violent overthrow of the democratically elected Ukrainian government, the Yanukovych [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1186.48s)]
*  government. Three months after that, Hunter Biden is appointed to the board of barisma. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1191.8400000000001s)]
*  Do you believe that that appointment was made for any other reason than Joe Biden was the de facto [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1197.6s)]
*  ruler of Ukraine? I don't know about him being the de facto ruler of Ukraine. I mean, he was the one. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1204.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't think Joe Biden is the fact a ruler of anything, but they clarify what I mean by that. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1212.48s)]
*  On the on the Victoria, on the Victoria Nuland phone call, she says she needs to get approval [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1217.36s)]
*  from Biden and Jake Sullivan is national security advisor for this new Ukrainian government that [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1223.92s)]
*  she's picking. So she basically is saying that Biden is the boss. He's going to sign off on this. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1229.76s)]
*  They apparently get the approval from Biden and that government does go into effect after what [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1236.16s)]
*  appears to be a US backed coup. So Biden clearly has enormous influence over that country. Not okay. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1241.52s)]
*  It's or or Jake's or Jake Sullivan or Jake Sullivan. So look, it's too glib to say he's [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1250.08s)]
*  the ruler of the country. So I don't mean that. I just mean he's the ultimate authority. It seems [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1254.48s)]
*  like in approving or picking this new government three months after he does that Hunter Biden's [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1259.12s)]
*  appointed to the board of barisma. So my point to you is what reason could there be for a Hunter [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1266.08s)]
*  Biden's appointment other than Joe Biden's influence over that country? None. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1270.72s)]
*  There you have it. What else you want me to say? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1275.28s)]
*  So a year later, so 2015, I don't know why Sachs became a venture capitalist. He should have been [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1280.72s)]
*  a prosecutor. Absolutely. It's just incredible. I'm overwhelmed at the moment as a former prosecutor. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1285.84s)]
*  Oh my God. You're on the ropes. I'm just, I'm trying to get to the present day. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1293.92s)]
*  Sachs flip to page 13. Yeah, come on. No, no, no, I want to get, I want to get, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1298.08s)]
*  this is a four hour podcast. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1303.28s)]
*  We're going to go day by day over the last decade. Hunter Biden's common ground. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1307.52s)]
*  I want to stop 14 years old on the middle school playground and you push that kid, Bobby, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1313.12s)]
*  what were you thinking? No, I'm actually establishing common ground with the [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1317.84s)]
*  governor before I get into areas who might disagree. Okay. Okay. Here we go. So, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1321.6s)]
*  okay. So 2015, you have this prosecutor named Shokin, this Ukrainian prosecutor who is [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1326.08s)]
*  investigating Burisma. Joe Biden, according to his own acknowledgement on a videotape to, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1331.92s)]
*  I think he was speaking to the council of foreign relations, says that he gets Shokin fired. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1338.24s)]
*  And then magically the investigation into Burisma stops. Do you think that was in [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1342.64s)]
*  furtherance of stopping corruption in Ukraine or was that an effort by Joe Biden to protect himself [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1347.76s)]
*  or his son from this investigation? I think we're going to find out as continued congressional [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1353.76s)]
*  oversight occurs and the special counsel, I hope investigation broadens. So I'm not ready to say, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1360.08s)]
*  I know that for sure, but I'll tell you this much, there's enough smoke there that we got to see [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1367.04s)]
*  where the fire is. And, and I'd also say about Biden, I would never discount, not as a substitute [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1372.32s)]
*  motivation, but perhaps as an additional one, the fact that he likes to pretend he's in charge of [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1380.24s)]
*  things. Um, but instead his staff is really in charge and that's how you get trained in the [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1385.76s)]
*  United States Senate. Your staff really runs everything. Um, at least with many of the senators [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1392.56s)]
*  and that's why it's such a bad, um, training ground for the presidency in my view. But I, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1398.8s)]
*  I digress myself. Um, I'd say it is a likely motivation. It may not be the only one. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1404.96s)]
*  And it's something I'm certainly intrigued to find out about, um, as oversight moves forward. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1412.4s)]
*  And I hope the special counsel's investigation broadens into the specifics of then vice president [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1417.1200000000001s)]
*  Biden's involvement with his son's business dealings. Let's talk about that for a second. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1424.4s)]
*  There is, I guess the most recent revelation is that Joe Biden was communicating with his son under, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1428.96s)]
*  under a pseudonym or a burner account. Was it Robert Peters? In your experience as a prosecutor, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1434.4s)]
*  is there any legitimate reason why somebody would want to use a pseudonym for communicating [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1440.64s)]
*  with their son? Um, look, uh, burner accounts always raise my eyebrows, um, as a former prosecutor. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1446.16s)]
*  But what I will say is that I would understand someone in public life, if they're communicating [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1454.64s)]
*  with family, wanting to do that in a way where it wouldn't be detected by folks who are prying in [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1460.4s)]
*  one way or the other, whether that might be media, but more particularly hackers and other folks [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1467.92s)]
*  who are able to do things that I really don't have much understanding of except to be fearful [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1474.0800000000002s)]
*  of them. Um, so I don't want to say that as a de facto proof point, David, but again, going back [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1478.72s)]
*  to my seven years as a U S attorney, um, when I saw someone having a burner phone or other types [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1486.72s)]
*  of burner accounts, definitely made me say, let's take a look a little more closely at that and see [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1492.88s)]
*  what we can find. So at a minimum, at a minimum, it's suspicious for sure. It deserves inquiry. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1497.44s)]
*  Yeah. Especially after Biden said he had no involvement with the son's business dealings. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1504.8s)]
*  And we found out from Devin Archer sworn testimony who is Hunter Biden's partner, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1507.92s)]
*  that Biden participated in 20 phone calls with clients to be the brand. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1512.24s)]
*  So we go too far down the, uh, Biden, uh, uh, and Trump well, which will give us tons of, I think, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1516.8s)]
*  material. Maybe we can get to Ukraine, which a Ukraine war and, and, you know, who do you think's [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1526.32s)]
*  ultimately responsible for the invasion of Ukraine? Do you think the United States? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1533.36s)]
*  Obviously the governor has said he supports Ukraine and he believes that. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1536.96s)]
*  Yeah. So maybe just in terms of governor, do you think the United States is responsible for the [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1541.28s)]
*  invasion of Ukraine? Cause we didn't do enough in terms of taking NATO off the table, like some [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1548.4s)]
*  people think, or do you think Putin is responsible for invading Ukraine because he invaded Ukraine? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1552.96s)]
*  I don't want to leave the witness. You already did, but the, the, the, um, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1561.1200000000001s)]
*  the, my answer is that the Putin is responsible now. Shocking. I do think though that United States [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1566.88s)]
*  inaction, um, and, and bad signal sending to Putin going all the way back to George W. Bush, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1574.88s)]
*  who said, I looked into his eyes and saw his soul. Um, then to Barack Obama, who was, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1583.44s)]
*  you know, completely uninterested, um, in anything. And when Putin made moves on Ukraine [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1590.72s)]
*  under the Poot, under the Obama administration, he did nothing. Um, to Donald Trump, who saw it [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1598.0s)]
*  as an opportunity to extort Vladimir Zelensky, um, to get dirt on Joe Biden, um, in return for military [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1603.3600000000001s)]
*  aid to Joe Biden, who I think has been a hand wringer on this issue. And when he said, well, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1611.6s)]
*  maybe a small invasion wouldn't be so bad. Um, you know, it reminds me of, you know, something I said [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1617.76s)]
*  to folks on when I was a U S attorney, everybody's definition of the word small is different. Um, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1624.3999999999999s)]
*  and you can't assume what they mean is the same thing you mean. So I do think there were American [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1630.08s)]
*  actions and inactions which contributed to sending signals to Putin that maybe we wouldn't care. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1635.4399999999998s)]
*  If he did it. Um, but, um, that's a small sliver in my view of the responsibility. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1641.76s)]
*  The lion's share of the responsibility is in my view on Putin. Fair enough. Would you admit [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1647.6799999999998s)]
*  Ukraine into NATO? Well, I think that in the situation we're in now, David, um, they're going [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1653.28s)]
*  to be, it's almost a de facto point at this point. I don't, I think that given that we permitted Russia [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1660.0s)]
*  to do what they did, um, given that we're that they have now executed what they've executed in [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1667.12s)]
*  terms of their aggression against Ukraine and the NATO support, um, uh, from a military hardware [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1673.6799999999998s)]
*  and other persp- and intelligence perspective for Ukraine. I think it is now a foregone conclusion [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1680.9599999999998s)]
*  that Ukraine will be, will be admitted to NATO. And frankly, it's gotta be now, I think one of the [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1688.0s)]
*  penalties and one of the prices that Putin pays for his aggression. But when would you do that? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1692.88s)]
*  I mean, so Yen Stoltenberg at the Vilnius summit made it explicit that Ukraine's future is in NATO, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1698.0800000000002s)]
*  but it could not happen unless and until they win this war. Would you admit them sooner than that? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1703.68s)]
*  No. Okay. No, I would not. Because that would lead to World War III, obviously. Uh, that's what I'm [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1710.5600000000002s)]
*  attempting to avoid. Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. Would you have been willing to take NATO expansion [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1716.16s)]
*  off the table in 2021 in order to avoid a war? No, I think that was too late. If you were going [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1722.16s)]
*  to take NATO expansion off of the, off of the table, if you were going to do it, it would have [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1729.92s)]
*  been done much earlier because if you did it then that would essentially be giving into Putin's [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1734.88s)]
*  threat. Um, and I think that would have sent an even worse signal than some of the signals that I, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1740.72s)]
*  that I mentioned before. So no, I wouldn't have been willing to do it in 21 in order to avoid it [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1746.4s)]
*  because quite frankly, I don't believe that it would have avoided it. It just would have [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1752.0s)]
*  forestalled it. Do you believe that we made the correct decision? I mean, I know I'm going way [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1755.68s)]
*  back here, but in 2008 at the Bucharest summit, we declared our intention to bring Ukraine and [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1759.2s)]
*  Georgia for that matter into NATO, but we didn't have a plan to do it. Do you believe that was a [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1765.04s)]
*  mistake? I think it was a mistake not to, if you're going to do it, you should have a plan that lays [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1768.96s)]
*  out exactly how and when and why. And I think just, um, expressing aspirational goals in that [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1774.72s)]
*  regard is dangerous in foreign policy in that regard. And so I think the mistake was made [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1783.44s)]
*  not necessarily by ever having Ukraine and NATO, but by doing it the way it was done again, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1790.0s)]
*  wasn't, in my view, an unnecessary or at least not well thought out provocation. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1796.56s)]
*  Is there anything about Joe Biden's policy in Ukraine that you would change? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1803.2s)]
*  Yeah, it would have been much more aggressive in providing military hardware much sooner [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1808.08s)]
*  than what he did. And I think he's been, he's been the hand wringer on it. Every step has had, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1813.68s)]
*  has been preceded by fretting and burrowing frat, um, furrowing brows and, and, and, uh, hand [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1820.4s)]
*  wringing. And I think if you're going to be in this, you have to give them the tools they need [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1830.4s)]
*  to win. Um, when I met with Zelensky a month ago, he made it very clear to me, he had no interest [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1835.8400000000001s)]
*  in American or allied troops in Ukraine now or ever. He felt this was Ukraine's war to win or lose, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1844.16s)]
*  but that they needed the, uh, the, the military hardware necessary to, to compete [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1851.76s)]
*  in this war against Russia. And that, you know, my view of what their biggest concerns were, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1859.04s)]
*  which I, the ones that I agree with are the pace and amounts of armaments that have been given [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1865.12s)]
*  not only by the U S but by the rest of the NATO allies as well. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1871.52s)]
*  I mean, for a lot of us, let me just ask a quick couple of quick follow ups here and then we can [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1875.04s)]
*  move on. I mean, for a lot of us, Biden has not been half-hearted about this. He saw it $113 billion [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1879.04s)]
*  appropriation. That seems like a ton of money that could have been spent domestically. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1884.24s)]
*  What little hand wringing there was, was on the giving of F 16s and Abrams tanks. And the reason [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1888.32s)]
*  for that, Biden said, was that it could lead to war three. I mean, are you not concerned about [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1895.2s)]
*  those kinds of escalations? I mean, isn't that a good thing to be concerned about, not dismissive [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1900.72s)]
*  about? It's always, it's always important to be concerned about it, but you have to be thoughtful [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1904.48s)]
*  about it and look at what the, what the alternatives are. And to me, the alternative of allowing [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1909.68s)]
*  the combination of China and Russia to, to route Ukraine is something that's not in the U S vital [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1915.52s)]
*  interests and will lead to other problems as well with China going forward. And so these are, none [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1926.0s)]
*  of these are easy decisions, Dave, but what they are, are the ones that you want someone who is [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1934.16s)]
*  thoughtful and has some experience making them as president. And I don't think Biden checks either [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1941.1200000000001s)]
*  of those boxes sufficiently. And I think his conduct has shown that. And by the way, the same [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1947.3600000000001s)]
*  applies to Trump. What do you think the resolution is here? And if in, I don't know, 16 months, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1952.96s)]
*  your president or when you're president, how would you deal with this? If the war still raging [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1959.28s)]
*  here? Well, I think it depends on what disposition the war is in at that point. Jason, I think you [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1965.44s)]
*  have to evaluate how successful has Ukraine been in pushing back. They've made some success in the [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1971.84s)]
*  past couple of weeks in terms of breaking through some of the Soviet initial defensive lines. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1978.56s)]
*  I think we have to see exactly how successful they've been. But what I would say is that [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1984.4s)]
*  there's, there's no question that this is a, it is a conflict that we [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1991.04s)]
*  need to support and send a clear message messages that have not been, as I said earlier, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=1998.72s)]
*  since it all clearly to Putin that, you know, this is a guy who has openly discussed the reassembling [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2003.36s)]
*  of the Soviet Union. And I have no, no illusions about the fact that this former KG beer [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2009.28s)]
*  thinks that the Soviet Union were the good old days. And if he thought he could get away with [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2018.8799999999999s)]
*  assembling as much of it as he possibly could, he would. And I think that we have to send a very [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2023.36s)]
*  clear message on that to him and a very clear message on that to China regarding authoritarian [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2029.44s)]
*  expansionism. And this is where I think the, the Trump, DeSantis, Ramoswami foreign policies are so [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2035.2s)]
*  hopelessly ill informed and naive. The idea that we're going to go to Putin, who yesterday was [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2044.4s)]
*  sitting with Kim Jong-un and persuaded the better places to be with us, go away from your communist [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2052.4s)]
*  brothers in China and North Korea and come with us because it'll be a much better deal for you. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2059.12s)]
*  And that Donald Trump is going to do that in 24 hours or Vivek Ramoswami is going to do it by virtue [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2065.4399999999996s)]
*  of his winning personality. I mean, to me, he looks like the guy you wanted to stuff in the locker in [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2071.68s)]
*  the 11th grade. But I don't think that's the guy who's going to persuade Vladimir Putin to leave [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2077.04s)]
*  the communist Chinese and to, you know, come to, come to the America side. But Governor, you have [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2082.3999999999996s)]
*  to admit the war is not going well for the Ukrainians. I mean, this counteroffensive, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2089.68s)]
*  here's what we were promised. Remember just several months ago before the counteroffensive, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2093.68s)]
*  you have people like Petraeus and Ben Hodges saying that the counteroffensive would be like a blitz. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2098.16s)]
*  They would rapidly penetrate the Seravikin lines. They would march across the country to the Sea of [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2103.9199999999996s)]
*  Azov. They had cut off the land bridge to Crimea. All this would happen within weeks and it would be [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2108.64s)]
*  a significant Ukrainian victory. It has been almost a total failure. The Ukrainians have taken, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2114.0s)]
*  even the Washington Post and Politico, publications like that have said their [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2119.84s)]
*  losses have been staggering. The battlefield reports have been sobering. These are our top [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2123.76s)]
*  blob publications saying this. So we have been unsuccessful. Moreover, you say we should give [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2129.1200000000003s)]
*  them more weapons, but we've run out. We've run out of the key type of ammunition in this war, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2134.48s)]
*  which is artillery shells. That's why we're giving them cluster bombs. We got the cupboard is bare. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2138.96s)]
*  So I'm just wondering how exactly would you turn this around given that the Ukrainians are losing [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2143.52s)]
*  this war very badly? Well, first off, there was a lot in there. All right, let's go back to [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2150.64s)]
*  the predictions from Petraeus and others. You didn't hear me making those predictions [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2156.7200000000003s)]
*  because I think anybody who was briefed on the deficiency of armaments for Ukraine [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2160.64s)]
*  would not have said something like that unless it was wishful thinking. Secondly, I understand [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2169.36s)]
*  the reports regarding our own deficiencies in providing them with more armaments. We have, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2178.08s)]
*  I think, work to do with the rest of our allies in NATO in terms of they're providing more of the [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2184.88s)]
*  artillery and other armaments that are needed by the Ukrainians. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2192.72s)]
*  Even less than we do. I mean, look, this is going to have to be something that we're going to have [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2197.04s)]
*  to cobble together to get it done. And it also shows what I was saying earlier in regards to [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2202.16s)]
*  the budget question that this massive military buildup that Donald Trump says he did was baloney. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2209.6s)]
*  I think you have an interesting point there actually, which is to me, one of the biggest [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2217.12s)]
*  surprises of this war is that we spend 877 billion on the Pentagon and that we could run out of ammo. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2220.24s)]
*  So, I mean, without blaming Trump per se or Biden, I just think we're getting ripped off. I mean, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2227.04s)]
*  the military industrial complex is royally screwing the American taxpayer. How can we [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2232.48s)]
*  spend 877 billion dollars and not have ammo? Can you explain that to me? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2237.04s)]
*  Or have food insecurity for a lot of members of the military, not have paid leave, not have [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2241.84s)]
*  health care. The idea that you don't want to look at that budget is an enormous- [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2248.24s)]
*  That's not what I said. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2253.44s)]
*  That is what you said. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2254.56s)]
*  No, it is not. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2255.52s)]
*  What did you say? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2256.48s)]
*  It's not. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2257.12s)]
*  You said you wouldn't mention- [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2257.36s)]
*  No, no, I did not say that. What I said was that the Pentagon has to be made more efficient [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2258.4s)]
*  and more effective with what it spends, but not reduce what it spends. And that goes right to the [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2265.12s)]
*  point that David just made, which is you have to get answers as president to the questions [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2271.36s)]
*  of what are you spending 877 billion dollars on if we're running out of ammo and there's food [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2277.52s)]
*  insecurity and there's not paid leave. So what I was saying through the answer I gave you on the [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2284.16s)]
*  budget was I did not see that as a place to cut, but I did say very clearly that it's a place where [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2290.72s)]
*  we have to make the Pentagon more efficient and effective. And we need a secretary of defense [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2299.52s)]
*  and a president who want to demand answers to those questions first. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2305.12s)]
*  Are you not sympathetic to the idea that efficiency sometimes means spending less [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2309.68s)]
*  to get the same or more? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2314.3199999999997s)]
*  If that's the conclusion we come to after examining it, then I'm very sympathetic to that. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2315.8399999999997s)]
*  So then you are opening to cutting the defense budget. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2320.64s)]
*  I'm open. It is a secondary issue, the primary issue on defense. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2322.88s)]
*  No, I understand. I just want a clear answer so I understand where you're coming from. You [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2329.2799999999997s)]
*  want to look at the defense budget. You have an intuition that there's potentially [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2332.24s)]
*  extreme levels of waste. If you find that waste, will you just cut it or will you just reallocate [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2337.6800000000003s)]
*  it? Reallocate. Why? For the very reasons that David's just talking about. If we're running out [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2344.2400000000002s)]
*  of ammo, if our submarine capacity is not where it should be, which I believe it is not, if our [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2350.2400000000002s)]
*  ship capacity is not where I believe it should be, and it is not in my view, and if our [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2356.4s)]
*  modernization of our air force is not where it should be, which I believe it is not, then you [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2361.92s)]
*  reallocate that money. Okay, so there's a principle in capitalism called zero-based budgeting, which I [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2368.16s)]
*  actually like what you're saying, but just to kind of double-click on what that is. Zero-based [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2373.92s)]
*  budgeting starts with the principle that you just started, which is what are our priorities? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2378.2400000000002s)]
*  What do we want to accomplish? And then you go and systematically build up where the budget [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2382.48s)]
*  actually starts at zero dollars. Hey, Pentagon, you get zero, not 800 billion. What do we need [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2386.8s)]
*  to accomplish? Oh, we need bullets. Okay. We need armaments. Okay. We need to have food security for [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2391.6800000000003s)]
*  all of our armed servicemen and women. Absolutely. And then what happens if that number gets to 350 [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2397.52s)]
*  billion? Do you just cut half a billion or do you find ways to spend the other half a trillion [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2404.2400000000002s)]
*  dollars? Well, I'm glad you brought that up because that's what I did as governor. I was the first [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2407.84s)]
*  governor who did zero-based budgeting and I did it. I'm the first governor in New Jersey to do it. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2413.04s)]
*  And I did it because of the dire straits that we were in. I didn't think we could assume any longer [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2418.72s)]
*  anything in terms of our spending. So I absolutely would want to take that approach. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2426.32s)]
*  Now, I don't think you're going to go from 877 billion to 350 billion and say that we've met all [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2431.84s)]
*  of our defense needs and the needs of our fighting men and women with that number. But [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2440.08s)]
*  let's just leave the number blank for a minute. If I concluded that we could do everything we needed [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2447.7599999999998s)]
*  to do through the re-engineering of how we were spending in the Pentagon and that ultimately it [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2454.3199999999997s)]
*  would check the boxes I want to check in terms of some of the issues I just talked about. And it [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2462.64s)]
*  turned out to be less than 877 billion. Of course, I would look not to spend 877 billion, but that [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2468.08s)]
*  assumes a lot of things in there as you know. But the principle of zero-based budgeting from my [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2477.2s)]
*  perspective worked when I was governor, not only in terms of keeping our spending at an increase of [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2483.36s)]
*  2% a year annually for eight years, but it also educated me much more on the intricacies of the [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2491.36s)]
*  budget as the ultimate decision maker. And I think that was useful. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2499.6800000000003s)]
*  Michael O'Brien You were a very effective prosecutor and part of that is having a good [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2503.36s)]
*  intuition. So I'm just going to ask you, your intuition, how much waste do you think is in the [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2507.0400000000004s)]
*  military industrial complex and that 877 billion? Do you think there's 30 cents of waste? Do you [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2512.7200000000003s)]
*  think there's 40 cents of waste? Do you think there's five cents of waste? Or do you think [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2517.52s)]
*  there's like 70 cents of waste? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2520.72s)]
*  John O'Brien My intuition tells me that it is significant. I can't put a number on it. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2522.56s)]
*  Be irresponsible for me to put a number on it. But there's no doubt that when you see us spending [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2526.9599999999996s)]
*  877 billion, and we don't have 155 millimeter artillery shells, that there's waste. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2531.4399999999996s)]
*  Michael O'Brien Let's talk about governance and just like civil society and government for a [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2539.3599999999997s)]
*  second. But let's just finish on this military industrial complex. Why is it? How does it come [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2543.04s)]
*  to be that so much corruption and graft gets introduced into the military budget? Explain [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2549.36s)]
*  just how it happens? How does all of this waste end up happening? Where on the one hand, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2559.04s)]
*  you ask people, men and women, oftentimes poor, oftentimes minorities to come and serve and put [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2565.04s)]
*  their lives on the front lines. You don't even give them enough food. Somebody's clearly making [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2570.2400000000002s)]
*  money out of the 877 billion. Just explain how that waste comes to be and the influence peddling [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2575.28s)]
*  and the revolving door just so that the average person can understand it. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2582.8s)]
*  John O'Brien Well, first off, and I'll answer your question specifically, but let me say, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2586.0800000000004s)]
*  by answering it this way, I don't want to imply in any way that this waste and corruption happens [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2592.2400000000002s)]
*  just in the military budget. Because it happens. It's been my experience, it happens across [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2599.52s)]
*  budgets across disciplines. With that being said, I would say it happens in a number of ways. First [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2604.96s)]
*  of all, not doing zero based budgeting contributes to that because people no longer have to rationalize [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2611.84s)]
*  or justify the existence of a program. They just need to hire enough lobbyists to keep it getting [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2618.16s)]
*  put in there. So that's one way that it happens. Secondly, incompetence in administration. So people [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2623.28s)]
*  who are either purely incompetent in the job or alternative to is are corrupt in the job. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2631.44s)]
*  And so they look the other way on waste because they want to get a job through the revolving door [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2639.2000000000003s)]
*  you talked about on the other side. Third way that I think it happens is [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2645.28s)]
*  um, extraordinary events that cause political overreaction. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2652.6400000000003s)]
*  So you'll have an extraordinary event that occurs from a national security perspective. And then [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2660.8s)]
*  politicians want to look like we're responding to it. And the way we're responding to it is we're [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2668.32s)]
*  going to spend X tens, hundreds of billions more on this broad category of initiatives [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2673.6s)]
*  without really digging into whether that can be spent effectively that way or not. And then once [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2683.7599999999998s)]
*  it gets in there for the reasons I gave to you in the two examples before it doesn't get out. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2689.44s)]
*  So you layer it over and layer it over and layer it over and layer it over. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2696.16s)]
*  And then that's the way that stuff happens. So I think it's a bit of a nutshell presentation on [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2700.48s)]
*  that for you. But I think those are the three most important elements that I've observed personally [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2708.8s)]
*  in governing a state with 60,000 employees and a $34 billion budget. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2717.84s)]
*  You think the antidote to that is a is to start with zero based budgeting or there are other more [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2725.12s)]
*  radical changes you would want to make whether it's the CIA or the NSA? How do you think about [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2729.8399999999997s)]
*  getting to the root cause of or root answer of the truth? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2736.3199999999997s)]
*  Look, I think that that there's two ways to do it initially. And zero based budgeting is one of them. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2739.7599999999998s)]
*  And secondly, is to try to select competent people for those positions [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2746.56s)]
*  who understand clearly from the leader what their mission is. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2755.28s)]
*  Would you, for example, be willing to do an EO that said, if you serve in these roles, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2758.7200000000003s)]
*  you're banned from serving any of these folks for 20 years or something like that, something that [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2763.44s)]
*  just makes it clear that there's no financial motivation for somebody to walk out the door and [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2767.52s)]
*  then go and work for Lockheed Martin or just augment that. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2772.0s)]
*  Let's talk about these former generals like the ones we were quoting who predicted the [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2775.28s)]
*  counteroffensive would be this wonderful success. They're all now on the boards of weapons manufacturers. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2778.6400000000003s)]
*  So the people in the Pentagon who make a lot of these procurement decisions about weapons systems [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2785.1200000000003s)]
*  when they retire, they go off to serve on these boards. I mean, the big weapons companies are [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2791.28s)]
*  basically their retirement program. I mean, that seems like a horrible set of incentives. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2797.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, would you do something like ban the revolving door between [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2801.92s)]
*  people working in the Pentagon and then working for a weapons company? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2805.52s)]
*  Well, I certainly would be willing to consider if they worked with a particular contractor, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2809.76s)]
*  they had supervisory or decision making authority over a program run by a particular contractor, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2817.6s)]
*  not being able to go back out and work for that contractor. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2823.6s)]
*  When they go back in, the problem is they know in advance that their retirement program is going to [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2826.16s)]
*  be working on one of these boards. So they're not as tough as they should be when they're actually [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2830.08s)]
*  in the government job. So you're talking about the revolving door on the way in or the way out? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2834.48s)]
*  Basically, you work your way up to general and then you retire and then you join the boards of [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2839.44s)]
*  these Raytheon and Lockheed and all these guys. Well, I think that there are appropriate [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2842.96s)]
*  restrictions that can be put on in terms of number of years to make it go past the period [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2850.24s)]
*  when that person could have direct political influence on the administration that's in play. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2855.92s)]
*  But I also think we need to be careful about the fact that we don't wind up throwing out the baby [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2861.12s)]
*  with the bath water in the sense that there are some people who are legitimate people who are not [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2868.32s)]
*  looking to do it in a way that is corrupt or unethical, but who develop great expertise [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2876.16s)]
*  in certain areas. And that expertise can be very helpful. We're only looking at the negative side [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2882.56s)]
*  of it. So I think there are ways to do what we need to do with the political influence. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2887.2s)]
*  And that it would be to ban it for the rest of that administration. So if you serve in a particular [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2892.56s)]
*  administration, for the rest of that administration, you can't go back out and work on the issues that [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2898.32s)]
*  you were working on when you were there. That to me, this seems to be reasonable. I don't know [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2904.88s)]
*  whether 20 years makes sense or not. But we've identified the problem. Now let's figure out how [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2909.6s)]
*  to fix it. Mike, I'm willing and open to do that, but I want to make sure I do it in a way [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2917.2s)]
*  that is not creating a whole different set of problems that we'll then be talking about. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2924.0s)]
*  And the analogy I make in part on this is the wall between CIA and FBI [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2930.24s)]
*  and the problems that that I think precipitated regarding 9-11. So [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2935.92s)]
*  there are fixes to these things. And I'm telling you guys is I'm willing to be open about [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2944.16s)]
*  how to do it. I favor the concept. I think we're negotiating over length of years and how it applies. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2950.24s)]
*  Should that be the case for all government administrative jobs, Governor? Sure. So FDA [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2956.88s)]
*  into healthcare, healthcare into FDA, USDA? Should that be the case everywhere? [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2962.6400000000003s)]
*  It's the same principle. Yeah. How should that then be applied to Congress people? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2968.48s)]
*  Well, since the EO won't cover members of Congress in the same way that that's why they don't have [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2974.2400000000002s)]
*  term limits, which I believe they should have, and why none of this stuff will ever apply to Congress. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2980.0s)]
*  So let's tell the truth. It'll never apply to Congress because they'd have to pass it for it [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2985.6000000000004s)]
*  to apply and it will never happen. But the president could do what he could do about his [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2991.12s)]
*  branch of government and should, and I would. Let's pivot to one of the most controversial [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=2997.2s)]
*  topics between the two parties, which is immigration. And I'll pull up two charts here [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3002.16s)]
*  to queue up the discussion. Here's the first chart. Just since 2000, we've been net migration in the [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3006.96s)]
*  United States, just on a steady stream down at around 5 million. Second chart is border crossings [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3014.3199999999997s)]
*  that orange line there that you're seeing. That's COVID. And then the blue line obviously is the [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3021.2799999999997s)]
*  return from COVID. But the border agency seems to think not much has changed over the last couple [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3025.68s)]
*  of years at the border. However, we have, and that's across obviously multiple administrations. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3031.04s)]
*  Other countries have point-based systems. They have very logical discussions over immigration. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3038.0s)]
*  Is this person going to add and be accretive to the society? Is this person going to be a drain [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3044.3199999999997s)]
*  on society? And, you know, they just UK, Australia, New Zealand, countless countries now use this [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3048.96s)]
*  point-based system. It's incredibly polarized here. And we have the lowest, we have the lowest [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3055.36s)]
*  unemployment of our lifetime, plenty of jobs. We still have 1.6 jobs per American who is, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3061.04s)]
*  who are looking for jobs. I'm curious why you think this immigration discussion is so polarized [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3067.68s)]
*  and not factual and how you as president would resolve this issue and maybe make it make more [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3074.96s)]
*  sense to the American public. Well, look, I think the first thing, the first part of the question is [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3083.76s)]
*  how has it gotten so polarized? And I think it's because people in political life have used this [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3091.04s)]
*  as a weapon on both sides of the aisle to try to promote their own political agendas. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3097.28s)]
*  Democrats have wanted this perception on their positive side from their perspective [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3105.68s)]
*  that they'll let anybody in because they think ultimately those folks who come in will be their [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3112.8s)]
*  voters ultimately over the long haul. And they also want to raise restrictions. They want to [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3118.08s)]
*  raise the issue of restrictions that are placed by Republicans on this to make us seem to be [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3126.56s)]
*  heartless, uncaring, unfeeling people. On our side, we want to make the entire system seem [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3132.88s)]
*  completely lawless because that plays into our view of ourselves as the law and order party and [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3142.7999999999997s)]
*  the Democrats as the party who could give a damn about law and order. And we want to play into the [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3149.52s)]
*  populist side of it, which says that any person who comes over the border is likely to take your [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3156.3999999999996s)]
*  job, not just a job, your job. And then when you present it to people that way, they are course [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3161.6s)]
*  are going to be anti-immigration because they'd like to keep their job and support their family [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3169.36s)]
*  and have a life that they want to look forward to and for their kids as well. So [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3175.2000000000003s)]
*  that's my explanation on the first part as to how we got here. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3183.1200000000003s)]
*  Seems logical, yeah. And fair, by the way. Your assessment of both parties, by the way, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3186.32s)]
*  on these topics, I think is excellent. By the way, completely unfair way to have conducted [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3190.56s)]
*  this stuff. The problem has been that we haven't had presidential leadership on this issue since [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3196.16s)]
*  Reagan Reagan ultimately. And I think he learned this as a conservative governor in a blue state [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3202.56s)]
*  where you had to deal with Jesse Unruh running his legislature and Reagan was all front of [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3212.3999999999996s)]
*  mine because I just finished writing a book on Reagan. So it's fresh in mind to me. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3218.24s)]
*  Reagan learned that it was only he, the governor, who could force people into a room to get issues [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3222.56s)]
*  resolved in the same way when he was president, he didn't love the deal he made on immigration. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3233.84s)]
*  Same way he didn't love the deal he made on social security, but he liked it more than he [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3243.04s)]
*  liked it more than he liked the alternative of doing nothing. I think the only way we're going [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3250.08s)]
*  to resolve the immigration issue, Jason is to have a president, as I said in response to David [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3256.3999999999996s)]
*  Friedberg's earlier question on debt, a president who's willing to sacrifice [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3263.6s)]
*  some popularity to try to force a resolution. And I do think that most Americans [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3269.4399999999996s)]
*  would support a merit based immigration system. Why does it never come up? I mean, it's if these [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3276.24s)]
*  other countries have had such great success with it, why won't any politician say it? I haven't [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3281.7599999999998s)]
*  heard you say it in the debates. I don't know if you have, I haven't heard everything you've said, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3286.24s)]
*  but they didn't even ask us about immigration in the debates. They asked us that immigration, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3289.8399999999997s)]
*  entitlements, or the debt. Three things we've already talked about here today. Yeah, but they [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3293.52s)]
*  had time to ask me about UFOs. Yeah, that was pretty bizarre. They're like, Hey, let's give you [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3299.68s)]
*  the most meaningless question of anybody in the debate. That's what the base wants to hear. Come [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3306.1600000000003s)]
*  on. Yeah. I mean, wrap it up for us, uh, governor. Um, let's talk about UFOs. I mean, what did you [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3310.48s)]
*  think of the ending of secession governor? Yeah. I mean, you know, it's like, I, so, um, so I have [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3315.76s)]
*  talked about it at my town hall meetings about Republicans should be advocating for a merit based [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3322.5600000000004s)]
*  immigration system. But we need to also recognize, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3328.4s)]
*  while I think both parties will be in, should be in favor of a secure Southern border, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3334.0s)]
*  if for no other reason than the fentanyl and drug related issues that are, that are involved. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3341.76s)]
*  Why is there such a debate over the numbers? Cause you know, I, I just pulled up those numbers and [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3349.28s)]
*  that's the border patrol and that's across multiple administrations. And then people are saying [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3353.44s)]
*  simulation, Jason, do you see the Washington post just last week? The headline is families crossing [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3357.84s)]
*  us border illegally reached all time high in August. This is the Washington post. Oh, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3363.52s)]
*  you trust the Washington post now? I'm saying that if a liberal Democrat publication that serves the [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3369.6s)]
*  DC blob is admitting this problem, why can't you admit it? Oh, I'm not saying that it's not at all [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3375.44s)]
*  time highs, but it doesn't seem to have gotten much different than over the last two administrations. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3383.28s)]
*  You want to act like it's not a serious problem. No, no, I don't. I promise you. I'm not worried [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3388.88s)]
*  about my job. I brought it up. The United States can't absorb a million migrants. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3393.2000000000003s)]
*  It's my question. Obviously I care about it. So don't tell me I don't care about it. I'm just [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3400.0s)]
*  fact checking that that it's fine to fact check, but even though it's at all time highs, if you [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3404.0s)]
*  look at that chart, it seems like there's a big debate on the numbers that hey, maybe at all time [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3409.2s)]
*  highs, but it's been relatively the same. And so that's what I'm trying to get at. Governor, why [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3413.6s)]
*  can't we get good numbers on this? Well, we do get good numbers on it, but everybody slices the [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3419.6s)]
*  numbers differently. You know, I used to work in a deli when I was in high school for a period of time. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3425.2799999999997s)]
*  And, you know, everybody had the same big chunk of baloney, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3434.0s)]
*  but depending on how you sliced it, it looked different. And so I agree with David that it is [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3438.48s)]
*  a very serious problem right now. And it's because of Biden's policies and his rhetoric. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3447.44s)]
*  He sent a very clear signal during the 2020 campaign. If I win the borders open, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3456.4s)]
*  let's go. Everybody come on in. And it has caused a crisis in a number of levels. Also, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3462.72s)]
*  democratic politicians saying that they were willing to be sanctuary cities and sanctuary states. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3470.48s)]
*  Well, now I see the front page in New York Post every day. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3476.7999999999997s)]
*  And here's Eric Adams complaining. He needs help. He needs help. Well, you should have shut up [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3481.7599999999998s)]
*  and not said you were a sanctuary city. And then you wouldn't need to help. But it's easy. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3490.2400000000002s)]
*  Did you see the video yesterday? He said in all his time in New York, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3496.1600000000003s)]
*  he's always seen an end to every problem. There's always a solution. He says, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3500.1600000000003s)]
*  I have not seen, I cannot see an end to this problem. I don't see a solution. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3504.0s)]
*  Yeah. Governor, you just broke Jason's heart. You were his perfect candidate until that answer. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3508.4s)]
*  No, no, no. No, he didn't. I'm in favor of the point-based system. I have been very consistent [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3512.8s)]
*  about that. I think we should actually have a thoughtful discussion of how many people we can [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3518.08s)]
*  actually bring in and sustain. You know, that's the obvious discussion. We all agree on merit-based [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3522.3199999999997s)]
*  immigration. The thing that I have an issue with, Jason, is that you pretend like the border's [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3528.16s)]
*  not in crisis. It is in crisis. I think it hasn't been resolved for decades, right? I mean, we have [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3532.3199999999997s)]
*  not had a solution there. When's the last time the border was functional? Well, Trump at least had [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3541.52s)]
*  a remain in Mexico policy and then Biden revoked it. And now they're thinking about bringing it [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3545.6s)]
*  back because they have no way to control the huge number of people who are streaming across. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3549.6s)]
*  Yeah. I'm just trying to advocate for a point-based system. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3553.44s)]
*  By the way, on the numbers, that's what should be part of a negotiation [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3555.7599999999998s)]
*  between Republicans and Democrats in Congress and the White House. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3561.04s)]
*  Yeah. Based upon the current circumstances. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3564.72s)]
*  We can't deal with all the stuff that's happened before, but what we know now is we have current [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3569.04s)]
*  circumstances now, guys, which are not only impacting quality of life in terms of crime [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3574.0s)]
*  and quality of life in terms of education, because you see what's going to happen in [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3582.08s)]
*  the New York school system. And, you know, you are going to have thousands of immigrant children [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3587.44s)]
*  who now are going to show up at the New York City public schools to be educated. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3596.0s)]
*  That's why the uncontrolled part of what David Sachs is talking about is so vital right now. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3600.56s)]
*  And thirdly, but most importantly to me, is the fentanyl issue. Because when you have 110,000 [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3610.4s)]
*  people dying of overdoses last year in this country, and you have overdose being the number [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3617.28s)]
*  one killer of men between 18 and 34, it is a crisis. And it is a crisis, which is not creating [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3621.2s)]
*  entirely by the border, but is contributed to mightily by what's going on at the border. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3628.96s)]
*  Would you send, there's been talk of this, I think, from certain candidates, would you send troops [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3634.56s)]
*  into Mexico to take out the cartels? Or is that? [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3640.08s)]
*  No, I would not. I would put National Guard at the border to work with Customs and Border Patrol [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3644.32s)]
*  to stop the fentanyl cartels from getting into our country. And I would use our intelligence community [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3651.2s)]
*  to do what we always do with enemies of that nature, which is to target them and to make sure [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3662.96s)]
*  that if they're going to do what they're going to do, that they're dealt with. But in terms of a [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3669.2s)]
*  Ron DeSantis full-scale invasion of Mexico, yeah, I think I'd probably demur on that one. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3674.48s)]
*  You'd whack these people bringing the fentanyl in, you just wouldn't do it on the soil in Mexico. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3680.24s)]
*  Correct. And also, and I'd whack them within the laws of the United States. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3685.04s)]
*  It would not be a vigilante system where everybody goes down there and just starts popping somebody [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3692.3199999999997s)]
*  they think is a fentanyl dealer as they come over the border. But what I would also say to you is, [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3697.4399999999996s)]
*  we've got to also make sure we deal with this diplomatically with the Mexicans. And by [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3702.88s)]
*  diplomatically, I mean, not like be nice through very hard negotiations with them to say to the [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3710.96s)]
*  Mexican president, like you are importing precursor chemicals from China into your country to make [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3717.12s)]
*  fentanyl with the sole purpose of profiting from and killing Americans. That's not something we're [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3726.0s)]
*  going to tolerate. So you wouldn't send furio. We got it. We do it the smart way, not the way that [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3733.2s)]
*  lets you pound your chest and pretend you're a television tough guy. Let me double click on [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3740.48s)]
*  that since you brought up fentanyl. We have this crisis here in San Francisco, open air drug market, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3745.36s)]
*  cheapest fentanyl you can get. Plus we give subsidies if you come here and you're a fentanyl [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3750.08s)]
*  addict, we pay for you to come here. Essentially, it's absolute chaos. We keep getting promises in [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3754.0s)]
*  San Francisco that we're going to turn it around and we're going to take it seriously. It never [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3759.6s)]
*  happens. Given that, is there not a case for the feds coming in and cracking down on the fentanyl [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3762.8s)]
*  trade here? And if you were president, would you come in and you start the local authorities and [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3769.84s)]
*  just take out all these crazy open air drug markets in some cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco? [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3774.8s)]
*  I actually said that in the debate. What I would do would be to instruct the attorney general, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3781.12s)]
*  to instruct the US attorneys in the cities with these kinds of problems, that we are taking over [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3788.48s)]
*  the prosecution of violent and drug crime in those cities. If the prosecutors on the state level are [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3794.48s)]
*  unwilling to do it, the US attorneys have the laws on the federal books to do it. We have the [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3800.96s)]
*  rooms of the federal prisons and we will police these cities until they get their act together. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3806.4s)]
*  You just got a couple million votes in California because people here are fed up with the locals. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3812.4s)]
*  Governor, can I just push back on that? I recently started reading the federalist papers again, [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3816.32s)]
*  Sachs, I don't know when you last reviewed them. And I'm just struck by how so much of our modern [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3821.76s)]
*  political rhetoric is driven by what the federal government will do for you on a national basis, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3827.36s)]
*  a state basis, and now even a local basis. Is that really the role of the federal government? [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3832.48s)]
*  No. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3837.68s)]
*  Or should each state and each city ultimately decide what the hell kind of city they want to build, [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3837.84s)]
*  what they want to live in, and then deal with the consequences and let the federal government become [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3842.8s)]
*  responsible for the things that were defined in our constitution and that the constitutional republic [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3847.52s)]
*  was meant to set out to do for the federal government, rather than use the federal [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3853.12s)]
*  government as a hammer to smash all nails everywhere. At some point, the hammer is going to break. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3856.56s)]
*  So let me answer the question, which is no, it's not the role of the federal government to do it. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3863.36s)]
*  Unless the discord and the inability of the states to deal with an issue begins to affect [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3868.4s)]
*  the entire country. And I believe that these, this failure, and by the way, it's a planned failure, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3877.44s)]
*  David. This is the Soros group going around and electing these completely liberal prosecutors [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3885.12s)]
*  who say, no, I don't, I'm not going to prosecute these crimes anymore. It begins to affect the [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3893.2799999999997s)]
*  very nature of the entire country. If we don't have functional cities, David, we can't have a [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3899.68s)]
*  functional country. And so, no, I would do this only because I think by the time I get there in [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3904.88s)]
*  January of 25, we are going to be at last resort world. Now, if in the interim between now and [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3911.68s)]
*  January of 25, the discord in places like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, and [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3919.12s)]
*  others got so bad that the citizens there rose up and demanded something different. And the states [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3926.72s)]
*  and cities started to respond to it. I have no interest in doing this unless we are the law [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3933.9199999999996s)]
*  enforcers of last resort. And so philosophically, I completely agree with you, but we're now in a [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3940.08s)]
*  situation where when I was in New York City all day yesterday, it is the worst I've seen New York [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3947.12s)]
*  City since the late seventies. I agree. Yeah. And I was old enough then to go in. I was a high school [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3956.08s)]
*  student in the late seventies and go into the city. And my parents used to be petrified if I [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3962.7999999999997s)]
*  insisted on going into New York to go to a basketball game or a hockey game. The walk from [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3968.08s)]
*  the Port Authority bus terminal on 41st and 8th to Madison Square Garden on 33rd and 8th was an [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3972.72s)]
*  absolute youthful education on drugs and porn and violent crime. So I agree with you philosophically [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3980.0s)]
*  on that, but I think in the instance we're in right now, this is what we'd have to do in order to get [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3990.96s)]
*  it back under control. And so I'm not thrilled about it, but I think it's absolutely necessary. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=3997.28s)]
*  In the United States, we have somewhere between two and three million Americans incarcerated, [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4003.1200000000003s)]
*  one of the highest per capita incarceration rates of any country in the world. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4009.28s)]
*  And a lot of this justice reform movement arose from what are considered to be very deep inequities [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4013.76s)]
*  in the imprisonment of American citizens for various petty crimes, misdemeanors that turn [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4021.52s)]
*  into felonies, that turn into three strikes, that turn into spending your life in prison, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4029.28s)]
*  and that obviously there's a big racial divide in how this affects the population. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4033.6800000000003s)]
*  And from that movement arose this effort to try and address the social inequities [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4037.76s)]
*  and how the prison system has become to some an extension or the follow on to America's [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4042.2400000000002s)]
*  torrid history with slavery. What is your point of view then? Do we have inequities in [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4048.64s)]
*  the prison system, in how we address crime in this country? And if so, what would the right path have [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4055.92s)]
*  been looking back now at the efforts and the dollars that have gone into trying to solve this [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4061.3599999999997s)]
*  problem through decriminalization that has obviously led to massive problems in inner cities? [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4064.96s)]
*  Is it a problem, the criminalization in this country, the incarceration in this country? [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4070.72s)]
*  And if so, what's the right path to addressing it? And obviously you have an intimate history [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4074.3199999999997s)]
*  here, so you would know this better than most that we would talk to. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4078.48s)]
*  Look, I think it is a problem. And let me tell you what I did as governor. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4080.96s)]
*  We did criminal justice reform in New Jersey, and we did it in a bipartisan way. And this is what we [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4084.8s)]
*  did. I thought that the biggest problem we had in New Jersey was our state constitution required, [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4090.48s)]
*  it was a shall issue state on bail. Everyone was entitled to bail under our constitution. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4100.64s)]
*  And the only factor that could be taken into account constitutionally, David, was risk of [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4108.48s)]
*  flight. So if you had a rap sheet as long as my arm and your arm put together, that could not be [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4115.839999999999s)]
*  considered by a judge in whether or not to grant bail or not, nor could the nature of the violence [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4122.32s)]
*  you committed in those acts. I saw that as an enormous problem. I agreed with Democrats that [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4128.719999999999s)]
*  on a lot of these minor drug crimes, and I don't mean dealing crimes, I mean possession crimes, [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4136.4s)]
*  with addicts being arrested for small amounts of possession, that we had become a debtor's [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4142.4s)]
*  prison in New Jersey, that if somebody couldn't afford the 500 bucks for the minimum bail, which [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4149.28s)]
*  was usually $5,000, they spent more time in county and state prison than they ever would have spent [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4156.719999999999s)]
*  if they just pled guilty and been allowed to plead guilty and get sentenced. So the deal we [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4164.0s)]
*  made was this. On certain defined nonviolent crimes, I would agree to the state law allowing [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4170.56s)]
*  release on people's own recognizance. In return, the Democrats would amend our constitution [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4179.84s)]
*  to make it a May issue state on bail and to add dangerousness to the community as a factor to be [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4189.36s)]
*  considered in granting bail or not. What's happened since then? Crime in New Jersey is down. Since we [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4196.24s)]
*  did this, we closed two state prisons and we have not had any spike in violent crime like you've [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4203.12s)]
*  seen in New York since then, because we did it smartly and in a way that was balanced. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4211.919999999999s)]
*  And what you've also seen is 98% of the people released on their own recognizance have shown [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4219.12s)]
*  back up for their court hearings. So we're not having some people running around and jumping [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4226.24s)]
*  the ROR release that they've gotten. And I took one of the two state prisons we closed [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4232.16s)]
*  and turned it into a drug treatment prison so that folks who had documented drug and alcohol [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4239.759999999999s)]
*  addictions while in prison were able to go for the concluding parts of their term [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4247.4400000000005s)]
*  to this secondary prison to get, which is fully secure, and they were detained, but they also got [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4254.56s)]
*  drug and alcohol treatment while they were in there. And what we've seen with that is we've [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4261.92s)]
*  seen recidivism drop among those people who've gone through that program by nearly 40%. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4267.6s)]
*  There are ways we can do this without having the results New York has had through their ridiculous [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4272.64s)]
*  criminal justice reform. We can do it the right way across the whole country. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4280.56s)]
*  Have you seen other states follow New Jersey's leader or New Jersey's model? [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4286.08s)]
*  I have seen a couple of other states that have done it. I don't think anybody's done it as well [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4290.320000000001s)]
*  as we did it. And imagine this, you know, a Republican governor [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4294.72s)]
*  got support from the PBA and the FOB for that reform. So from law enforcement professionals [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4302.240000000001s)]
*  and got an A plus from the ACLU. Now, when you can get both of those, [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4311.4400000000005s)]
*  it's kind of hard to get that done. And I think we've gotten it done. And we just had a, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4318.400000000001s)]
*  at my policy institute, we just had a seminar on this from people from the public defenders [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4323.76s)]
*  to criminal, private criminal defense lawyers, prosecutors, and cops all on a panel. And not [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4330.0s)]
*  one of them had an objection to criminal justice reform in New Jersey. And this is now nearly 10 [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4336.8s)]
*  years after we did it. So I think there are ways to do this. Unfortunately, a lot of people [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4343.12s)]
*  don't want to have a long form conversation on criminal justice reform. They want to have [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4350.16s)]
*  either the Joe Biden approach from when he was in the Senate, mandatory minimums for everybody, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4358.16s)]
*  throw everybody in the can, three strikes, you're out, all that stuff. Or they want to have the [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4363.12s)]
*  George Soros conversation, you know, where nobody who commits a crime really meant to do it. And [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4367.839999999999s)]
*  all jail is unfair. Both of those are dead wrong. Governor, you mentioned the FBI briefly before. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4375.36s)]
*  One of the revelations that came out during the Twitter files is that we had 80 FBI agents [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4382.0s)]
*  monitoring Americans' social media accounts and submitting takedown requests to Twitter. This is [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4387.28s)]
*  your pre-Elon Twitter and presumably many other big tech companies, because I'm sure they weren't [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4394.88s)]
*  just doing this with Twitter. What business is it of the FBI to be monitoring and censoring Americans? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4400.08s)]
*  Do you think there's any justification for that? What is your view of that? [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4407.12s)]
*  Governor Bill Johnson I think the only reason to monitor those kind of things would be for [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4410.4s)]
*  terrorist information. And I think that would be reasonable to do. But I don't think for any other [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4415.36s)]
*  reason other than terrorist activity, domestic or foreign, I think the FBI has a right to do that. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4422.24s)]
*  And I think it's the right thing to do. But I don't think under any other circumstances, [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4431.04s)]
*  David, they should be doing that. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4436.32s)]
*  Pete Slauson Are you willing to say to Chris Ray, as I understand it, you recommended Chris Ray [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4437.36s)]
*  for the position many years ago. And I think you're a fan of his. Are you willing to say to him, [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4442.16s)]
*  knock this off? You should not be involved in censoring American social media accounts. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4448.4s)]
*  Governor Bill Johnson I'm willing to say to Chris exactly what I just said to you. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4454.4s)]
*  And by the way, I've known Chris long enough. I mean, we were in the Bush Justice Department [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4457.92s)]
*  together starting back at night, right post 9-11 period. So, I've known Chris now for 22 years. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4463.759999999999s)]
*  I will say exactly what I think to Chris and will instruct him appropriately with the attorney [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4471.679999999999s)]
*  general. And let me just make a point, David, since you brought that up. I don't think presidents [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4477.12s)]
*  should be involved in the criminal investigatory activity of the Department of Justice in any way. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4481.36s)]
*  And so, you should set policies that say like that, you know, your work should be restricted [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4490.4s)]
*  on monitoring just domestic or international terrorism. But you shouldn't be commenting [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4497.92s)]
*  in any way on what they're doing from a criminal investigatory perspective. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4505.360000000001s)]
*  I think that started in the Obama years with Eric Holder when you appoint your wingman attorney [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4510.56s)]
*  general. I guess that's what happens. And the fact is that it's continued through the Trump years and [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4516.24s)]
*  now through the Biden years. And my instruction to my attorney general will be the same as it was [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4522.320000000001s)]
*  because in New Jersey, we don't elect attorney general, we appoint them like you do in the [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4527.04s)]
*  federal system. And what I said to each of my attorneys general was, I know I was the U.S. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4531.04s)]
*  attorney for seven years. I got expertise and opinions on criminal prosecution. I'm never going [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4535.92s)]
*  to call you ever. And I never did. Because once you decide to be a political figure and not a law [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4541.68s)]
*  enforcement figure, you should stay out of criminal investigations. So, I know you didn't ask it, [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4548.56s)]
*  but it struck me when you were talking about that. So, let me ask you one last question from my end, [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4554.16s)]
*  which is, why are you running for president? Recent polling data show the 52% unfavorable [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4559.52s)]
*  rating, 23% favorable, and you're a three and a half percent in the average of the national polls. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4564.320000000001s)]
*  What's the goal here? Help us understand how you think about the campaign and how you think [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4569.92s)]
*  about your future as a political operator and what your goal is with the campaign. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4574.320000000001s)]
*  My goal is to be president of the United States. And since I've been doing this for a while, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4581.040000000001s)]
*  I don't pay attention to national polls because we don't have a national primary. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4585.44s)]
*  And in fact, we don't have a national general election. What we have is 50 individual state [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4589.839999999999s)]
*  elections. That's the way we nominate candidates. And if you look at the most recent poll in New [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4594.5599999999995s)]
*  Hampshire, I'm in second place in New Hampshire at 14% ahead of Ron DeSantis, ahead of Vivek, [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4599.28s)]
*  ahead of Nikki, ahead of Pence, and behind only Trump. And now I'm behind by 20 points. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4605.919999999999s)]
*  I'll give you that. But I'm behind a guy who's only at 34% in that poll. And so I absolutely [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4612.4s)]
*  believe I can win New Hampshire. And I believe if I win New Hampshire, David, then the whole race [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4620.5599999999995s)]
*  changes. You have a line there. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So, so let's start off with I'm running because I [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4626.32s)]
*  want to be president of the United States. Yeah. And that's the only reason to run. I think I don't [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4631.599999999999s)]
*  need to run to become famous. I'm famous enough. I don't need to run. I don't need to run to get a [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4636.64s)]
*  book deal. Because you know what, I've already written two books and my third one's getting [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4643.92s)]
*  ready to come out. I don't need it to get a job on TV. I gave that up to run for president. So I'm [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4648.400000000001s)]
*  running for president to be president, David. And and that's why I'm doing it. And for no other [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4654.56s)]
*  reason. Should Donald Trump be in jail? We'll find out when these trials happen. What do you think? [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4660.160000000001s)]
*  I'm willing to give everybody the presumption of innocence, because that's what the Constitution [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4666.64s)]
*  demands that I do. Do I think what's your prosecutorial intuition? I would have indicted [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4670.0s)]
*  both federal cases. I would not have indicted the New York case or the Atlanta case as to Donald [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4677.04s)]
*  Trump. I think on the New York case, the Manhattan DA has much more important work to be doing [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4683.12s)]
*  than bringing a case on a seven year old payment to a porn star that he was having an affair with [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4688.400000000001s)]
*  to keep it from the American people after the American people already know everything they need [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4694.32s)]
*  to know about it. So I think that was useless and purely political. In the Atlanta case, once Jack [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4698.4s)]
*  Smith indicted Trump on election interference federally, I know that Fannie Willis was probably [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4704.32s)]
*  very upset that she had been investigating it for two and a half years and he beat her to the punch. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4712.08s)]
*  But he beat her to the punch. And there's no reason to indict somebody for the same acts twice. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4717.28s)]
*  And so I wouldn't have indicted him in Atlanta. I would have indicted him for sure on the [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4723.68s)]
*  documents case. But I will tell you since you asked, I wouldn't have indicted him on the [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4730.72s)]
*  documents. I would have just indicted him on the obstruction of justice and the lying. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4735.4400000000005s)]
*  I think by indicting on the documents, you just made it a much more complicated case [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4741.360000000001s)]
*  that may not get to trial for a year and a half or two because of the classified documents involved. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4745.280000000001s)]
*  And I would have invited him on the January 6th case because I believe his activity [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4750.72s)]
*  from election night forward is worthy of the probable cause standard. Now we'll see [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4756.16s)]
*  if the government can prove it beyond a reasonable doubt on both those cases. I will tell you. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4764.639999999999s)]
*  But on those cases that you would bring, that you would indict as a prosecutor, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4770.639999999999s)]
*  what sentence would you seek? Because these Democrat prosecutors are seeking [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4774.4s)]
*  over 500 years of jail time for Trump. I mean, what do you think the appropriate punishment is? [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4779.36s)]
*  David, that's just the statutory number. It's not whatever is done. And people do that all the time. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4785.2s)]
*  They look at the statutory maximum. They add up each count in the statutory maximum and they come [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4790.799999999999s)]
*  to 500. It never happens. And it's never asked for. And it's never asked for. What you do is you look- [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4795.599999999999s)]
*  If you were the prosecutor, what punishment would you be seeking? [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4801.759999999999s)]
*  I don't think that it makes any sense for Donald Trump to go to jail. And it's not just because [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4804.88s)]
*  he's Donald Trump. It has more to do, quite frankly, with the fact that he'd probably be 79 [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4812.72s)]
*  years old before he'd be ready to go to jail. And when I was prosecuting cases, I really felt like [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4818.88s)]
*  when you get to that age and you send someone into the atmosphere that federal prison is, [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4825.36s)]
*  even the minimum security federal prison, that you're essentially giving them a death sentence. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4830.400000000001s)]
*  And unless they've done something, like Bernie Madoff, for instance, which is worthy of a death [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4835.52s)]
*  sentence, then I would not think that sending him to jail would be appropriate. Now, a judge may feel [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4841.28s)]
*  differently. And in the end, all the prosecutor does is make a recommendation. The judge makes [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4851.52s)]
*  a decision. If I were president of the United States, well, I would not consider pardoning [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4856.8s)]
*  Donald Trump if he were convicted, unless the trial for some reason showed itself to have [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4862.24s)]
*  unconstitutionally unfair elements that were not corrected by the courts. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4868.639999999999s)]
*  Other than that, I wouldn't pardon him. But if he were sentenced to jail, I certainly would [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4874.16s)]
*  consider commuting the sentence for the reasons I just said. Let's talk about what happened on [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4879.12s)]
*  January 6th for a second. A lot of folks in the Republican Party are framing it as like a day out [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4883.679999999999s)]
*  at the park. And we just saw Trump appointed judges give the oath keepers and the Proud Boys [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4889.36s)]
*  sentences, multi-decade sentences for seditious conspiracy. Do you think these sentences [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4897.44s)]
*  that have been handed down by Trump appointed judges are part of a deep state conspiracy [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4904.5599999999995s)]
*  against the Republicans? Or do you think these people are domestic terrorists and that they [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4909.759999999999s)]
*  got appropriate sentences? You know, I don't want to Jason give an answer on each one of the cases [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4914.16s)]
*  because I quite frankly, could tell you that I haven't followed the cases each one of them [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4920.0s)]
*  closely enough. You just did on the other four. Let's give an opinion. Pardon me. You just did [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4924.32s)]
*  on the other four, though. No, there were no you're asking me about that was the Trump cases. Yeah. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4928.16s)]
*  So now I'm talking about and I said that because of his age. Okay. All right. And so [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4937.04s)]
*  none of these folks on the Proud Boys, I think we're in their 70s. Okay. So that's the difference [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4943.44s)]
*  between the two. But I'm going to try to answer your question. Great. I just don't want to say [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4949.04s)]
*  I'm giving an opinion as to each and every sentence. Okay. What I want to say about it, [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4952.719999999999s)]
*  though, is that what they did on January 6th was unlawful. It was extremely serious. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4958.16s)]
*  And it requires imprisonment. Okay. And so each of these individual cases have nuances and [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4966.72s)]
*  individual facts to them that I'm not I will tell you I'm not completely conversant in. Okay. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4973.68s)]
*  So the difference between a 15 year sentence and an 18 year sentence or 22 year sentence. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4979.6s)]
*  If I sat down and I delved into what was presented at trial, and what was presented in the [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4985.12s)]
*  sentencing memoranda, I'd give you an opinion, but I haven't done that, to be honest. Can I ask? [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4990.5599999999995s)]
*  Can I ask one final question? From my perspective, one of the reasons that [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=4995.52s)]
*  the polling can sometimes veer this way is that in the Republican polls, a lot of the attacks against [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5002.160000000001s)]
*  you, Governor focus on obviously, bridgegate and beachgate, and then this kind of like [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5008.64s)]
*  theoretical corruption allegations directed at you and your staff. Now, your staff was convicted of [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5017.200000000001s)]
*  wire fraud, but then the Supreme Court overturned it nine to zero. Right. And now what they said, [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5022.96s)]
*  though, was that there was corruption, but there wasn't corruption to try to get money, which is [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5028.56s)]
*  why the wire fraud I think that's what Elena Kagan said in the ruling the majority ruling it was and [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5033.12s)]
*  it was nine oh, so it was very, very clear that the DOJ just kind of took again to your case talking [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5037.2s)]
*  about Trump, the wrong charges almost okay, and what they did was not illegal, even if what they [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5043.76s)]
*  did may have been illegal under a different statute. In any event, it would be great for you [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5048.5599999999995s)]
*  to set the record on bridgegate and beachgate. We're really calling beachgate. Well, I'm just [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5053.44s)]
*  calling it what the press like really, well, I think what people got upset was, and I'm just [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5060.16s)]
*  going to repeat this, I don't have an issue with this is there was a state beach that was closed, [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5064.32s)]
*  and there was pictures of you and your family on that beach when everybody else was told to stay at [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5068.32s)]
*  home. That's, I guess that's what people point to. I'm just giving you that just say, just address [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5072.16s)]
*  it however you want. So you can be definitive in your own language. All right. So let's deal with [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5077.2s)]
*  the beach situation. Every beach in New Jersey, that day was open, except for one. Every beach in [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5083.04s)]
*  New Jersey. So the idea that people across the state of New Jersey were kept off the beach that [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5093.28s)]
*  day. And me and my family were the only people on the beach is completely wrong. So everybody who [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5099.04s)]
*  wanted to go to the beach that day could go to the beach somewhere in New Jersey, except for the [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5107.76s)]
*  state park. And the reason the state park was closed was because the legislature did not send [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5112.64s)]
*  me a budget in time. If they'd sent me a budget, I would have signed it and the beach would have [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5118.24s)]
*  been open. They refused to send me a budget. Now, having said that factually contextually, [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5123.36s)]
*  it was a mistake for me to go on the beach. Now I told everybody when the budget standoff was going [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5130.08s)]
*  on, that my family was going to be at that house and they were going to go on the beach, [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5137.2s)]
*  but we were not going to use any services, lifeguards or garbage service or anything else, [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5144.639999999999s)]
*  because it wouldn't be open. So I told everybody that up front, [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5150.0s)]
*  I shouldn't have gone out there myself because I was the governor. It was a mistake. I went out [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5155.36s)]
*  there and spent an hour with my family. It was a mistake. I hardly think it merits a gate. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5161.04s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't give it a gate. A kerflafl maybe. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5167.92s)]
*  And I would hardly call it corruption. Okay. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5170.64s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's not corrupt. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5173.6s)]
*  On bridge gate. Let's remember this has been investigated by a democratic state legislature [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5174.8s)]
*  with subpoena power by a democratic US attorney with an axe to grind for me with subpoena power. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5183.4400000000005s)]
*  And in both of those investigations and also an investigation that we authorized internally, [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5193.68s)]
*  all three of the investigations agreed on one thing. I had no knowledge of what happened. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5202.56s)]
*  No one told me what was going on and I didn't find out about it until well after the fact. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5207.76s)]
*  And nobody's ever disputed that who's done an investigation. And if they thought I'd done [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5214.64s)]
*  something wrong, given the ridiculous indictments they brought, I'm sure they would have thrown me [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5219.84s)]
*  in there too. If they had anything they could have gone with. These were three employees [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5224.8s)]
*  who did something extraordinarily stupid. And they should have been fired and they were. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5230.16s)]
*  As soon as I found out about it, they were all fired. They should never work in public office [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5238.24s)]
*  again. But what they did was stupid, not criminal. And if we start criminalizing every time someone [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5243.6s)]
*  does something stupid, we won't have enough jails. And when you get Ruth Bader Ginsburg [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5251.04s)]
*  and Clarence Thomas to agree on an overreach by the Department of Justice, it was a politically [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5257.36s)]
*  motivated prosecution because I had just been reelected with 61% of the vote in a blue state [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5265.36s)]
*  and was ahead of Hillary Clinton by eight points in national polls. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5272.08s)]
*  That's why they did it. They thought they were going to get me. They cooperated the guy who [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5276.0s)]
*  admits he was the mastermind of the situation. They cooperated him to try to get me. And once [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5281.6s)]
*  they realized they couldn't get me, they had to indict somebody. So they indicted the two other [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5289.200000000001s)]
*  people. I believe you. I think that the DOJ engages in a lot of political prosecutions. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5293.68s)]
*  Why isn't Jack Smith's prosecution politically minded? And the point I'll come back to [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5299.84s)]
*  is that Merrick Garland did this analysis when he first came in on whether Trump was guilty of [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5304.4800000000005s)]
*  incitement on January 6th. And they had a memo come back saying, sorry, we can't get him for that. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5310.64s)]
*  There was then a leak in the Washington Post from Biden himself saying that he thought Merrick Garland [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5315.76s)]
*  was being kind of wimpy and that they should go after Trump. And then lo and behold, Merrick Garland [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5321.4400000000005s)]
*  appoints Jack Smith to go get Trump. And Jack Smith's case depends on knowing the inner workings [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5326.64s)]
*  of Trump's mind, this fraud on the American people idea that he not only made up this stolen [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5331.76s)]
*  election narrative, but he knew it was false, which I don't see how they're ever going to [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5337.52s)]
*  prove beyond a reasonable doubt. So why isn't that a political prosecution? I mean, Biden clearly [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5341.040000000001s)]
*  wanted it. He instigated it through a leak to the Washington Post, or at least that seems to be the [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5346.080000000001s)]
*  chronology, whether it was deliberate or not. And it requires Jack Smith to prove this impossible [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5351.76s)]
*  theory because it requires knowing what Trump was really thinking when he was saying all this stuff. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5357.4400000000005s)]
*  So how is that not an equally political prosecution? [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5362.320000000001s)]
*  All right, so let me separate the two. So you're talking just about Jan 6th, [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5365.2s)]
*  not about the classified documents. Correct. I'm just talking about the Jack Smith theory [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5370.08s)]
*  that Trump perpetrated a fraud because he knew his stolen election narrative was false. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5374.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, look, I think that there is going to be a lot of interesting testimony [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5380.24s)]
*  that will be given in that case regarding what Donald Trump really knew and what he really [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5384.48s)]
*  thought, what he was telling people at the time. And I don't think it's as clear cut as you're [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5389.92s)]
*  making it out to be. Now, what I said at the time when he brought the Jan 6th case is it is [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5394.4s)]
*  aggressive. There's no question it's an aggressive prosecution. Do I believe it's political? I don't [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5400.4s)]
*  know. But I will say it's aggressive. It's much more aggressive than the classified documents case [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5407.92s)]
*  because you're exactly right that state of mind, which is a part of every criminal case, [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5414.4s)]
*  will be a part of this one. And trying to get inside Donald Trump's mind is a dangerous thing [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5420.96s)]
*  because he says so many contradictory things. Right? So he was saying to me during debate prep [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5426.16s)]
*  in 2020 that he was absolutely convinced that he could lose this election. Not that it would be [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5434.0s)]
*  stolen, that he could lose it because of COVID and COVID ruined his great economy and now he's going [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5441.92s)]
*  to lose. So he said a lot of different things to a lot of different people over time. And all I'd [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5449.12s)]
*  say, David, is that it is going to be an aggressive case to prove. And by the way, if they don't prove [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5455.5199999999995s)]
*  it, it will be a stain on the Department of Justice for bringing the case at all. I have to believe. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5462.88s)]
*  So then why support it? I mean, look, so hold on. Let me agree with you. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5469.76s)]
*  I'm going to finish that. I know what you're going to say. So I'll finish it. I believe given what I [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5472.88s)]
*  know that Donald Trump does not believe that the election was stolen. That's what I believe from [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5478.88s)]
*  knowing him for 22 years and from being with him in much of the pre-election period and him expressing [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5486.08s)]
*  his very genuine concerns about the fact that he was losing to Biden and that he could lose to Biden, [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5494.72s)]
*  not because of mail-in ballots, because of COVID, that I don't believe he really believes the [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5501.4400000000005s)]
*  election was stolen. But can you prove that beyond a reasonable doubt? Well, that's the part [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5507.28s)]
*  that's aggressive, David. And I don't know all the evidence they have. I suspect they've got a number [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5511.84s)]
*  of people who are going to tell the jury that Trump told them that he thought he lost. But we're going [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5517.04s)]
*  to see. But we're going to see. And that's why I call it aggressive. By the way, let me just get on [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5525.2s)]
*  the record here that I agree with you that a lot of the underlying behavior was really bad. And I've [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5529.92s)]
*  said so on the pod before. I'm not defending the underlying behavior. What I question is the wisdom [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5534.32s)]
*  of one president, basically Biden, his Justice Department going after the former president who [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5539.759999999999s)]
*  is currently the leading candidate in the election against him and doing it within a year before the [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5546.5599999999995s)]
*  election as opposed to three years ago. How is that wise? David, let me ask you a question. First [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5553.12s)]
*  off, if they hadn't died, if they hadn't died at Donald Trump, six months after January 6, [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5558.96s)]
*  you know what everybody would have said? Rush to judgment. No good investigation. They had this [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5565.44s)]
*  pre-determined. You can't win as a prosecutor on that one. Either you went too quick or you waited [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5571.44s)]
*  too long. So I don't buy that at all. I think it's bull. Now, on the question of whether or not [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5579.44s)]
*  a president should allow his Justice Department to charge someone who is his predecessor and [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5587.44s)]
*  potentially an opponent again. Well, what's the alternative? Let's say on let's take it away from [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5596.16s)]
*  the January 6 one and look at the documents one. If he obstructed justice, if he lied and obstructed [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5602.4s)]
*  the grand jury subpoena, if he kept classified documents he was not entitled to keep and then [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5610.48s)]
*  hid them from his own lawyers when they were trying to respond to that. If he instructed people [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5616.32s)]
*  to delete surveillance camera video, which would have shown him having people move those documents, [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5621.12s)]
*  then all you have to do is declare for president and you don't get prosecuted. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5627.92s)]
*  I mean, I understand it's a lousy situation, but there are a number of people who believe [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5633.04s)]
*  that the only reason Donald Trump is running for president again is to be able to make that argument. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5638.799999999999s)]
*  And so I understand it's an awful no, no, I think he wants retribution from the seat of power [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5644.96s)]
*  for everybody who governor. Hold on. I want to ask you a question. No, no, no, no, I want to ask [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5654.08s)]
*  why you did for under I'll do one. So Governor Christie, let me ask you a question because you [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5658.799999999999s)]
*  know Trump. Do you think he tried to overturn the election? And do you think given the chance to [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5663.28s)]
*  overturn the election and steal the election, Donald Trump based on your knowledge of his [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5669.12s)]
*  character for multiple decades and working with him? Do you think he would have done it? Do you [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5673.44s)]
*  think he's that criminal minded? I don't think he would have any he would have had any problem [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5677.36s)]
*  with the election being overturned. Okay. And I think if it if it if it was, he would have been [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5684.4s)]
*  more than happy to have his rear end sleeping in the White House tonight. Now, I think he evolved [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5690.16s)]
*  to that position. In this respect, I've had the opportunity to meet [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5700.16s)]
*  a number of different presidents, every president going back to Bush 41. Every one of them, [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5707.36s)]
*  regardless of my disagreements with them on policy, were matured and humbled by the office, [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5714.4s)]
*  except for him. Okay, well, so the office made him worse. It made him a worse person. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5724.56s)]
*  I've known him for 22 years. The guy I met in 2001 would not have done [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5731.6s)]
*  what 2020 Donald Trump did. And I think he is a perfect example of power, having corrupted someone [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5739.68s)]
*  to the point where he was willing to not only engage in that conduct, but to essentially [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5747.68s)]
*  threaten his own vice president to try to get him to do something. Do you think Russia played a [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5755.04s)]
*  played a role in that? I mean, meaning here, Donald Trump, you know, he's the ultimate outsider, [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5760.88s)]
*  maybe has a chip on his shoulder about not being accepted in, you know, by certain elements of [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5765.68s)]
*  society. He wins the White House is this huge shock. And rather than accepting it, the entire [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5770.4800000000005s)]
*  Democratic Party said his election was illegitimate. And they claimed that basically [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5775.52s)]
*  somehow Putin masterminded it. And then they subjected him to two years of this Mueller [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5779.120000000001s)]
*  investigation, which turned up nothing, but they claimed that he was based on an agent. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5783.92s)]
*  It used to believe in the PTA. You still believe in the steel. You still believe in the steel [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5788.72s)]
*  dossier. Okay. But a lot of people went to jail and he did. Still dossier was completely made. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5793.360000000001s)]
*  I didn't talk about the sale dossier. I'm talking about their relationship with Russia. That was [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5799.360000000001s)]
*  the basis for the whole I'm talking about him asking for help from Russia. You're the last person [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5802.48s)]
*  to live in that simulation. That's not correct. I'm asking the governor a question. Do you think [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5807.2s)]
*  that two years of this Russia gate hoax basically drove Trump to this behavior or played a role in [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5811.2s)]
*  it? I'll go with your with your last piece, not the first one. I had no doubt that it contributed [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5817.28s)]
*  to his feeling that people were after him. No doubt. And I said from the beginning, I thought [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5825.28s)]
*  the Russia thing was complete crap. And the reason I thought it was was because I was there in 2016. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5830.64s)]
*  That campaign was so bad and so disorganized, they couldn't have arranged a two car funeral, [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5836.96s)]
*  let alone conspired with the Russian government to interfere with the election. I was there. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5844.64s)]
*  It was amateurish and it won because they ran against the worst presidential candidate in my [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5851.92s)]
*  lifetime in Hillary Clinton. So I said from the beginning, I thought the Russia investigation was [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5859.04s)]
*  illegitimate and was wrong. Do I think it contributed to his attitude? I think it did. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5865.2s)]
*  But I don't think David, it would be fair to say that that's what made him that way. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5869.76s)]
*  Okay, fair enough. Fair enough. I think there's a lot more that contributed to it than that. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5876.4s)]
*  But yeah, I would certainly concede that because I objected to the Russia investigation at the time [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5882.08s)]
*  in real time. Kudos to you for that because I think you've been vindicated by what's happened [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5888.48s)]
*  in the last few years. Last question for me on documents. Okay, do you think that there's a [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5893.36s)]
*  selective prosecution issue here? Because Sandy Berger stuffed documents in his pants from a [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5899.36s)]
*  clean room, never prosecuted. Petraeus had a huge classified documents problem, slap on the wrist. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5905.28s)]
*  I mean, it seems like, and by the way, Biden had documents by his beloved Corvette and in offices [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5911.28s)]
*  all over the place going back many years. So I mean, isn't this documents case, it seems like [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5917.44s)]
*  no one really wanted to prosecute this law until Trump did it. And now it's like, get Trump. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5922.799999999999s)]
*  Now, look, I think Trump did this one to himself, David. If he had turned over the documents he [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5928.879999999999s)]
*  illegally had at any point when he was being requested to from February of 2021, through to [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5934.639999999999s)]
*  when the search occurred, there would be no prosecution. Well, I agree with that. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5943.36s)]
*  And the proof of that. Why did he prosecute these other guys? [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5947.839999999999s)]
*  Because they gave the documents back. Because look, Biden gave the documents back. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5950.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, Pence gave the documents back when asked what this guy did was obstructed it [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5955.599999999999s)]
*  in every way he could. I don't want people looking through my boxes, my boxes. This guy is like a [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5962.32s)]
*  freak. And about these boxes, I'm telling you, he I used to campaign with him, he would have a box of [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5968.88s)]
*  documents. Now back then, it was 2016. It was a box of documents from Trump Tower. No one could [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5975.12s)]
*  touch them. No one could look at them. He'd go through them a little bit. But they he literally [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5981.36s)]
*  had a seat for his box of documents next to him on his plane. No one could sit next to him. The [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5987.28s)]
*  box of documents went next to him. So there's a psychosis here on the documents, David. That's [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5994.08s)]
*  deep. All right. Okay. But maybe, but maybe that indicates this to himself. He did it to himself. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=5999.5199999999995s)]
*  Walked into it. I agree. He totally walked into this. He sprinted into it with his arms wide open [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6005.68s)]
*  and he screwed himself. But in the process, he screwed the country. But what you're describing [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6011.84s)]
*  is an idiosyncratic issue. He liked his boxes. He had mementos in them. This was not a national [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6017.36s)]
*  security issue. Oh, sure it was. How sure it was. How you cannot permit the president United States [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6022.0s)]
*  to be flashing around in a ran war plan on the on the deck in Mar-a-Lago. Sorry, not allowed, [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6028.64s)]
*  especially not after your president. And you know what? He could have declassified any documents [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6036.56s)]
*  he wanted to when he was president. He didn't. And now he's trying to say he mind melted them [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6041.92s)]
*  to be declassified. Come on, David, this stuff is such bullshit. It's, it's, it's laughable. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6046.48s)]
*  But you agree the president, the president has an unlimited authority to declassify documents, [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6052.32s)]
*  right? So he, so he didn't do it through the process you wanted, but who's to say that he [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6056.5599999999995s)]
*  didn't do it? No, his attorney general said he didn't do it. His White House counsel said he [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6061.2s)]
*  didn't do it. So who's to say his view, he declassified other documents the appropriate way. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6066.4s)]
*  These he just thought about declassifying. Therefore they were declassified. Come on. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6073.04s)]
*  I agree. It's a bad argument. But I guess it's not a bad argument. It's not a bad argument. It's not [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6077.5199999999995s)]
*  an argument. Come back anytime you want. Chris, it's not an argument. I think you got to sit in. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6085.12s)]
*  I mean, look, I, you know, I will tell you guys, like, I am very sympathetic to executive authority. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6089.84s)]
*  I've been a governor of the state that has the strongest constitutional governorship [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6097.76s)]
*  in America, but you gotta follow the law. When the law empowers you to the extent that the United [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6102.72s)]
*  States president is empowered, that should be enough. You shouldn't have to act outside the law. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6110.320000000001s)]
*  And here's why he did it. He didn't do it to sell the documents. He didn't do them to give them to [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6116.400000000001s)]
*  some foreign power. He did them to show off. Look what I have. Look, I'm still really the president. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6122.160000000001s)]
*  This is the real core problem with him, David, but doesn't this pale in comparison to the crimes [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6131.04s)]
*  of the Biden family? I mean, let's see. Peter, I don't know. Are we, do we have time to talk about [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6136.719999999999s)]
*  the $2 billion that Jared Kushner has gotten from the Saudis and why he got that money? Is it because [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6143.599999999999s)]
*  he's such an expert investor, the guy who bought six, six, six fifth Avenue and nearly bankrupted [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6150.48s)]
*  his entire company? I mean, he's actually a pretty smart guy. I mean, oh yeah. Oh no, he's a genius. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6156.64s)]
*  He's an absolute genius, David. And that's why the Saudis gave him $2 billion. He was out of office. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6163.76s)]
*  We're talking about, we're talking about, we're talking about the family Biden is vice president [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6170.240000000001s)]
*  and his son, which grip running around the world collecting money. David, what, why would a president [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6176.4800000000005s)]
*  of the United States, when he has somebody like Mike Pompeo as his secretary of state, [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6182.32s)]
*  who's been a Congressman, a West Point graduate, member of the military CIA director, secretary [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6187.759999999999s)]
*  of state, why has he said to Jared Kushner over to negotiate with the Saudis? He got the Abraham [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6195.599999999999s)]
*  Accords gun. No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no, he gets the, you know, oh, so now [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6202.32s)]
*  we're not giving Pompeo the credit for the Abraham Accords. It's Jared Kushner. Look, in the end, [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6207.92s)]
*  Abraham Accords were a good idea or a bad idea. Great idea. Great idea. I want you to give [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6216.24s)]
*  Kushner credit. He was involved. No, no, no. He's involved. Congratulations. Why was he sent in the [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6220.4800000000005s)]
*  first place? Because of his extensive, his extensive foreign policy experience, managing, managing [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6227.4400000000005s)]
*  apartment buildings in New Jersey. That's what he was doing. So look, I absolutely believe [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6233.36s)]
*  that as I answered your question very directly before, that the only reason Hunter Biden was [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6243.679999999999s)]
*  hired for these things was to get influence with his father. Absolutely. Now I think he should go [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6248.24s)]
*  to jail, but we can't look at the Jared and Ivanka making 40 plus million dollars a year [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6253.28s)]
*  while they were in the White House, getting two billion from the Saudis to invest [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6260.56s)]
*  after they leave the White House and say that's not a grift as well, not to mention the fact [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6264.96s)]
*  that he's spending campaign money to pay his legal fees when he's supposed to be a billionaire. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6271.120000000001s)]
*  How about you sell the Trump Tower apartment since you don't live there anymore and pay your legal [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6277.200000000001s)]
*  fees with that? Or how about sell one of your frigging golf courses to pay your legal fees [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6282.080000000001s)]
*  with that, but instead at a $100 average donation from Americans who donated to something called [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6287.84s)]
*  Save America, which was supposed to fight the steal of the election, is now being spent to [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6294.8s)]
*  pay his legal fees because he took classified documents illegally out of the White House. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6301.28s)]
*  And by the way, that same organization paid Kimberly Guilfoyle 60 grand to give a three-minute [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6306.88s)]
*  speech on January 6th and paid $208,000 to Melania Stylist as political strategy. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6312.4s)]
*  She looks great. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6320.799999999999s)]
*  There's plenty of grift to go around. And I'll tell you this. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6321.92s)]
*  The grift is deep. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6324.4s)]
*  The Christie administration, no member of my family will make money off of the fact [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6325.679999999999s)]
*  that I'm president. You can't say that about Trump or Biden. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6329.92s)]
*  Okay. This has been an amazing two hours. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6333.759999999999s)]
*  Killing me. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6337.28s)]
*  With Governor Chris Christie. Well done. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6337.839999999999s)]
*  So on. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6340.5599999999995s)]
*  Well done. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6341.04s)]
*  I had these lozenges. All right. I have no voice. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6342.56s)]
*  Final question. When you did this karaoke with David Freberg, did you do Thunder Road, [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6345.76s)]
*  Living on a Prayer, Rosalita? What was the song or did you guys do? [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6353.28s)]
*  Okay. I got to admit, I don't remember. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6357.68s)]
*  I don't remember which song David and I did together, but I did do Thunder Road, [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6360.08s)]
*  karaoke in that small bar in that little town in Idaho. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6365.12s)]
*  Be prevent. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6370.400000000001s)]
*  I think I do also remember there being a karaoke on a Backstreet Boys song. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6371.44s)]
*  Oh, that's definitely free. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6379.599999999999s)]
*  But yeah, it's definitely free. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6380.639999999999s)]
*  And I don't think Freeberg was in that one. I don't think. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6382.0s)]
*  Do you remember, David, which song we did? [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6385.36s)]
*  No. Endless love. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6387.28s)]
*  I don't remember. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6388.639999999999s)]
*  No, it definitely wasn't that. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6390.08s)]
*  There was a group. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6391.04s)]
*  Don't go breaking my heart. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6391.839999999999s)]
*  T.T. D. Elton John. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6392.879999999999s)]
*  There's gotta be one in there. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6395.28s)]
*  Listen, Governor, we really appreciate you coming on. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6396.4s)]
*  We wish you great success. Congratulations on New Hampshire. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6399.84s)]
*  And really, really thank you. Did a great job today. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6402.8s)]
*  Thank you for being so forthright. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6406.56s)]
*  Thank you guys for giving me that. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6408.88s)]
*  Look, I love the opportunity to be able to go [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6410.64s)]
*  into more depth about this in anything other than UFOs. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6412.96s)]
*  So that's really, really good. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6417.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, wait, we have another hour of UFO questions. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6419.280000000001s)]
*  I would really encourage you to spread this gospel of the most thoughtful way to beat back corruption [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6422.8s)]
*  is something like zero based budgeting across the entire federal government. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6428.96s)]
*  I like that, too. That was a great. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6432.4s)]
*  Nobody says it. People are, I think, RFK and Vivek scratch it. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6433.92s)]
*  But I think you could nail it if you take it and want to run with it. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6440.88s)]
*  And there's just a lot of money that's probably sloshing on the [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6443.92s)]
*  sidelines that needs to get reallocated. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6448.8s)]
*  And I'm sure you saw how viral John Seward's interview with the [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6450.88s)]
*  Undersecretary of Defense for Budget went. That was an incredible interview. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6454.56s)]
*  And obviously it hits a nerve with a lot of people. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6458.72s)]
*  So it's a really important point. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6460.96s)]
*  It speaks a lot to the broader issue. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6462.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, I'm glad to be here. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6465.04s)]
*  I'm happy that I did not take my son's briefing, [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6467.76s)]
*  but I can guarantee you that he's going to be listening. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6471.04s)]
*  He's very stressed. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6473.360000000001s)]
*  He's actually he works for the New York Mets. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6474.8s)]
*  He's down in the Dominican Republic today. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6477.280000000001s)]
*  Who? [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6479.360000000001s)]
*  And he called me from the D.R. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6479.68s)]
*  And he said, is today the all in day? [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6480.96s)]
*  And I said, yes, today's the day. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6483.4400000000005s)]
*  He goes, call me right afterwards. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6485.04s)]
*  He's going to tell him. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6487.76s)]
*  What are you going to tell him? [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6488.64s)]
*  I'm going to tell him it was great. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6489.360000000001s)]
*  We had a great two hours and he's going to enjoy listening to it. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6490.400000000001s)]
*  And now anytime you guys want me back, I'm back. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6493.68s)]
*  Fix the next. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6497.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6498.08s)]
*  You're on the board there, too. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6498.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a bigger problem. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6500.16s)]
*  That may be worse than zero based budgeting. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6502.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6503.92s)]
*  At least the Knicks look like they build a nice foundation here. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6504.8s)]
*  I like where they are. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6507.28s)]
*  Don't give up on the Mets yet. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6508.4800000000005s)]
*  Wait till next year. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6509.92s)]
*  I'm not giving up. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6510.56s)]
*  We'll get there. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6512.0s)]
*  All right. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6513.2s)]
*  Two hours with the governor going around the horn here. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6514.24s)]
*  Friedberg, your thoughts after two hours with Governor Christie? [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6516.4s)]
*  Where was he strong? [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6520.24s)]
*  Where do you disagree with him? [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6521.679999999999s)]
*  What do you think of his presidency after two hours of intimate discussion here on All in Podcast? [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6523.2s)]
*  I don't know if I've got a huge shift in opinion. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6528.96s)]
*  He's a very personable guy. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6532.96s)]
*  He has a good command of the subjects. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6534.799999999999s)]
*  He's got good experience running a state. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6537.12s)]
*  So those are good qualifying criteria. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6539.92s)]
*  Obviously, this is a very challenging race for him. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6541.759999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure if he hits any zingers that really helps accelerate him past the momentum that Vivek has [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6543.76s)]
*  and obviously the lead that Trump has with the conservative party support with DeSantis. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6550.400000000001s)]
*  It seems like it's going to be a tough campaign and a tough race for him. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6556.56s)]
*  I'm not sure he brings anything today that shows how he's going to get ahead of this problem. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6559.68s)]
*  So that's the campaign. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6564.64s)]
*  Let's talk about for you. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6566.4800000000005s)]
*  If you were to contrast him to other Republican candidates, [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6568.4800000000005s)]
*  DeSantis, Halle, Vivek, what does he fall for you personally? [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6571.52s)]
*  Yeah, I remain of the concern that there's a giant meteor hitting a fiscal meteor hitting the United States. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6577.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6584.240000000001s)]
*  And everyone's talking about a lot of other stuff. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6584.56s)]
*  And it's the Don't Look Up documentary to me. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6587.120000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6589.68s)]
*  And he's the most attuned to that in your mind or Nikki Halle? [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6589.92s)]
*  He has a good point of view. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6593.040000000001s)]
*  I think his alignment around keeping military spending and this discussion around corruption, [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6593.92s)]
*  it's such a micro problem relative to the macro condition. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6601.2s)]
*  Again, 31% of US debt coming up for refinancing this year. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6607.28s)]
*  It's going to be, you know, and we're already seeing, by the way, this year, [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6612.4800000000005s)]
*  interest expense on the debt is greater than the military spending. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6615.04s)]
*  If you had to pick two candidates on the Republican party that were most intriguing to you for your [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6619.52s)]
*  vote, which two would they be? [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6624.0s)]
*  I'm going to skip that question for now. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6625.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6627.52s)]
*  Chamath, I'll go to you. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6628.400000000001s)]
*  Post this two hour discussion. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6629.52s)]
*  I thought he was great. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6632.240000000001s)]
*  I'm curious how you thought were the strong points in this discussion. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6633.200000000001s)]
*  And then I guess we can talk about his campaign as Freeberg just did. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6637.360000000001s)]
*  But then we could also talk about how he resonates with you. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6641.76s)]
*  And in terms of getting your vote, maybe where he sits. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6644.72s)]
*  I don't think my opinion has changed much before or after. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6647.84s)]
*  I mean, I think that he's a very personable, charming guy, but I'm not sure that he says [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6651.84s)]
*  anything that's different from the establishment wing of the Republican party. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6658.4s)]
*  And I think that the winning candidate, whether I agree with it or not, is irrelevant at this [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6664.32s)]
*  point. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6669.28s)]
*  But the formula has been laid bare for everybody to see. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6670.0s)]
*  And I think that you have to have radical ideas. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6672.96s)]
*  And so when you think about the people that are getting the most attention on both the [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6676.4s)]
*  Democratic and the Republican side, what they're essentially pushing back on is all of this [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6680.879999999999s)]
*  orthodoxy. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6687.36s)]
*  And if he really wants to win, he has to embrace being unorthodox and heterodox. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6689.28s)]
*  And he doesn't have enough heterodox policies to cut through. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6696.799999999999s)]
*  So he just cannot win as a practical matter. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6700.88s)]
*  So if he embraces those heterodoxies because he believes in them, he has a chance. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6704.5599999999995s)]
*  But if he doesn't, it's going to be Trump versus Vivek. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6710.88s)]
*  So if it winds up being Biden, Vivek, Trump, Christie, Nikki in this final race towards [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6715.36s)]
*  finish line, which two candidates do you find most appealing right now? [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6725.5199999999995s)]
*  Not saying your vote for them, but which two are resonating with Chamath, Polyhapiti, and most? [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6729.04s)]
*  I'm still pretty open-minded. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6735.36s)]
*  I haven't decided. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6736.639999999999s)]
*  I know who doesn't resonate with me is DeSantis. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6737.36s)]
*  OK, so DeSantis is off the table. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6740.799999999999s)]
*  Everybody else is still in play. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6742.4s)]
*  And I was very clear early on that his campaign was DOA. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6744.24s)]
*  And I think that that's probably just going to—he's going to have a [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6747.04s)]
*  withering, kind of embarrassing end to the campaign, unfortunately, for him. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6750.88s)]
*  But I think the heterodoxical rhetoric is going to get ramped up both by RFK and by Vivek. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6756.0s)]
*  And I think it's going to put a lot of pressure—and by Trump. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6764.719999999999s)]
*  And I think it's going to put a lot of pressure on Biden, and it's going to put a lot of pressure [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6766.96s)]
*  on the other Republican nominees to come through the noise here. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6770.8s)]
*  It's an interesting point, Chamath, because if the chorus becomes this heterodox point of view, [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6773.6s)]
*  it looks really bad. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6780.96s)]
*  Biden is almost in this truly defensive mode, because then you have multiple parties [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6782.8s)]
*  speaking similarly about the establishment. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6787.4400000000005s)]
*  I think there's a very good chance that Biden's son— [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6789.6s)]
*  He's indicted this week. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6792.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6793.28s)]
*  Is in jail by the time the election comes around, which I think also speaks very poorly [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6793.68s)]
*  to the risk that there is some clear links of corruption that come out. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6800.400000000001s)]
*  And I think that that's going to put the election under severe pressure. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6807.84s)]
*  And I think you can bet that every single Republican mega donor is going to come out [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6813.120000000001s)]
*  of the woodwork to fund the super PAC. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6820.400000000001s)]
*  That's going to blast the airwaves all across the country with that content. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6822.72s)]
*  So that's, I think, a foregone conclusion if it looks like there is fire where there looks [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6827.04s)]
*  right now is smoke. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6833.2s)]
*  And if David Weiss acts this decisively and it moves the trial quickly, which I suspect it will, [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6834.4s)]
*  this is all bad news for Biden. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6841.28s)]
*  And so you have that on that side. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6843.5199999999995s)]
*  The Republicans have the red meat that they need. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6846.4s)]
*  The heterodoxy on both sides is what's getting all the attention. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6849.28s)]
*  So I think what Donald Trump did in hindsight was really break the glass on being able to say [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6852.96s)]
*  the things you couldn't say. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6859.36s)]
*  And that will now be the formula for candidates to win. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6860.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6864.72s)]
*  Just for folks who haven't been watching the news, the Justice Department is believed to [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6865.92s)]
*  indict Hunter on the gun charges this month. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6871.6s)]
*  I think they're still investigating the potential corruption where there's smoke. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6873.84s)]
*  Maybe there's fire. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6878.88s)]
*  And if it leads to Biden. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6880.72s)]
*  And so this whole race could be totally flipped upside down at any moment. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6881.92s)]
*  Same with Trump and his indictments. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6885.360000000001s)]
*  The gun charge is a nothing charge. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6886.4800000000005s)]
*  Just so everyone understands what that is, when he applied to get a firearm, you have to check off [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6888.400000000001s)]
*  these check boxes on the form. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6894.88s)]
*  And one of them is apparently that you don't have a drug problem. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6896.96s)]
*  And so he lied on that form, I guess. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6900.72s)]
*  But that's the kind of charge that I personally don't believe they should be going [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6905.04s)]
*  after him for because I don't think they would prosecute an ordinary person for that. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6909.52s)]
*  Yeah. And in his defense, Hunter said, I have no problem scoring drugs. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6913.6s)]
*  So I don't have a drug problem. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6916.56s)]
*  I can get them any time I need them. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6917.6s)]
*  It's one of these weird kind of almost again, like a paperwork charge. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6918.96s)]
*  And remember that what the DOJ tried to do was a settlement with Hunter Biden, [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6922.96s)]
*  where he would plead guilty on that same gun charge because it's kind of a nothing charge. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6929.360000000001s)]
*  But then buried deep in that settlement was a broad immunity on all the foreign lobbying [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6933.040000000001s)]
*  he was doing, the Farah Act violations. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6939.2s)]
*  And then it came out and the judge said, wait a second, like that's too much. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6941.5199999999995s)]
*  Like, what are you doing? [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6945.84s)]
*  And they reject the judge rejected the settlement. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6946.5599999999995s)]
*  So frankly, I view the charges by the DOJ on the gun charge as a misdirection [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6948.5599999999995s)]
*  of what the real issue is with Hunter Biden. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6955.2s)]
*  He was running around the world collecting money with being an unregistered foreign [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6956.96s)]
*  agent, foreign lobbyist. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6962.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6963.92s)]
*  That's the crux of the issue is that's the corruption. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6964.24s)]
*  Alleged. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6967.44s)]
*  Alleged. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6968.0s)]
*  Alleged. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6968.88s)]
*  But the point is, that's what the DOJ should be looking at. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6969.68s)]
*  Not these like- [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6972.88s)]
*  Well, that's what they are looking at. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6973.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6974.56s)]
*  Did Hunter use drugs in the wrong way? [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6974.64s)]
*  I think looking at the tax evasion, tax fraud charges, that is their way of looking at that. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6977.2s)]
*  So I think it's going to come out. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6981.36s)]
*  I think at this point- [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6982.56s)]
*  Yeah, no, they're looking at both. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6983.28s)]
*  Everybody will have the truth. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6985.04s)]
*  If the Bidens are truly not guilty, that will be clearly established now in this process. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6987.28s)]
*  But if he was acting as an unregistered agent of these foreign governments, that is also [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6992.32s)]
*  going to come out. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6997.52s)]
*  And if there were links between him and his father and communications, that's also going [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=6998.4800000000005s)]
*  to come out. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7003.200000000001s)]
*  I think that- [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7003.6s)]
*  But he hasn't even been indicted on that yet, right? [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7004.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7006.240000000001s)]
*  I understand. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7006.64s)]
*  It takes time. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7007.120000000001s)]
*  I think it takes time. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7007.68s)]
*  I think they will thoughtfully put it together, but- [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7008.8s)]
*  I'm not confident about it. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7011.360000000001s)]
*  Given that they wanted to give him broad immunity on those charges, I think that- [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7012.4800000000005s)]
*  No, but I think David Weiss is under such a microscope right now. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7016.0s)]
*  The idea that he doesn't act conclusively here, I think, would be a huge problem. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7019.360000000001s)]
*  And then the next president, if it's Republican, will reopen it. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7023.92s)]
*  Whatever happens here will need to be definitive. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7026.96s)]
*  And I think the special prosecutor probably understands that at this point. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7029.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7032.48s)]
*  So let's go back to your impressions before we go down the Biden, Biden, Biden rabbit hole here. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7032.96s)]
*  What are your thoughts after two hours with Chris Christie? [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7038.719999999999s)]
*  Anything change in your outlook on him? [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7041.12s)]
*  And then I'm curious, are you still team DeSantis all the way? [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7043.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7047.599999999999s)]
*  So on Christie, I like talking to him more than I thought I was going to. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7047.92s)]
*  I think he was easy to talk to. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7054.4s)]
*  I think the two hours went by pretty quickly. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7055.84s)]
*  I think he brought his energy level down to the right place for a podcast. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7058.16s)]
*  It was a little different than when he's very pugnacious on the debate stage and [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7063.92s)]
*  grandstand. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7068.72s)]
*  And he engaged in a discussion with us. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7069.6s)]
*  So I thought that was positive. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7072.400000000001s)]
*  The only time his energy really changed was basically in the last five minutes, [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7074.16s)]
*  when he went on to a full-on Trump diatribe. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7078.32s)]
*  And it was almost like, you know, a little bit of TDS kicked in. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7082.16s)]
*  That being said, his position on Trump was a little bit more nuanced than I was expecting. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7086.16s)]
*  First of all, he admitted the whole Russiagate thing was total baloney. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7091.44s)]
*  Second, he said that with respect to these state charges, [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7094.64s)]
*  the Alvin Bragg in New York and the Fannie Willis in Atlanta, [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7098.4s)]
*  those charges should not have been brought. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7101.6s)]
*  Yeah, that was pretty good. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7103.04s)]
*  I kind of agree with him on those. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7104.08s)]
*  I agree with his, I thought that was intellectually honest. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7105.5199999999995s)]
*  Did you feel intellectual honesty from him? [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7108.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I think he really believes this. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7110.32s)]
*  Third, it took a couple of tries by Chamath and then me to get him to say this, but he said he [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7112.5599999999995s)]
*  would not put Trump in jail. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7118.08s)]
*  He's too old for that. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7119.92s)]
*  And I thought that was, I wasn't sure where he was going to come out on that. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7120.88s)]
*  I didn't know if he was going to say Trump deserves a life sentence or not. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7124.0s)]
*  We should have asked him if he would pardon him, if he was president. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7127.2s)]
*  He did. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7129.36s)]
*  He said, he said, I wouldn't pardon him, but I commute his sentence. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7129.68s)]
*  So he didn't have to spend time in jail. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7133.28s)]
*  So I thought that was new information. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7135.2s)]
*  And again, a more nuanced view than I was expecting. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7137.76s)]
*  On the documents case, he said that Trump ran into the charges, which frankly, I agree with. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7140.64s)]
*  I think Trump could have avoided that easily. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7145.68s)]
*  However, Christie said he did it for idiosyncratic reasons. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7148.0s)]
*  He loves his box of mementos. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7150.8s)]
*  Yes. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7153.04s)]
*  He didn't really address my point. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7153.6s)]
*  Same very you and I have. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7154.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7155.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7156.4800000000005s)]
*  You know who else loves their mementos? [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7157.280000000001s)]
*  I have, I have a handful of kids under the age of five who love blankets and. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7159.200000000001s)]
*  Yes, the blankie, pacifiers. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7162.88s)]
*  Teddy. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7165.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7167.12s)]
*  I would just go a little further and just say, listen, if he did this for idiosyncratic [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7167.36s)]
*  reasons rather than nefarious reasons, like selling state secrets, then I think you apply [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7170.96s)]
*  the same standard of prosecution as they did to portray us or to Biden himself. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7175.679999999999s)]
*  The thing you keep missing is that those people gave those back. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7181.599999999999s)]
*  You keep missing that, I don't know why you have that blind spot. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7185.04s)]
*  Because he basically said that Trump has an anxiety complex and he sued, he self-sudes [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7187.5199999999995s)]
*  with that box of documents. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7192.48s)]
*  That's what he said. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7194.32s)]
*  Cuckoo Gaga, cuckoo Gaga. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7195.76s)]
*  No, but that's what he said. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7197.92s)]
*  I would treat Trump the same way as Sandy Berger. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7199.36s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7201.84s)]
*  Those guys. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7202.64s)]
*  No, let's just move on. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7203.12s)]
*  Let's just move on. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7204.32s)]
*  Let's shut justice. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7204.56s)]
*  Let's just keep moving. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7205.36s)]
*  Are you still teasing the Sanders? [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7206.4s)]
*  Let's just keep moving on. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7207.28s)]
*  The last point was on the Jack Smith charges where he admitted that Jack Smith has to prove [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7208.64s)]
*  beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump knew that his election denial argument was false. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7216.24s)]
*  I think he pretty much admitted that that would be a very, very hard thing to prove, [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7223.4400000000005s)]
*  but he said he wanted to wait to see what evidence they had. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7227.76s)]
*  To me, that begs the question of why you bring that case in the first place. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7231.04s)]
*  Any event, so that's on Trump. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7235.04s)]
*  I think what I saw there was a little bit of TDS, but a more nuanced overall perspective [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7236.400000000001s)]
*  when you got into the details. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7240.8s)]
*  On foreign policy, I think we had a lot of interesting conversation there about [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7242.400000000001s)]
*  the mismanagement of the military industrial complex. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7247.92s)]
*  I think Jamath had some really interesting questions there that I followed up on. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7251.68s)]
*  Really, you couldn't get him to say anything other than he wouldn't necessarily increase [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7256.72s)]
*  the size of the defense budget until you did the efficiency survey, but he had to be pushed [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7262.16s)]
*  to even get there. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7267.6s)]
*  What I would just say is that on that question, on military spending combined with [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7268.96s)]
*  the question of Ukraine, he pretty much has the standard establishment Republican position, [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7274.240000000001s)]
*  which is the only thing Biden has done wrong, is not move aggressively enough on Ukraine, [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7279.44s)]
*  that giving mixed messages, not being hawkish enough. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7285.28s)]
*  I'm sorry, but Biden has had the most hawkish policy on Ukraine that any president's ever had. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7288.16s)]
*  The only reason there's been handwringing about giving them F-16s is because it could [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7294.639999999999s)]
*  start World War III. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7298.719999999999s)]
*  I personally want Biden thinking about that. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7300.32s)]
*  Again, I think this neocon Republican position that involves Chris Christie and [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7303.919999999999s)]
*  Haley and Pence and Mitch McConnell, basically the whole Republican establishment, [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7309.12s)]
*  they basically believe that Biden, who says we need to support Ukraine for as long as it takes, [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7314.400000000001s)]
*  as much as it takes, he's still not doing enough. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7319.12s)]
*  I just don't fundamentally buy that argument. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7321.52s)]
*  You still team DeSantis? [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7323.4400000000005s)]
*  Here's my view on it. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7325.04s)]
*  So look, I would support DeSantis. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7326.160000000001s)]
*  I also would support Vivek. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7328.160000000001s)]
*  For me- [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7329.68s)]
*  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7330.4800000000005s)]
*  This is new information. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7331.200000000001s)]
*  So you're saying you are now equally open-minded to Vivek and DeSantis? [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7332.320000000001s)]
*  It's not equally minded, but look, for me- [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7337.52s)]
*  What percent? [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7339.52s)]
*  The most- Here's the way I divide it. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7340.0s)]
*  I divide candidates at this point into acceptable versus unacceptable. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7342.400000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7346.080000000001s)]
*  And for me, the number one issue is whether the president, the next president, [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7346.8s)]
*  will seek to de-escalate or end the Ukraine war or they will seek to escalate it. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7351.68s)]
*  Chris Christie, along with all these others, by saying that Biden has been too dovish on Ukraine, [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7356.96s)]
*  is effectively saying he wants to do even more on Ukraine. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7362.8s)]
*  I'm not willing to live for the next four years on the knife's edge of World War III. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7366.4s)]
*  I don't want the next US president- [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7372.8s)]
*  So that puts you in Vivek's camp? [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7373.84s)]
*  To put- I don't want the sword of World War III hanging over our heads. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7375.84s)]
*  So that puts you in Vivek's camp? [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7378.08s)]
*  Well, no. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7380.4s)]
*  I think that the candidates who said that they would either end or de-escalate [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7380.8s)]
*  Ukraine are Vivek, DeSantis, and Trump has said it. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7385.5199999999995s)]
*  They're the only three- Oh, and sorry, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7388.88s)]
*  Okay. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7392.16s)]
*  But you're not going to vote for him. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7392.48s)]
*  So that puts you in Vivek. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7394.16s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7395.84s)]
*  I mean, he might be my favorite, to be honest. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7396.64s)]
*  Would you pick him over Trump? [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7398.88s)]
*  I would certainly take Kennedy over Trump. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7400.0s)]
*  You would? [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7401.76s)]
*  Wow. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7402.24s)]
*  This is incredibly breaking news, folks. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7402.4800000000005s)]
*  This is all incredible. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7404.72s)]
*  Wow, Sachs. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7406.8s)]
*  Look, for me, this is the litmus test issue is, are you going to escalate or de-escalate [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7407.28s)]
*  the Ukraine war? [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7410.96s)]
*  And I think that these hawkish Republican candidates pose an unacceptable risk of World War III. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7412.96s)]
*  What do you think, Jason? [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7418.88s)]
*  Yeah, Jason, what do you think? [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7419.84s)]
*  I thought he broke your heart there in a couple of places. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7420.96s)]
*  No, actually, I don't expect all candidates to line up with my belief system perfectly. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7423.6s)]
*  Obviously, he's well-spoken. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7429.6s)]
*  Obviously, he's qualified. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7431.12s)]
*  I'm looking for a moderate like Freeberg. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7433.28s)]
*  I think the existential crisis of the balance sheet is my top issue. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7435.2s)]
*  I voted Republican about 25% and Democrats 75%. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7439.04s)]
*  I'm literally a moderate and an independent. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7442.88s)]
*  And right now, I really don't think Biden can be president or Trump. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7446.32s)]
*  So that leaves me with RFK on one side and it leaves me with Nikki Haley and Christy [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7450.88s)]
*  on the other side. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7456.88s)]
*  And Nikki Haley and Christy are really into balancing the budget. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7458.08s)]
*  And so I'm leaning towards voting Republican if those are the two candidates. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7460.8s)]
*  Now, the thing that I think handicapping this election is not being talked about all that [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7465.6s)]
*  much because we have the Trump-Biden rematch taking all the air out of the room is I don't [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7471.84s)]
*  know that Biden makes it to the starting line, nor do I think Trump makes it to the starting [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7476.4800000000005s)]
*  line. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7479.84s)]
*  And so that changes everything. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7480.24s)]
*  And who knows what percentage chance that is. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7482.16s)]
*  I don't think any of us can give it a perfect handicap. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7483.84s)]
*  But let's say that is the case. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7487.52s)]
*  Then I think there's a lot of lanes open here and I think the election will be once again [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7489.4400000000005s)]
*  determined by moderates and I think women who are still very much upset about the Roe v. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7493.4400000000005s)]
*  Wade issue. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7500.08s)]
*  And I think those two things are going to play a significant role. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7500.64s)]
*  And that's where I think Nikki Haley and Chris Christie believe it's a state's issue and [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7502.8s)]
*  they're not into the national ban for abortion. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7507.12s)]
*  I think moderates are not into Biden. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7510.4s)]
*  I think they were. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7512.96s)]
*  I don't think they're going to be into RFK. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7514.0s)]
*  I think they're going to be into Nikki Haley and I think Nikki Haley could happen. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7515.36s)]
*  And I think Chris Christie. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7518.32s)]
*  So I hope we get Nikki Haley on here because I don't know her enough, but I would like to [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7519.36s)]
*  have that to our discussion. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7522.88s)]
*  So I'm leaning towards Haley Christie if they make it. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7523.92s)]
*  All right. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7527.5199999999995s)]
*  This has been an amazing episode of the All In Podcast. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7527.92s)]
*  We went for over two hours. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7531.44s)]
*  Enjoy the one and a half times episode, everybody, because next week is the All In Summit and [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7532.88s)]
*  we're not going to tape next week. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odWe7qsrrGk&t=7538.24s)]
