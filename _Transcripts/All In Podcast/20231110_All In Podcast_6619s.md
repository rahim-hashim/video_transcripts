# In conversation with Jared Kushner Israel-Hamas War, paths forward, macro picture, AI
**All In Podcast:** [November 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94)
*  So what I say, were you writing last night till three in the morning? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=0.0s)]
*  Oh, I was blasting people on Twitter yesterday. I was collecting scalps. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2.32s)]
*  I keep these receipts of people who attack me on Ukraine. And then like six months later, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=9.68s)]
*  you know, they all write a tweet admitting they were wrong. So I'll rub it in their face. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  You have a little Google Doc and you just go. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=19.2s)]
*  You have like your kill Bill list. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you are so petty. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  Oh, I love that about you. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=28.24s)]
*  Some would say that's a good defense mechanism. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=31.279999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, they got to know they're not going to take any free shots because if they do, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=35.12s)]
*  and then invariably I'm proven correct, then you're going to clap back. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=39.12s)]
*  I'm going to smack them. Very Trumpian, isn't it? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=45.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very hard burden for you to carry. Just being right all the time. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=48.4s)]
*  I respect the way you do it with such grace and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  let your winners ride. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=59.2s)]
*  All right. Welcome back to the All In Pod. Really excited to have a guest with us today, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=74.64s)]
*  Jared Kushner. I'm sure everyone knows who he is. We obviously talked about Jared's interview with [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=79.6s)]
*  Lex Friedman on the pod a couple of weeks ago. And what happened to Matthew DM Jared and started [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=84.56s)]
*  chatting and said, Hey, would you be interested in coming to talk with us? Yeah. About these [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=90.56s)]
*  matters. Jared very, you know, kindly agreed to do it. So we're really excited to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=94.72s)]
*  have Jared join us today. Jared, welcome. Thank you for having me. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=99.76s)]
*  So I don't think you need much of an introduction. Obviously, you were a senior advisor to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=102.88s)]
*  president Trump from 2017 to 2021. And you worked on the US Mexico relationship as well as led the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=107.28s)]
*  Middle East peace efforts, which I think is going to make up the bulk of what we're excited to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=114.8s)]
*  talk about today. Just really briefly since leaving [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=120.08s)]
*  office, you've been investing running a firm called affinity partners. Is that right? Maybe [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=126.4s)]
*  you can share with us just a little bit about what you've been up to. And then we'll, you know, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=131.28s)]
*  kind of get into it here. Perfect affinity partners is a private equity firm that I started [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=134.56s)]
*  when we left doing growth investing, private equity investing. Globally, we raised just over 3.1 [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  billion, doing a lot of investments, trying to bring golf money into Israel into the US trying [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=143.68s)]
*  to figure out how through investments, you can bring countries closer together, people closer [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=149.68s)]
*  together, looking at a lot of areas where there's structural transitions happening at large in the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=154.24s)]
*  global economy, whether it's near shoring from offline to online, you know, software, a lot of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=159.92s)]
*  different interesting areas, a lot of the fintech space and financial services right now. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=165.11999999999998s)]
*  But you know, enjoying it. And the goal is really to bring the experience that we had from the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=169.92s)]
*  previously being an investor, and then the time in government, and then thinking through how you [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=174.88s)]
*  could use those macro learnings and connections and relationships and navigational skills to the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=180.0s)]
*  investing side. Right. So we're going to try and talk later in the show about macro markets a bit, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  talk a little bit about some of the activity in AI this week, we think it's all pretty [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=192.4s)]
*  prescient. And hopefully we can all dialogue about that. I think it'd be helpful when you and I [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=195.36s)]
*  talk just to get ready for the show today. You mentioned that you had a very liberal upbringing [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=200.88s)]
*  in the Upper East Side of New York, and your perspective began to shift as you started to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=206.32s)]
*  travel the country, then you were in the Trump White House and have become very active since, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=209.92s)]
*  would love to hear a little bit about how your perspective shifted in the time you spent, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=216.72s)]
*  because you mentioned you started traveling the country and seeing things that you otherwise [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=219.76s)]
*  haven't seen living in the Upper East Side. We'd love to hear that part of your story before we [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=222.64s)]
*  kind of get into things. If you wouldn't mind sharing. Yeah, sure. So one thing about my life [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=226.56s)]
*  is that nothing has gone according to the plan. I grew up in New Jersey, really nice place in [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=231.92s)]
*  Livingston. My father was an entrepreneur in the real estate business, banking, insurance, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=237.76s)]
*  did a lot of different things, really brought up me and my siblings to be focused on business. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=242.0s)]
*  And it really for us was a good experience growing up. I actually went to Harvard and then after [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=247.44s)]
*  that chose to go to law school and business school, where I was at NYU. During that time, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=253.2s)]
*  my father had a legal issue and I was forced to take over the business. And so I got into the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=258.96s)]
*  real estate business. And then after that, bought a media company in New York. And that's really [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=264.08s)]
*  where I got exposure to a lot of what are called New York society. My wife and I, we met, got married. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  And through that experience, I thought we had a very expanded worldview at our house in the Upper [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=274.64s)]
*  East Side. We have dinner parties, we have heads of banks and hedge funds and technology companies [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  and fashion. And then it was just, you know, really nice life. And then her father announced [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=284.08s)]
*  he was running for office. And that was an interesting experience for us as Republican, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=290.16s)]
*  we didn't know too many Republicans. Were you a registered Democrat prior? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=294.16s)]
*  I was registered Democrat going up. My father was a big Democrat donor we were we'd have in our house, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=299.76000000000005s)]
*  whether it be Chuck Schumer, Hillary Clinton, I think my father gave Cory Booker his first [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=304.56s)]
*  campaign donation. So I know Cory since I'm 15 years old. So really grew up around Democrat politics [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  all of our life. But over time, I think during the Obama years, I changed my registration to an [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=314.88s)]
*  independent I didn't feel like the Democrat Party was fully representing my viewpoints. I felt more [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=320.08s)]
*  independent minded. And then during the time with my father in law, when he was running for office, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=325.92s)]
*  he invited me to go with him to a rally in Springfield, Illinois, we flew out there, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=332.24s)]
*  I got off the plane. And, you know, we pull up to an arena and the guy comes up to Trump and says, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=335.6s)]
*  Congratulations, sir, you just broke the record for the arena for attendance. Then he says, well, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=341.36s)]
*  who had the who had the record before and he says, well, Elton John 36 years earlier. And he says, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=345.92s)]
*  Jared, look, I don't even have a guitar or piano. This is impressive, you know, so, you know, he [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=351.04s)]
*  gets up on stage and without really notes, you know, riffs for over an hour. And it was interesting [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=355.12s)]
*  for me because I was watching, you know, CNN and the New York Times and all my friends, the media [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=360.64000000000004s)]
*  basically were describing his rallies as almost like KKK conventions. But I walked around the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=364.48s)]
*  crowd, nobody knew who I was then. And what I saw was that these were just, you know, they were [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=369.68s)]
*  people were old, young, male, female, white minority. And, and, and it was just people who [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=373.76s)]
*  are hardworking Americans who, who, you know, really felt like Trump was giving them a voice. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=381.04s)]
*  And what was interesting to me was a couple weeks earlier, we'd been at the Robin Hood Foundation, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=385.44s)]
*  which is the big philanthropy in New York where a lot of the hedge fund managers support I remember [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=390.16s)]
*  the chairman of Robin Hood getting up and saying, you know, if we want to save, you know, the next [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=395.2s)]
*  generation, we want to save the kids in the inner cities, we have to, we have to support Common Core. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=399.68s)]
*  That's the way that we can save people. And I remember Trump gets up there and he says, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=405.36s)]
*  you know, if we want to save education, we have to end Common Core and send it to the states. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=409.84s)]
*  And I'm saying, wait, I thought, I thought Common Core was this great thing. And but why are all [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=413.52s)]
*  these people against it? And so it really just kind of piqued my interest and made me realize that [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=417.2s)]
*  maybe my aperture was was way smaller, way more closed than I thought it was. And it really led me [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=422.64s)]
*  to seek out a lot of people who had differing points of view than the people I'd been around [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=429.2s)]
*  before I really opened my aperture explored a lot. And over the years, I really got the chance to [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=434.15999999999997s)]
*  meet with people from both sides. So, you know, I have a lot of friends who are independent friends [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=439.76s)]
*  who are liberal friends who are very Republican. And, you know, my personal view was I thought of [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=443.44s)]
*  myself more as a pragmatist, fact based and data driven. And based on that, I tried to pursue [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=448.96s)]
*  the different policies that I thought made the most sense in as unemotional a way as possible. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=455.68s)]
*  How did you figure out that that moment in Springfield could translate all throughout [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=460.08s)]
*  the country? Like, was there a process that you guys went through to validate? Like, hold on, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=465.12s)]
*  is this just a moment in time? Or is this just a specific area? Or what is how did you guys get to [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=468.96s)]
*  the ground truth of what the scalable, marketable candidate looked like? Because I'm sure that was [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=474.96s)]
*  part of the calculus in what you did. Because I think to your point, maybe the media's perspective [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=481.28s)]
*  was hold on a second, this guy is riffing. But it clearly went very quickly from riffing to a [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=487.12s)]
*  methodical plan. And I don't think that that's ever really been talked about. Do you want to [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=492.88s)]
*  just tell us a little bit about that? Sure. Well, I would say it was less planned and way more [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=497.44s)]
*  entrepreneurial. And I say entrepreneurial in two different senses. You know, one is the campaign [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=502.08s)]
*  was one was run incredibly entrepreneurially. People were told that if you work for Trump, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=507.12s)]
*  you'll never get a job in Washington again, which is why he really wasn't able to hire a lot of [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=512.0799999999999s)]
*  people initially, and why a lot of the responsibility for the campaign fell to people like myself who [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=516.16s)]
*  really just cared about him personally, and wanted to make sure that he was able to do a competent job [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=521.4399999999999s)]
*  with the operations of a campaign that led to us doing a lot of things in an untraditional way. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=525.92s)]
*  But we actually were able to make the dollars go a lot further, whether it was building a data [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=530.4s)]
*  operation, or how we targeted advertisers, or how we did our events, we were able to just do it in a [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=533.92s)]
*  much different way. But from a viability of the candidate perspective, I really give all the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=539.36s)]
*  credit to him, because what I saw with politicians is a lot of politicians will take polls and then [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=543.92s)]
*  moderate their perspectives. This is somebody who without pollsters and without any political [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=549.1999999999999s)]
*  experience, really put forward a lot of points of view and keep in mind in a Republican primary, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=553.6s)]
*  a lot of his viewpoints on trade were very heterodoxical, they were not what was conventionally [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=559.52s)]
*  thought of. And what I saw with Trump was that he was able to move the polls to him. And that was [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=564.4s)]
*  a talent and just a skill of persuasion, and his willingness to kind of stick to the issues. And at [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=570.0799999999999s)]
*  that point in time, I remember seeing polls that illegal immigration was not like a top five issue [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=575.36s)]
*  when he started the campaign by the middle to end of the campaign, people were really seeing [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=579.92s)]
*  the craziness that was happening at the southern border and why that was critical to our national [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=584.88s)]
*  security. And so I think that for him, he found a lot of his message. And with him, he was not a [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=589.12s)]
*  perfectly always on message candidate. But what he did do was he was constantly evolving and learning [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=594.5600000000001s)]
*  and, you know, and would learn from the different things that happened and constantly evolving to [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=599.76s)]
*  find ways to persist. Amazing. Like a startup finding a product market fit. Yeah. What's he [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=605.04s)]
*  like as a father in law? I'm curious. As a father in law, he's been great, you know, that obviously [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=611.44s)]
*  brought us a lot closer together, you know, until that time, our time was mostly there playing golf [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=616.0s)]
*  together, we'd be together at family events, working together was, was was a different element [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=620.08s)]
*  of our relationship. But I think one of the benefits I had with him was that he knew I was [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=626.32s)]
*  always going to tell him the truth, whether I agreed with him or not. I also, I think one of [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=630.24s)]
*  the things he liked about me was that I was not obviously worked hard, I gave him straight answers, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=635.36s)]
*  and I didn't opine on things where I didn't feel like I had an expertise. So if you would ask me a [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=640.88s)]
*  question, and I didn't feel like I knew the answer, I would say, well, this is not my expertise, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=644.8s)]
*  these are the people who I would recommend I speak to to get perspective and let me bring you their, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=648.9599999999999s)]
*  their opinions. And so I think he saw me as somebody who was who was competent, obviously had [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=653.3599999999999s)]
*  his best interests at heart. Again, I wasn't accepting money for any of these jobs. So it [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=657.92s)]
*  wasn't doing it for financial gain. And I just started to really believe in a lot of the policies [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=661.92s)]
*  that he was pushing, and wanted to help him maybe translated from a campaign speech to kind of [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=666.88s)]
*  technical policy and then see once he got the opportunity to help him implement it as well. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=671.68s)]
*  That's really cool. Why did you agree to do Lex and why are you doing the show today? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=676.8s)]
*  We were kind of surprised to see you on Lex and obviously, like Lex said, it was a very different [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=680.4s)]
*  conversation than I think any of us would have expected having the only exposure to you being [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=687.52s)]
*  through, you know, some sort of media channels. What's motivating you to kind of do this today? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=692.8s)]
*  Before we get into it. So Lex, again, him, my wife, our friends, and I really follow and listen to [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=697.68s)]
*  what he does. I think in society today, the news is kind of just one person's, you know, point of [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=703.92s)]
*  view, and they're, they're, they're picking and choosing and editing what they put into it one [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=710.64s)]
*  way or the other. But the medium of the podcast is something that I my personal consumption was [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=715.52s)]
*  growing with. And I felt like it was a place where you could have real conversations. I think the [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=720.88s)]
*  people who are listening to podcasts are people who are looking to have a more nuanced perspective [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=725.2s)]
*  on something and really want to, you know, try to understand something deeper. And I respect Lex, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=730.72s)]
*  all my private conversations with him, I really enjoyed. And I love that he was really trying to [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=736.0s)]
*  find perspectives from people that maybe others didn't understand to try to bring greater [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=743.5200000000001s)]
*  understanding across. And so I agreed to do it after a while, I was really, really glad I did. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=749.92s)]
*  And based on the great feedback I got there, my sense is, is that the podcast format is something [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=755.8399999999999s)]
*  that's, you could have a real conversation, you can go back and forth, you could argue, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=762.0799999999999s)]
*  you could disagree. I think that that's where people really want to get their information from. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=766.0799999999999s)]
*  So I turned down a lot of, you know, cable news or different interview requests, because I find that [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=770.56s)]
*  you can't have as nuanced a discussion. And, you know, I wish things were as simple as, you know, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=775.76s)]
*  the black and white or the political slogans that people use. But the reality is things are a lot [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=780.0s)]
*  more nuanced. So when Shemoth reached out, I followed you guys, and I've listened to you for [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=784.16s)]
*  some time, I was, I was really happy to come do it. Awesome. Well, thanks for doing it. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=788.08s)]
*  Sax, you want to kick us off on the Gaza conflict and framing up the present day? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=793.2s)]
*  Sure. Based on what I've read, it seems like Israel has now formed a perimeter around [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=799.36s)]
*  Gaza City. They've sort of bisected Gaza between this north and south. And they've been trying to [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=805.92s)]
*  bomb entry or exit points from the Hamas tunnel network. And it seems like their strategy is to [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=812.72s)]
*  kind of gradually close in on that tunnel network and basically try and eliminate Hamas from sort [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=818.3199999999999s)]
*  of this northern part of Gaza, and then one assumes they'll move to the south. And I guess one other [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=826.88s)]
*  element to add to it is that, you know, while Israel is doing that, you're seeing protests, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=831.2s)]
*  both in the West and in the Arab or Muslim world, you're starting to see statements condemning [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=838.32s)]
*  Israel by leaders of these other countries in the region. I'd say the one by Turkey by Erdogan was [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=845.36s)]
*  notably harsh and threatening. But you're starting to see again, as Israel proceeds with this [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=852.1600000000001s)]
*  operation, you're starting to see more and more condemnation from various parts of the international [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=858.24s)]
*  community. So let's start with that is, you know, how do you assess what's happening on the ground? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=863.28s)]
*  What do you think the prospects for success are? And how do you assess the risk that this sort of [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=867.36s)]
*  escalates horizontally in ways that are kind of hard to predict and could spiral out of control? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=873.04s)]
*  Yeah, so there's a lot of different ways you can go with that. But I'll start with kind of the first [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=879.84s)]
*  question, which is in the immediate aftermath of the attack, my biggest concern was that Israel [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=884.08s)]
*  was clearly caught off guard from an intelligence and military perspective with the attack and the [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=891.5200000000001s)]
*  attacks were they shook a lot of people they were they were very, very heinous beyond [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=896.08s)]
*  really comprehension. It's crazy, the more and more stuff that comes out. And we were seeing a lot of [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=903.6s)]
*  in real time, thanks to the fact that right now with X and what what Elon's done there to, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=907.6s)]
*  to not try to censor things in the way that it was happening before. So we were all getting a [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=912.88s)]
*  lot of information real time. And it was really pulling at a lot of people's heartstrings. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=916.8000000000001s)]
*  My big fear initially was that Israel would react emotionally as opposed to to pragmatically. And I [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=920.8000000000001s)]
*  think that the steps that they've taken since then have been very wise. I think the fact that they [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=926.96s)]
*  took their time, and I've been very methodical about getting their supply lines ready about [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=932.08s)]
*  working how to garner as much international support. I mean, you have to remember these [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=937.2800000000001s)]
*  weren't just Israeli citizens that were killed. These were American citizens, they were German [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=941.52s)]
*  citizens, they were Thai citizens, they were UK citizens, and the hostages as well are not just [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=945.12s)]
*  Israeli citizens. So I think that Israel took its time to get the military operations set. I've seen [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=950.3199999999999s)]
*  them go slowly methodically. I mean, Gaza is a very, very complicated place. I mean, we studied [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=956.0s)]
*  it for four years, we were very closely watching all the different incursions we managed to Mos and [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=960.72s)]
*  their their malicious activities very, very closely to avoid situations like this. And the [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=966.4s)]
*  place is booby trapped like crazy. And so I do think the fact that the Israelis have taken their [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=972.8s)]
*  time and been very methodical, and have come up with a strategy has given me more hope. I mean, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=977.76s)]
*  every morning I wake up and I look to see, you know, praying there hasn't been more casualties [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=982.16s)]
*  in Israel and the hope is that they continue to do it in the best way possible. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=987.4399999999999s)]
*  So I think that the goal for them is really the elimination of Hamas. I think that, you know, the [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=991.92s)]
*  big point that I really want to make in the Lex podcast, which is why I went back to really do [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=998.24s)]
*  the point was that the people who are protesting in favor of the Palestinians, a lot of the [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1002.48s)]
*  Israelis and Palestinians want the same thing, which is they want security for Israel and a [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1009.8399999999999s)]
*  better life for the Palestinians. And I think what people have failed to really grasp for a long time [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1014.0799999999999s)]
*  is that Hamas has been the root cause of a lot of the bad lives for the Palestinians. If you think [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1019.04s)]
*  about Gaza, before this recent for October 7th, I mean, over half the population lived under the [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1024.6399999999999s)]
*  poverty line. You know, people were really trapped there and people would blame Israel for the [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1029.84s)]
*  blockade. But what's also happened over the last 30 days is a lot of the worst fears that we had [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1035.2s)]
*  during the administration or things that Israel would be saying have totally been proven true. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1039.76s)]
*  I mean, you've seen now, I'm going to some of these schoolhouses where there's, you know, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1043.76s)]
*  there's 500 or 50 different, you know, rocket launchers, you know, in the schoolhouses, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1047.44s)]
*  the hospitals, all the terrorists that they've captured that they're interrogating are saying, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1052.16s)]
*  well, that's where the military headquarters are, you know, now we're learning about this. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1055.76s)]
*  This tunnel network, which they're saying is hundreds of miles of tunnels underground. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1060.72s)]
*  Well, that's why, you know, Israel wasn't allowing cement and a lot of these materials [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1064.56s)]
*  in the cement that went in, which was supposed to build houses for the people of Gaza was then [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1068.56s)]
*  stolen by Hamas to build these tunnels. The pipes that went in to fix the water were then [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1073.2s)]
*  taken and turned into rockets. The fuel was stolen and not used for the hospitals or for [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1079.44s)]
*  people to have better lives. It was stolen for them to operate their tunnel network and then to [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1086.48s)]
*  fuel the rockets. So it's a situation that really does have to be dealt with. Again, Israel, you [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1090.4s)]
*  guys are, I know poker players. So Israel definitely has the stronger hand to play here. So I think [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1095.52s)]
*  time is on the one hand in their favor, but on the other hand, obviously, you know, the international [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1101.28s)]
*  community has historically been very anti-Israel and anti-Semitic in the way that they've [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1106.8s)]
*  approached a lot of these skirmishes to date. But I will say, I think there's been more [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1112.24s)]
*  international support for Israel this time than I've ever seen. And I do think that that's a very [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1116.72s)]
*  important thing. So that's maybe general, if there were some of the specific questions that you want [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1122.16s)]
*  to get to in there, I can- What about the risk of horizontal escalation? Let's just talk about that [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1126.32s)]
*  for a second, because you do hear, I think, a growing chorus of countries who are denouncing [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1129.92s)]
*  Israel. They're saying that this is collective punishment, that the bombing of Gaza is [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1136.48s)]
*  indiscriminate. They want it to stop. There's- Genocide. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1142.4s)]
*  Genocide. Yeah. I'm not saying I agree with that rhetoric, but you do hear it. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1146.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, there's an effort at the UN to pass a ceasefire resolution. So there's a lot of people [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1150.8000000000002s)]
*  who want the ceasefire, and there's a lot of growing international pressure for that. And [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1155.92s)]
*  then you've heard threats from, you know, again, Erdogan and Turkey that if there's not a ceasefire, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1160.88s)]
*  at some point, they're going to have to get involved. They're going to have to act. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1165.68s)]
*  Iran has said similar kinds of things, although I think it's pretty clear they don't want to get [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1168.16s)]
*  involved. They don't want this to escalate into a wider regional war. But they've sort of intimated [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1173.52s)]
*  that if the bombing continues, that they might have to take action. They might feel pressure to [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1178.3200000000002s)]
*  do that. So I guess one question there is, is time on Israel's side? It does seem like, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1183.28s)]
*  again, there's more pressure to stop the military operation over time, as opposed to less. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1190.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So the answer is, is everyone's talking their book, and that's what they should be doing. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1196.32s)]
*  They're talking to their populations. The question is what people will actually do. I would say that, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1200.96s)]
*  you know, the hardest thing for us all is obviously you see civilians in Gaza who are being [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1205.68s)]
*  used as human shields. And the last thing that anyone wants is for more civilian deaths to occur. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1209.68s)]
*  It's funny, this morning I was speaking to a friend in Israel who was telling me that yesterday [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1215.04s)]
*  there was a major evacuation of civilians in Gaza. And a lot of people were surprised that the [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1219.04s)]
*  Israeli Defense Forces were basically putting themselves in between the Hamas militants and the [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1226.0s)]
*  Gazan civilians to protect them and open up a corridor. And again, one thing that Israel's done, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1231.1200000000001s)]
*  I think, a good job of is getting out a lot of the facts about how they've been warning the [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1235.76s)]
*  Gazan civilians to flee, asking them to go. And what happened was Hamas was shooting them down [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1240.4s)]
*  with snipers and trying to prevent them from going because they wanted them to stay in place [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1245.76s)]
*  as human shields in the schools and the hospitals where they were conducting their terror activities. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1250.0s)]
*  And so what was interesting to me was, my friend was telling me, speaking to a friend of his who [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1254.96s)]
*  was a soldier, was that a lot of the civilians are really thanking them for liberating them from [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1259.92s)]
*  Hamas and for risking their lives to help them get out of Gaza. And a lot of these people, again, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1266.8000000000002s)]
*  they've been prisoners to Hamas more than anything else for a long time and they want to see themselves [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1271.2s)]
*  out of there so that they can perhaps have a better opportunity to live a better life. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1277.04s)]
*  And so I think that the current region, I think the biggest immediate threat is from Hezbollah [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1281.04s)]
*  the north. I think that's been, I think Israel going to full ready alert was a really smart [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1287.36s)]
*  thing. I think the US moving the battle carriers there, I think was also good. I think the [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1292.6399999999999s)]
*  statements from the US administration were strong upfront. Again, whether people believe that they'll [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1298.1599999999999s)]
*  back up those statements is another thing because they do have a little bit of a credibility deficit [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1304.6399999999999s)]
*  in the region based on what they've done over the last couple of years. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1308.8799999999999s)]
*  But I think that's all been very helpful in kind of pushing Iran back and sending a strong message [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1312.56s)]
*  to Hezbollah, which is if you want to attack Israel, don't do it when they're at full military [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1319.76s)]
*  readiness. Israel's a nuclear power. And I think everyone is starting to realize that this has been [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1323.9199999999998s)]
*  Iran trying to manipulate things. And as long as they think there's a threat that you're not going [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1329.04s)]
*  to go after one of their proxies, but you may go after them, that's been the best way of keeping [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1333.4399999999998s)]
*  de-escalation. I think with Turkey and others, I've spent many hours with Erdogan personally [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1337.76s)]
*  talking about Gaza. And I know that he has a big heart for the Palestinian people. He hates [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1342.88s)]
*  to see their suffering and it's also good politics from him. He's also from a Muslim Brotherhood [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1348.0s)]
*  leading party. But I think in his heart of heart, he does have to acknowledge that a lot of their [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1354.24s)]
*  plight is led to by bad governance. He may not want to admit it publicly, but the reality is, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1359.04s)]
*  is the best way to improve the lives of the people of Gaza is to eliminate Hamas and put in [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1364.56s)]
*  place a structure where people can finally have the opportunity to live more freely and make better [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1369.9199999999998s)]
*  lives for themselves. Jared, you said something that I think is really interesting. You said [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1376.48s)]
*  Erdogan has a soft spot for the Palestinians. Can I just take that concept and just, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1379.9199999999998s)]
*  can you explain the historical context of Arabs, the Arab world and their relationship with the [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1384.3999999999999s)]
*  Palestinians? Because it's definitely had its ebbs and flows over the arc of history. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1390.88s)]
*  And so, how do people think about it, just broadly speaking, just in terms of the big [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1396.0800000000002s)]
*  historical arcs that have shaped this relationship between Arabs and Palestinians specifically? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1401.44s)]
*  Well, that's a question we could spend about three days talking about, but I'll try to give [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1407.68s)]
*  you a very quick version of it. So, I think that a lot of this goes back really to, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1411.2800000000002s)]
*  uh, people say it goes back to a lot of times, but I think that we have to probably go back to, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1417.1200000000001s)]
*  and I'll try to do this very quick, is really 1948, which was a complicated time. It's post-Hawkeye [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1423.1200000000001s)]
*  cost, post-World War II. You know, again, the Middle East really in the early 1900s was a lot [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1428.24s)]
*  of, was created by a lot of arbitrary lines drawn by foreigners. And you had a situation where Israel [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1434.08s)]
*  is, the UN puts forth the partition plan, Israel, they're willing to recognize Israel [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1440.32s)]
*  as a state for the Jewish people. And also give a state to the Palestinians. The Arabs reject [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1445.44s)]
*  that and attack Israel. There's a whole war during that war. It was flared up really by [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1450.96s)]
*  General Nasser from Egypt, who at the time was the leader of the Muslim world. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1455.92s)]
*  During that war, Israel was able to defy the odds and win. And a lot of Palestinians were either [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1459.76s)]
*  forced from their homes or displaced from their homes. You know, there's versions where they say [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1465.28s)]
*  the Arabs said, leave your homes. And then, you know, when the war is over, you're going to come [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1468.56s)]
*  back and take everything. Some Arabs stayed in their homes and actually today they're Israeli [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1472.16s)]
*  citizens with full, you know, equal rights as other Israelis. And so that happened. Then in 1967, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1476.96s)]
*  that's when Egypt attacked again. And during that war, again, Israel miraculously won. And that was [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1484.88s)]
*  really kind of the time where Israel was able to expand their territory. They took over the West [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1491.68s)]
*  Bank at the time, which wasn't, didn't belong to the Palestinians as much as it belonged to Jordan. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1497.1200000000001s)]
*  It was part of trans Jordan at the time. And then they also gained control of the Gaza Strip, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1500.8s)]
*  which also was previously administered by Egypt. Although when Egypt was administering it, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1505.36s)]
*  they didn't take it as their territory. They never granted citizenship to the people who were there. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1510.8s)]
*  So between 1948 and 1967, when the Six Day War occurred, most of the leaders in the Arab world [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1514.8s)]
*  enjoyed leaving this issue out. It was a great way to stoke nationalism and to, it was a very [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1522.08s)]
*  easy political issue for them to have to say, well, we need to do this and, you know, to, to, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1527.52s)]
*  to fight for the Palestinian people. So in a lot of ways, it was a way to deflect their shortcomings [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1531.52s)]
*  at home and to justify certain actions they were taking because they were fighting for this, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1535.6s)]
*  this group of people. Then it gets really interesting after the Six Day War. So this was [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1540.32s)]
*  the second time that the Arab countries had failed to, to destroy Israel, which is what they had [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1544.32s)]
*  promised they would do. So there's a young terrorist at the time named Yasser Arafat, and he was part [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1550.08s)]
*  of a party called Fatah. And what he said is, you know what, all these Arab leaders, they're lying [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1554.88s)]
*  to you, they're failing you. I'm going to be the one to start creating a liberation and opportunity [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1559.8400000000001s)]
*  for the Palestinian people. So he took on this mantle, was able to use his Fatah group and some [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1564.16s)]
*  pretty thuggery ways to take over the Palestinian Liberation Organization, which was a way that he [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1569.0400000000002s)]
*  got some international acclaim. And at the time he was doing that from Jordan. So this is about 1968, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1573.8400000000001s)]
*  1969. They caused so much trouble in Jordan that King Hussein at the time, who's King Abdullah's [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1579.28s)]
*  father, who really was a very, very special diplomat and leader in the Middle East, got so fed up with [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1585.68s)]
*  Arafat. I mean, at the time he was causing trouble, it was steering people away and people [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1592.96s)]
*  wouldn't invest there. They wouldn't, it was hurting terrorism. And then they took it a little [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1597.04s)]
*  further and they tried to assassinate him, which was probably the final straw. So the Jordanian [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1601.44s)]
*  leader said, get these people the hell out of my country. It was a big clash between the PLO [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1605.68s)]
*  and Fatah terrorists and then the Jordanian police and military. And they were able to expel them. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1612.72s)]
*  And then the Palestinians went to Lebanon. That's where Yasser Arafat was. So they were there for [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1618.96s)]
*  about 12 years. Again, they went back to their old ways of fermenting radicalism and finding ways to [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1623.1200000000001s)]
*  cause trouble. When Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, then Yasser Arafat fled again, this time to [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1630.48s)]
*  Tunisia. In Tunisia, they were living pretty well as a beachfront place. They're in these beautiful [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1637.3600000000001s)]
*  villas on the beach and they kind of became a little bit disconnected from the Palestinian people. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1642.48s)]
*  But there was a lot of resentment of the broader Arab world because they felt like, again, the Arab [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1647.1200000000001s)]
*  world didn't really, they would say they were for the Palestinian people, but never really stood up [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1652.96s)]
*  for them in the way that they felt like they deserved. So it took until about 1988 that [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1656.8s)]
*  finally, this is 40 years after 1948, the war of independence, where the PLO was finally able to [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1663.12s)]
*  get the Arab League to say, and this was really because Jordan was just done with this issue, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1669.84s)]
*  to say, okay, we're going to acknowledge that this land here should become a Palestinian state. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1674.6399999999999s)]
*  So the notion of a Palestinian state really didn't emerge until about 1987, 1988, which the same time [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1678.3999999999999s)]
*  that Hamas actually came about. And they came about really from, they were in offshoot of the [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1685.04s)]
*  Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. And their whole thing was basically, we're going to do full terrorism in [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1689.76s)]
*  order to prevent any compromise or any deals with Israel. So then you go to 1991, which is a very, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1695.36s)]
*  very important time for the Palestinians, mostly because Saddam Hussein in Iraq invades Kuwait. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1702.1599999999999s)]
*  And that was very scary for a lot of the Arab leaders. They didn't want, they did fear Saddam. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1709.52s)]
*  He was seen as the radical. Arafat and the Palestinian leadership, Ba'ath Saddam Hussein, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1714.16s)]
*  mostly because they knew that he was seen as the revolutionary and popular with the more common man. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1720.48s)]
*  And this pissed off every single Gulf leader because they basically said, wait, this guy, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1725.8400000000001s)]
*  if he's going to take over Kuwait, he could come for Saudi Arabia, he'd come for UAE. So [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1729.28s)]
*  they were all very against that. And at the time, there's about over 200,000 Palestinians in Kuwait. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1733.2s)]
*  What happened at that time, though, was that that made the Palestinian leadership so weak, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1738.0800000000002s)]
*  because a lot of the Arab countries cut off the funding, it was just done with them. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1742.64s)]
*  And that's really what led to the Oslo Accords. So the Oslo Accords happened, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1746.24s)]
*  not because Arafat necessarily, all of a sudden said, after 37 or 27 years of trying terror and [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1749.68s)]
*  pushing forward, he basically ran out of other options. And this was his only way to get some [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1757.6000000000001s)]
*  form of legitimacy. So they dropped from their charter, the whole notion of destroying Israel, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1762.0s)]
*  and said, let's try to create this area where we can have governance and try this whole [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1766.3200000000002s)]
*  effort for Palestinian states. So that's really kind of a long short version of kind of how we [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1770.08s)]
*  got to then. And then in the last, I'd say 30 years, the big change that I would say between [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1775.6799999999998s)]
*  then and today is that you have a lot, you have a new Middle East forming. And a lot of the work [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1781.36s)]
*  we did in the Trump administration was really to help what I'd call the new Middle East emerge, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1786.08s)]
*  where you have a lot of economic opportunities now happening in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1790.56s)]
*  There's been a massive mind shift where if you go kind of post Arab Spring, a lot of these leaders [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1796.72s)]
*  are saying, you know, how do we create opportunity for our people? When I got into my job in 2017, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1801.76s)]
*  all the experts were saying to me, the big divide in the Middle East is between the Sunnis and the [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1807.76s)]
*  Shias. And when I got there, I said, no, no, no, the divide is between leaders who want to give [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1812.9599999999998s)]
*  opportunity and betterment of life to their people and people who want to use religion or [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1817.36s)]
*  or whatever issue they want to hold on to from the past in order to deflect from their shortcomings [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1823.04s)]
*  and justify bad leadership. So I think what's happened today is you have a lot of the Gulf [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1827.9199999999998s)]
*  countries really wanting to see this issue get resolved, which is different than you had in [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1832.48s)]
*  Camp David in 2000, when Bill Clinton was getting close to a deal with Yasser Arafat. I think the [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1837.52s)]
*  Saudis and others at the time didn't want this issue to go away. But now the issue is really no [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1842.72s)]
*  longer useful for the Arabs. The only people it's useful to, quite frankly, is Iran. And that's why [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1847.28s)]
*  they've been backing Hamas and Hezbollah and all these other factions in order to continue their [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1851.84s)]
*  project of instability. So the way I view this period right now is that the Middle East today [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1856.6399999999999s)]
*  is way stronger than it's been in the past. And this is what I would say the last gasp of Iran [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1862.56s)]
*  and those who have pushed for destabilization and this whole Islamist jihadist project at the [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1868.56s)]
*  expense of a collaborative Middle East, which then will create a lot of opportunity for the [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1875.4399999999998s)]
*  next generation to really thrive. Jared, isn't there like, at this point then, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1880.72s)]
*  is it hard or easy to create an objective target? We call individuals that Israel wants to [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1888.64s)]
*  target Hamas, but there's no card carrying members of Hamas. You don't wear a jacket that says, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1896.64s)]
*  I'm a member of Hamas and walk around with an ID card. And there are some folks who are sympathetic [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1901.44s)]
*  who believe that Hamas represents a resistance movement. There are some folks who obviously feel [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1907.76s)]
*  terrorized and ruled over. And there are some folks who support the cause, but don't pull the [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1914.8s)]
*  trigger. There are some folks who pull the trigger, but don't want to support the cause, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1922.96s)]
*  but are being forced to by some reports. How easy and how hard is it to really direct a military [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1926.16s)]
*  operation at such a fluid population that it's very hard to ID and target. And as we've seen [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1933.36s)]
*  in years past, there's always another group that seems to emerge. You cut off one group, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1943.28s)]
*  you get rid of Al-Qaeda, ISIS emerges, and there's this almost like, you know, fluid transition [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1949.6s)]
*  of this intention. And particularly in this Gaza community, it's very difficult perhaps to [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1957.36s)]
*  distinguish between who's Hamas and who's not Hamas. So how do you actually achieve the objective [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1962.64s)]
*  there? And, you know, how does the military target? Yeah, so that's probably the most important [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1967.76s)]
*  question that I think people have to really be thinking about as we kind of enter this phase, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1974.24s)]
*  right? So it's both how do you do this in the short term and then the long term. And so you [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1980.48s)]
*  can't kill your way out of an ideology, but there obviously are some bad leaders at the top who are [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1985.8400000000001s)]
*  culpable, who are military targets. And I imagine that it's really, you know, knowing the capabilities [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1990.4s)]
*  of Israel and the Mossad, it's just a matter of, you know, when and how as opposed to anything else. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=1996.5600000000002s)]
*  But then you have a lot of mid-level and younger members of this group. And I do think that a lot [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2001.2800000000002s)]
*  of these people are in this situation more circumstantially. I think this is what they've [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2006.5600000000002s)]
*  been taught to believe. I think this is really the place they were. And this was the system in Gaza, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2010.0s)]
*  where if you wanted to advance and live a better life, then you really had to succumb to this [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2015.2s)]
*  tiered system. So how deep the ideology is, people will debate that in different ways. If you go back [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2019.2s)]
*  to 2016, the campaign when we were dealing with ISIS, the talking point that everyone used was [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2024.64s)]
*  you have to defeat the territorial caliphate of ISIS, and then you have to win the long-term [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2030.48s)]
*  battle against extremism. One of the things that President Trump did when he went to Saudi Arabia [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2034.3200000000002s)]
*  in 2017, the reason we went there was that the Middle East was basically on fire. I mean, if you [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2038.88s)]
*  had ISIS had a caliphate the size of Ohio, they were ruling over 8 million people, they were [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2043.68s)]
*  beheading journalists and killing Christians. Syria was in a civil war where 500,000 people were [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2048.32s)]
*  killed, a lot of Muslims, and you didn't see the same protests on college campuses when that was [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2055.36s)]
*  happening as Assad was gassing his own people. Libya was destabilized, Yemen was destabilized, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2058.7200000000003s)]
*  and Iran was on a glide path to a nuclear weapon, having just been given $150 billion in cash through [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2065.1200000000003s)]
*  the disastrous JCPOA deal that Kerry and Obama negotiated. So it was a mess. And so Trump went [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2070.32s)]
*  there and basically was pretty tough with what he said. And he said, this isn't our problem, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2078.0s)]
*  this isn't your problem, this is all of our problem, and we need to root this ideology, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2083.52s)]
*  get it out of your homes, get it out of your mosques, get it out of this earth. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2087.36s)]
*  And the King of Saudi Arabia stood up at the time and said, there's no glory in death, and that was [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2091.2s)]
*  really important. Two of the big deals that came out of that, people talk about the big investments, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2095.28s)]
*  did over $500 billion of investments in arms sales with Saudi Arabia that created a lot of US jobs. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2100.48s)]
*  But the two agreements we made that didn't get a lot of coverage during that time was that we did a [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2106.72s)]
*  counter-terror finance center that we set up, where we got all the Gulf countries to really [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2111.04s)]
*  allow Treasury to work closely with their banks to stop a lot of the funding to the terrorist [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2115.12s)]
*  organizations and then these kind of borderline organizations. And the second one was in Saudi [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2118.7999999999997s)]
*  Arabia, which is the custodian of the two holy sites in Islam Mecca, Medina, they started a [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2123.52s)]
*  counter-extremism center where basically they were combating online radicalization that was [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2128.8799999999997s)]
*  occurring. And if you remember the US in 2016, we had the San Bernardino shooting, we had the [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2135.04s)]
*  Pulse nightclub shooting and a lot of people being radicalized online. One of the things that I'm [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2139.52s)]
*  very proud of from the Trump administration is the work that we did to really help Saudi Arabia [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2144.8s)]
*  change their trajectory. And what I realized quickly was that in the US, we just did not have [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2149.68s)]
*  the capabilities to win the long-term ideological battle ourselves. So we can be mad at Saudi for [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2154.0s)]
*  some of the things that they've done in the past, but they were the most powerful partner we could [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2159.52s)]
*  have in order to try to combat the radicalization that was occurring, both in terms of stopping the [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2163.76s)]
*  funding, but also replacing the clerics who were doing the radicalization with the clerics who were [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2170.0800000000004s)]
*  restoring Islam to a more peaceful and more proper place. So that was something that's really [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2176.2400000000002s)]
*  current. It's made a big difference. I was just in Saudi Arabia a couple of weeks ago at their big [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2182.2400000000002s)]
*  investment conference. And what was really exciting to me was I was meeting with a lot of the [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2185.36s)]
*  younger Saudi entrepreneurs. And I did a conference in Bahrain to talk about the Palestinians [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2189.6s)]
*  in 2019. And one of the big challenges we had when we were putting that together is we were thinking [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2195.44s)]
*  about who are the role models for these young Palestinian kids. And in the Muslim world, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2200.48s)]
*  they had some sports stars, they had some business leaders, but it wasn't really people who were [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2205.7599999999998s)]
*  necessarily relatable to a lot of the younger generation. In Saudi, I was at an event with all [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2210.7999999999997s)]
*  these young tech entrepreneurs there who are building amazing companies, a lot of unicorns [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2215.6s)]
*  there. They're doing a lot of the companies that are dominant in the US and in Asia. And now they're [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2220.08s)]
*  building them for the Middle East there. And it's very, very exciting. And these really are the next [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2225.52s)]
*  generation of role models for a lot of these kids. So that's a long way of saying that, obviously, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2229.36s)]
*  you have to do what you have to do from a military perspective. And the hope obviously is that it [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2234.88s)]
*  could be as quick as possible and that as few civilians as possible are hurt by this. But [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2239.52s)]
*  the notion is that once that's completed, you need to then create a framework where people don't just [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2245.92s)]
*  have more despair. Because in an area where there's no hope and opportunity, then obviously the [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2250.88s)]
*  radicalists and the jihadists, that's really where they do their best recruiting and they flourish. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2256.48s)]
*  So once this occurs, there needs to be a paradigm created where the next generation feels like it's [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2260.48s)]
*  better for them to get a job, be part of the economy, and where they can live a better life [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2266.32s)]
*  through capitalism than by going to these jihadist groups. But it's leadership targeting right now. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2270.2400000000002s)]
*  That's the objective, effectively. I mean, that's what I'm hearing. I think it's leadership and then [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2276.56s)]
*  degrading of capabilities. Because again, what you've seen as well, you've seen this with cartels [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2281.28s)]
*  in South America and you've seen this with terror organizations. You kill the top guy and sometimes [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2286.56s)]
*  you cut the head off the snake and the snake dies. And sometimes it just scatters into a lot [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2291.44s)]
*  of little pieces and then it ends up becoming more complicated, not less. But I think here, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2295.44s)]
*  obviously leadership, but significantly degrading the capabilities for anything in Gaza to threaten [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2299.6s)]
*  Israel. And then actively build a better way, actively build a better solution. That's the [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2308.32s)]
*  only way. And by the way, even today, it's much more easy to visualize that than it was in 2019 [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2313.84s)]
*  when I was talking about this, because you're seeing the economic project in Saudi Arabia, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2318.96s)]
*  you're seeing what they're doing in UAE. I mean, the fact that Saudi shifted so much in five years [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2322.64s)]
*  should give you hope that it's really, really possible. And they've been pushing the rest of [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2327.2s)]
*  the countries to try to emulate and compete with them, which is also an amazing thing. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2330.56s)]
*  Aaron Powell I'd love to get your reaction to the difference in tone and messaging from [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2335.04s)]
*  Western governments versus what you're seeing sometimes on the ground with some of these [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2339.92s)]
*  protests and just how almost diametrically opposed the language and the rhetoric and the point of [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2344.16s)]
*  view is how is it that and sort of this is why I kind of asked you just for a little bit of a [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2350.0s)]
*  history. How is it that people aren't taking all of these views in? How is it that there is this [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2355.36s)]
*  radicalization that may not be happening in the same level in the Middle East, but is maybe [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2362.0s)]
*  happening actually in the West, whether it's in our universities or other ones? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2368.32s)]
*  Michael O'Brien Yeah, so that's something like my friends in the Middle East, a lot of them are [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2372.96s)]
*  laughing at the West because they're basically saying, you know, we got all these Islamist, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2376.88s)]
*  radical Muslim brotherate people the hell out of our countries. You don't see the same protests [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2381.44s)]
*  in those places that you see in the West. And I think that in the West, what's occurred is people, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2385.92s)]
*  I saw this a lot when I dealt with the Europeans where people's understanding of the issue is more [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2393.28s)]
*  with their heart than it is with their head. And obviously nobody wants to see any suffering [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2397.92s)]
*  of any human beings. But the reality is, is that, you know, the solutions that they've proposed for [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2402.32s)]
*  the last 75 years have all been just nonsensical. They've more often than not perpetuated the [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2407.52s)]
*  problem than they've been solutions to the problem. And, you know, I faced tons of criticism when I [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2412.6400000000003s)]
*  was, you know, in my role working on this issue, and mostly because I kind of looked at all the [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2417.1200000000003s)]
*  things that have been done in the past and keep my being asked to work on, you know, the Middle East, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2421.6800000000003s)]
*  it's like, it's almost like a joke, right? It's the hardest problem set you can get in the world. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2425.84s)]
*  And I think we almost made it look too easy getting the results that we did. And we left it [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2430.16s)]
*  very quiet. And I think now people are starting to appreciate that it wasn't that easy. And it's not [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2434.8799999999997s)]
*  a simple problem set to deal with. But I think that a lot of people were kind of looking at [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2441.3599999999997s)]
*  what they thought was wrong, but looking at the wrong root causes for how it got there. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2451.04s)]
*  Mm hmm. I have a question for you and Sachs. I'd love to get your guys opinion on this. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2455.04s)]
*  India dealt with a terrorist attack when Manmohan Singh was Prime Minister. And basically it was an [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2460.7999999999997s)]
*  extremist Muslim group from Pakistan, Lakshari Taiba, that came in and killed a lot of Indians, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2466.88s)]
*  but a lot of foreigners as well, right? Attacked some of the major hotels in Bombay, etc. And [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2472.24s)]
*  what happened was Manmohan Singh didn't do anything. And in hindsight, what was written is, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2477.68s)]
*  you know, they debated what to do. They debated, do we go after this group? Do we show some [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2484.48s)]
*  proactive demonstration of force? Do we invade Pakistan? Ultimately, they went on a more covert [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2492.16s)]
*  path to sort of dismantle that terror network. And there was just a lot of international support [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2499.04s)]
*  that came around it. Can we steel man whether it would have been possible for Netanyahu to take [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2503.28s)]
*  that path? Or was it really not even reasonable? Just curious what you guys think about that. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2510.1600000000003s)]
*  Do you want to go first? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2518.48s)]
*  No, you should go first, Eric. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2521.1200000000003s)]
*  Okay. So look, anything's possible, Chamath. And I think that there's different ways. Look, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2522.4s)]
*  I think the big fears initially were that going into Gaza, number one, you'd be walking into a [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2529.6s)]
*  big trap. And number two is you would be inviting major escalation in the region. The third fear was [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2536.16s)]
*  obviously the degradation of the Israeli economy. When we did the Abraham Accords, one of the big [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2541.6s)]
*  attractive things to a lot of these countries to be partners with Israel was their massively [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2548.0s)]
*  robust economy. And what could happen if they go to war, and it's a prolonged war is that economy [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2552.56s)]
*  can go off track. I think GDP will take a big hit there in Q4. But obviously, in Israel, they do [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2557.2s)]
*  have a history of coming back right away. But if this is a prolonged war effort, there could be big [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2562.3999999999996s)]
*  hits. And then you also think about the age of AI and software development losing, a day of [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2567.6s)]
*  productivity is the equivalent of losing a week or a month. And they don't want to fall behind in [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2572.0s)]
*  what they're doing. So there is an argument to be made for doing that. But I do think that from [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2577.12s)]
*  Israel's perspective, I do think that they understand this threat. I think that they want [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2581.44s)]
*  to eliminate this threat. And I think their view is, is we can't live like this anymore. We [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2587.28s)]
*  underestimated it before. And we will not let that happen again. And I think also the psychology of [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2592.96s)]
*  really the Jewish people is, you know, it's funny, once I was sitting with Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2598.08s)]
*  and one of the generals and, and Bibi was basically saying, like, you know, if Iran gets too close, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2603.28s)]
*  this is what I'm going to do, we're gonna have to take matters to our hands. And the general [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2608.32s)]
*  basically said to me said, you know, I get it, you know, you guys aren't going back to the ovens. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2611.28s)]
*  And I was just like, wow, you know, so it was a real acknowledgement of like the way that Israel [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2614.56s)]
*  operates with kind of no margin for error. And I would always say when I'm negotiating with the [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2619.52s)]
*  Israelis that, you know, sometimes you do a contract and there's like, you know, there's, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2622.8s)]
*  there's two issues that are a 10 and like a couple issues that are five and like a whole bunch, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2626.2400000000002s)]
*  you know, whole bag of issues that are like twos and threes. And when I would negotiate with [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2629.44s)]
*  the Israelis, like, they would treat every issue like it was like a 10, you know, I mean, in the [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2632.88s)]
*  sense that like they just operate like there's no margin for error. And, and I do think that [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2637.52s)]
*  obviously there was some complacency and the internal division, you know, led to them being [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2643.52s)]
*  caught off guard here. But I think that they're going to do what they're going to do to make sure [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2647.7599999999998s)]
*  this this happens. And I think there's also a way where Israel feels mentally like we have to show [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2651.84s)]
*  that we're strong or else people will go after us. And I think that that's what they've done. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2656.64s)]
*  And I will say, you know, the fact that Israel has gone from being completely divided to now [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2660.64s)]
*  fully united in this effort, I mean, even the people on the far left in Israel who are all [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2665.2799999999997s)]
*  peace who are, you know, funding, you know, jobs with Palestinians and, you know, housing them in [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2670.16s)]
*  their homes. I mean, they're basically saying they want to go to war. So the mentality there is very [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2674.3199999999997s)]
*  much, we need to do what we need to do now to keep ourselves safe. People are very, very [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2677.7599999999998s)]
*  heartbroken for those who are who are past them. They're, they're, they're praying very closely [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2682.56s)]
*  for the hostages. And, but they've given a lot of latitude to their government to do what it needs [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2686.16s)]
*  to do to make sure this this is this is not this does not occur again. And I will say to like, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2691.52s)]
*  Israel also recognizes that I think now they have the world more on their side than they have in in [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2696.88s)]
*  past conflicts. And I think their view is to their view is to do it while they have that situation. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2702.8s)]
*  Sacks, what do you think? Could Netanyahu have taken the path of doing nothing? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2709.7599999999998s)]
*  No, I don't think so. I mean, not given his domestic political situation. I think the [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2716.48s)]
*  Israeli people demand a response. And look, one of the arguments that Israel would make is that, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2722.0s)]
*  if this happened to you, the United States, or you Russia, or you China, what would you do? [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2729.28s)]
*  I mean, I think we know we would turn Gaza into Fallujah, or Mosul, Russia would turn into [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2734.16s)]
*  Grozny. So I think Israel is taking the response that I think most countries would take, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2740.48s)]
*  given their situation. The thing I worry about is that Israel is not the United States. I mean, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2749.12s)]
*  the United States, because it's so powerful, can act largely with impunity. We don't have to worry [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2754.0s)]
*  as much about blowback. And Israel does, because at the end of the day, they're a small country in a [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2759.04s)]
*  very hostile region. And so I do worry about the potential for unintended consequences here. One [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2763.36s)]
*  potential consequence is horizontal escalation. Does this war somehow spin out of control? And [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2769.28s)]
*  it could lead to a much wider regional war that would not be in Israel's interest. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2774.0800000000004s)]
*  The other is diplomatic isolation, because I do think that Israel is taking a big hit right now [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2777.84s)]
*  on the information war, the war of republic opinion. And then finally, you do have a lot [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2782.5600000000004s)]
*  of civilian casualties, and those civilians have brothers and sisters and cousins and so forth. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2786.5600000000004s)]
*  And that's going to lead to the next generation of terrorists. And so even success in this operation [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2791.36s)]
*  against Hamas doesn't solve the long-term problem. I mean, it just kind of keeps it going. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2797.44s)]
*  So I think all of those things are potential problems. But at the end of the day, if Israel [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2801.76s)]
*  can have a successful military operation here that significantly degrades or destroys Hamas [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2810.0s)]
*  without this thing spiraling out of control that buys them time to find a political solution, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2816.16s)]
*  then maybe it will be worthwhile. I mean, I think a lot depends here on what the outcome [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2823.2000000000003s)]
*  ultimately is. I think it's like a very tough thing to judge without knowing what the outcome [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2826.8s)]
*  is going to be. The King of Jordan a couple of weeks ago gave a speech. And in the speech, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2830.6400000000003s)]
*  he said, there is no peace possible in the Middle East without the emergence of a Palestinian state, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2838.1600000000003s)]
*  with a two-state solution being the only path forward. A Palestinian independent and sovereign [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2843.76s)]
*  state should be on June 4, 1967 lines, with East Jerusalem as its capital. And so that the cycles [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2848.6400000000003s)]
*  of killing whose ultimate victims are innocent civilians end. Is this the only path to [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2856.16s)]
*  stabilization, Jared? And is that where we're headed? [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2864.8799999999997s)]
*  So that statement is the same throwaway statement, right? That's the safest statement for anyone to [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2869.44s)]
*  say because that became the international consensus. So one thing that was super [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2874.0s)]
*  interesting to me when I was working on this was I kind of said to my team once I was like, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2878.56s)]
*  where does the Palestinian claim for East Jerusalem as the capital come from? [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2883.28s)]
*  And I had a guy on my team who was a military guy who actually worked for John Kerry. And I'd [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2886.96s)]
*  always have him in the room because he would represent the Palestinian perspective. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2890.96s)]
*  He made a bunch of Orthodox Jews and we tried to be impartial, but we did the best we could to have [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2894.48s)]
*  all perspectives represented. And he came, I actually don't know. And then what's interesting [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2900.0800000000004s)]
*  is when the West Bank was actually governed by Jordan, the capital at the time was Amman. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2906.48s)]
*  And so it really wasn't till the 1988 launch of this right for a Palestinian state that they [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2914.16s)]
*  self-declared that the capital should be East Jerusalem. And so that was actually an interesting [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2921.76s)]
*  notion as well. And I think that everyone knows that that's not going to be the case. And I asked [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2925.68s)]
*  one of the leaders once why they say that. And they said, well, it's a cliche. And I said, well, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2930.08s)]
*  maybe we need a new cliche. And he says, yeah, that's a good idea. Let's come up with a new cliche. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2933.52s)]
*  So I think whatever solution is going to occur has to be pragmatic. The reality is that if we're [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2937.28s)]
*  going to learn from Gaza, there's a couple of lessons to learn. Number one is Israel withdrew [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2944.64s)]
*  from Gaza in 2005 or 2006. They forcibly removed 50,000 Israeli settlers from Gaza. All those [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2950.48s)]
*  people, they left their homes, they left their businesses thinking that would be peace. They [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2959.04s)]
*  transferred governance of Gaza to the Palestinians. The Palestinians then had an election. Again, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2963.7599999999998s)]
*  it was the PA at the time convinced the Bush administration to allow for Hamas, even though [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2969.2s)]
*  their charter called for the destruction of Israel, to participate in the election. And they won in a [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2975.04s)]
*  democratic election. Since that time, there's been no improvement in the economy. It's become a real [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2979.6s)]
*  security risk for Israel. And so Israel withdrew and then let them govern themselves. And now you [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2985.52s)]
*  have what's happened today be the case. So I think the reality is that if you look at the historical [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2991.28s)]
*  maps and the historical lines, there's really no making a claim. There's no other example in [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=2998.88s)]
*  history where somebody's lost three offensive wars and then has been able to maintain their claim over [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3006.0s)]
*  a territory that they had before. But I do think that there is an international consensus. And I do [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3010.72s)]
*  even think in Israel, there's consensus to give the Palestinian people the ability to kind of have [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3016.3999999999996s)]
*  their own land and then also to govern themselves. So the word state is a very loaded term because it [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3021.52s)]
*  comes with a lot of definitions to different people. But I think the constructs of what's achievable is [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3027.7599999999998s)]
*  in the West Bank or Gaza, there can be no security threat to Israel. This is something that they were [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3034.3199999999997s)]
*  insistent on before and I was sympathetic. This was even before October 7th. And if you go back [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3040.32s)]
*  and look at the work we did and what we put out, we had a security regime that we designed with [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3044.6400000000003s)]
*  US intelligence and military and Israeli intelligence and Israeli military that we [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3048.7200000000003s)]
*  thought actually gave a lot of autonomy from a police force perspective to the Palestinians [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3053.44s)]
*  allowed them to build their capabilities and they kind of like earned their way into more and more [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3057.84s)]
*  security control, which I thought was the right way to do that because you don't want to take a [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3062.2400000000002s)]
*  ton of risk there. The other part of it though in any state is you need a functioning [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3065.36s)]
*  economy. Otherwise, obviously you have a big grievance party. The biggest problem the Palestinians [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3070.0s)]
*  have faced over the last 25 years since Oslo, I guess almost 30 years now since Oslo, is just bad [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3075.2000000000003s)]
*  governance. So the problem with the PA is they were elected I think in 2005 and they have another [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3082.1600000000003s)]
*  election since. I think President Abbas is in the 16th, 17th, 18th year of like a four-year term, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3088.48s)]
*  very not popular. He's more popular in Washington and in the United Nations than he is in his own [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3094.48s)]
*  country. It's a very corrupt system. Again, a lot of the money is gone for the leadership, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3099.2s)]
*  their family, for the top people, but it hasn't trickled down to the people. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3106.3999999999996s)]
*  There's not a lot of trust on it. I held a conference in Bahrain where I brought all the [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3110.96s)]
*  top investors in the Middle East. I brought Steve Schwarzman from Blackstone came. We had [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3114.96s)]
*  Randall Stephenson came from AT&T and everyone came and said, you know what, we actually would [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3119.52s)]
*  love to help the Palestinian people. We'd love to invest here. Then they looked at the magnitude [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3124.72s)]
*  of it. It's 3 million people, which is like a small state in the West Bank and 2 million in Gaza. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3129.3599999999997s)]
*  Again, it's like a small state in the US. Obviously, to build things, it's much cheaper. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3133.12s)]
*  I mean, the GDP per capita there is about 3,000 per person. It's cheaper labor. It's [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3137.68s)]
*  able to do it and it's connected right to Israel, which is like California not being connected to [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3143.2s)]
*  Silicon Valley. The prospects for prosperity spillover are massive, being sandwiched between [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3147.52s)]
*  the rich Gulf and the growing Israel. The thing that's missing for the Palestinians is very basic [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3153.28s)]
*  things. There's no fair judiciary. There's no rule of law. The governance is terrible. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3159.84s)]
*  The institutions are incredibly opaque. What all these people are saying is we'd love to invest [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3164.7200000000003s)]
*  here, but it's just not an investable place. The thing that's been holding back the Palestinian [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3169.28s)]
*  people has not been Israel. It's been their bad leadership. Again, you're seeing in other places [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3174.0800000000004s)]
*  in the Middle East that with the proper leadership, investments can come and those [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3178.6400000000003s)]
*  investments will actually lead to people living a much better life. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3182.32s)]
*  Nat [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3185.28s)]
*  places that could do with me. The World Bank has a lot of good institutional knowledge. They helped [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3212.32s)]
*  us work on the plan, the World Bank and the IMF. Some of the other regional governments, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3216.8s)]
*  I mean, Jordan, their government is pretty capable. I mean, they're better at military than economy, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3220.7200000000003s)]
*  but I think they're starting to focus more on economy as they realize that that's necessary. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3225.6800000000003s)]
*  If you look at the benefits of that area, the Palestinian people are like a 99% literacy rate, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3231.36s)]
*  again, through the taxpayer, US taxpayer dollars and international donations. We've paid them to [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3237.76s)]
*  become very educated. Unfortunately, I think we've poisoned their minds with a lot of what's been [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3241.92s)]
*  taught in their curriculums. They have a pretty good healthcare system there. Again, I think it [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3246.7200000000003s)]
*  could be improved because it's been done very kind of piecemeal versus holistic. Then in addition to [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3251.76s)]
*  that, they obviously have a tremendous amount of tourism sites, I mean, Jewish, Christian, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3256.64s)]
*  Muslim tourism sites. If they ever get their acts together, I mean, the boom in that area can be [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3261.6s)]
*  unbelievable. I think it could work very, very well. There was one time where the Palestinian [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3267.2799999999997s)]
*  economy was working. I think it was in about 2007, there was a guy named Salam Fayyad, who was [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3272.16s)]
*  the first time somebody came in who was, he was not corrupt. Things were happening. Wages were [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3277.12s)]
*  rising. Projects were moving. The money was actually getting to the people. He became so [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3282.56s)]
*  popular because he was doing such a good job administering that the president got rid of him, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3287.6s)]
*  that a boss got rid of him because he saw him as a threat to his power. What's happened is not [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3292.8s)]
*  different. You always have kind of a tyranny of the minority in some way with most forms of [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3297.1200000000003s)]
*  government. What happened was is as he was starting to gain popularity, he became a threat to kind of [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3302.7200000000003s)]
*  the cronyism that occurred. I think that the international community, if they're going to put [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3308.48s)]
*  money into this, again, to either rebuild, number one, it has to be conditions-based. Again, we've [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3312.88s)]
*  put tens of billions of dollars into this situation. This refugee group has gotten more [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3318.08s)]
*  money over time than any refugee group in history by a factor of maybe 100. None of it's been [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3323.04s)]
*  conditions-based and it has to be in a set where people are trying to create outcomes. I think one [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3330.88s)]
*  of the problems is a lot of the people working on this don't have business backgrounds. They [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3335.84s)]
*  understand human rights or they understand politics, but they don't understand capitalism. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3339.44s)]
*  They don't understand what kind of framework you need in order to allow a society to thrive. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3344.08s)]
*  Soterios Johnson Has treasury ever tried to trace these dollars or some other organization to just [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3348.24s)]
*  show where the theft happened and where these pools of money have gone to? [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3352.64s)]
*  Jamey Bolling There's some intelligence on it that I can't go into, but I think most people don't [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3357.7599999999998s)]
*  want to know, to be honest, Jamath. I mean, you could just look at it in a couple of ways. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3363.04s)]
*  We would meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu in Washington and he would take a commercial [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3368.96s)]
*  LL flight to come meet us. He runs a military superpower, an economic superpower in the region. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3373.04s)]
*  President Abbas would come visit us in Washington and he obviously represents a refugee group and [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3379.2s)]
*  he would fly in a $60 million Boeing business jet, a private jet to Washington. I mean, I'd meet with [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3385.04s)]
*  him and we'd be sitting around and he'd put a cigarette in his mouth and then somebody would [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3389.68s)]
*  come over and they'd light the cigarette for him. I'd be like, am I meeting with the head of a refugee [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3394.4s)]
*  group? I mean, it was a different situation. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3397.68s)]
*  Jamey Bolling But he's the reasonable one, right? The alternative is Hamas and those guys, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3401.44s)]
*  I mean, those are billionaire hypocrites who live in Qatar at the Four Seasons, right? [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3407.6s)]
*  Jamey Bolling Yeah, but my sense is you're going to get what you demand, right? I think that from [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3413.04s)]
*  the US's perspective, right? We give about $4 billion a year in foreign aid to the PA, to UNRWA, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3418.3199999999997s)]
*  to Jordan, to Egypt and we've tolerated a status quo that's not acceptable. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3423.84s)]
*  And one of the differences, again, Trump had a lot of tension with the foreign policy establishment [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3429.84s)]
*  and it was over a lot of things, right? Obviously, he wanted to end the forever wars. He felt like we [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3435.6800000000003s)]
*  should get some return on the investments we were making. He felt like USAID wasn't an entitlement. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3440.08s)]
*  But I think the biggest difference was they wanted to all maintain the world. They wanted just to [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3445.2000000000003s)]
*  manage it and he wanted to change it. And what we did by the time, again, this was one of the [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3449.2s)]
*  disagreements I had with the incoming administration, is that when we turned over the Middle East to [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3454.0s)]
*  them, again, I spoke earlier about what a mess we kind of inherited when we started, but we had [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3458.7999999999997s)]
*  five peace deals between Israel and majority Muslim countries. Iran was totally broke, again, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3465.3599999999997s)]
*  under Obama. When he left, they were selling about 2.6 million barrels of oil a day. Under Trump, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3470.96s)]
*  when he left office, they were selling 100,000 barrels of oil a day. They were out of foreign [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3476.64s)]
*  currency reserves. They were dead broke. Now they're back up to 3 million barrels a day of sales. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3480.56s)]
*  They've done over $100 billion of oil revenue since we left office. The Palestinians, one of [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3486.08s)]
*  things we did after, I think the first year is we cut the funding to UNRWA. It was very controversial. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3491.7599999999998s)]
*  We're saying, oh, this is for refugees. We said, it's not for refugees. It's to build terror tunnels [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3496.64s)]
*  and rockets. And they're saying, no, it's for schools and hospitals. And we were saying, those [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3500.48s)]
*  are the military bases. And they were saying, you guys are crazy. You're cruel. And our whole [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3503.6s)]
*  thing. And so when we left, the PA was basically broke. The Arabs had kind of lost interest in [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3508.0s)]
*  that cause because they kind of saw that it was morally bankrupt and that every time we gave a [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3513.6s)]
*  boss the opportunity to do something better for his people, he refused. And they kind of saw that [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3519.12s)]
*  we smoked him out a little bit. And so we kind of took the issue and we shrunk it tremendously. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3525.36s)]
*  And the final deal we did was between Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt, and Bahrain. And that [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3529.44s)]
*  was a critical deal to do because that was what really made it possible for Saudi and Israel to [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3535.12s)]
*  then do the deal. And that was really on the table right when we left. But it took too much time. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3541.52s)]
*  They allowed Iran to get too strong. They started allowing Iran to get money. They started funding [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3545.84s)]
*  the Palestinians and UNRWA again. And now you have a situation where it's just become a mess. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3550.2400000000002s)]
*  It could be fixed. It definitely can be fixed if you're strong and if you're smart. But if you're [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3556.08s)]
*  going to go back to kind of the old ideas, you're going to get the old results. You need new ideas. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3560.0s)]
*  You need to create the ideas and force them. You can't just wait for them to occur and then go back [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3564.72s)]
*  to the old institutions and the old people who have failed before. Who do you think should be [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3569.7599999999998s)]
*  Secretary of State in the next administration? I think Jared should. Let me ask you about the [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3573.7599999999998s)]
*  two-state solution. Let's just double-click on this. I mean, my view on this, and I think by the [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3581.76s)]
*  standards of Israeli politics, that'd be a liberal there, is that the only solution, the only way out [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3586.1600000000003s)]
*  of this is the two-state solution. We can't have a situation of indefinite permanent occupation [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3591.44s)]
*  of the Palestinian people. At some point, they developed a national consciousness. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3598.0800000000004s)]
*  And if you have conditions of permanent occupation, they're going to resist and you're [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3602.2400000000002s)]
*  going to have outbursts of terrorism. At the same time, if Israel just outright annexes these [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3606.16s)]
*  territories or continues on a program of, call it, creeping annexation, or it keeps building [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3612.64s)]
*  settlements in the West Bank, and you have a greater Israel, that eventually, Jews in Israel [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3617.92s)]
*  will not be the majority of the population. I think if you look at kind of greater Israel, [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3624.96s)]
*  there's about 7.3 million Jews. There's about 7.3 million Palestinian Arabs. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3628.3199999999997s)]
*  So, if the plan is a single greater Israel, it's either going to stop being a Jewish state [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3634.32s)]
*  because the Palestinians will vote for something different, or it'll continue being the Jewish [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3642.24s)]
*  state, but there's going to be some sort of two-tier system where a lot of Palestinians [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3647.84s)]
*  won't have the vote. And so, eventually, a greater Israel will have to choose between whether it wants [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3651.52s)]
*  to be democratic or whether it wants to be Jewish. And that seems like a very bad choice. It seems [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3655.68s)]
*  like we want both those things to be true. So, again, that kind of brings you back to a two-state [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3660.32s)]
*  solution as the only option here. And yet, it seems to me that the two-state solution has never [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3664.88s)]
*  been further away. It seems like it's never been further away in terms of Israeli domestic politics, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3671.28s)]
*  and it's never been further away in terms of having a negotiating partner to negotiate something like [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3678.32s)]
*  this with. So, that would be sort of my pessimistic outlook. I mean, I know you're pretty optimistic [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3685.04s)]
*  about the situation. Do you see it differently than that? Is that framing wrong somehow? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3691.36s)]
*  How would you see it? So, number one is I'm naturally optimistic, and I just find it's more [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3696.56s)]
*  fun to be optimistic than pessimistic. But I'll say everything I'm saying in the context of the [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3701.92s)]
*  fact that this is a really, really, really, really hard problem set, right? So, I'll try to say this [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3706.32s)]
*  in the right order. So, number one is I don't think there's any viability to a one state, [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3713.2799999999997s)]
*  and I don't think that that's something that will ever occur. Number two is, and actually, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3717.8399999999997s)]
*  you know, what's interesting, one of the problems is a lot of the Arabs and the Palestinians would [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3723.9199999999996s)]
*  actually prefer to be part of Israel than a Palestinian state. So, right before COVID, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3728.24s)]
*  we released the Trump peace plan, which, again, you can still find online. And I think the [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3732.3999999999996s)]
*  political part of it was about 54 pages. The economic part and the political part was about [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3738.16s)]
*  181 pages in detail. We, at the time, got the right wing and the left wing. Again, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3742.48s)]
*  they were in the third election, and we had Prime Minister Netanyahu and Benny Gantz, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3747.92s)]
*  who's also an amazing person, came in, and they all endorsed it. And so, what I tell you is that [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3752.1600000000003s)]
*  semantics, you know, state has to do a lot with semantics. So, you can definitely give them a [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3758.8s)]
*  state. The question is, you know, you have to give Israel certain overriding security controls so [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3762.8s)]
*  that the state cannot be a threat to them, and then you can let them kind of earn their way out [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3768.48s)]
*  of that with good behavior and showing that it's a true partnership. But what I will just tell you [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3772.16s)]
*  is that whatever you call it, you give them a flag, you can give them whatever you want, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3776.72s)]
*  unless there's a system where people can live a better life, then the grievance will overtake [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3780.72s)]
*  whatever independence they have, and it will just become a problem again. And so, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3787.2s)]
*  I do think a two-state solution is possible. Again, what you do with Gaza is very much, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3792.08s)]
*  you know, TBD, but I do think especially in the West Bank, there's definitely possibility to do it. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3796.08s)]
*  I think that from Israel, they'd like to see that happen where they'd like the Palestinians to be [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3801.2799999999997s)]
*  able to govern themselves, but it's a couple big ifs. If it's not a security threat and if they can [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3805.84s)]
*  have a viable economy, that's going to happen. One of the big things that's happening now that [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3810.72s)]
*  I'm hearing about is that I think the number was like 250,000 Palestinians who had worked visas [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3814.24s)]
*  from the West Bank to go into Israel. And now with the threat, there's just such a great distrust [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3819.68s)]
*  that has occurred that those are now not being renewed. So, I think Israel's going to have to [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3824.88s)]
*  bring in workers from other parts of the world, but that was an amazing thing, right? You had [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3828.2400000000002s)]
*  Muslims and Jews working together. You had Palestinians whose lives were better off because [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3832.08s)]
*  they were working with Israel. So, the vast majority of the Palestinians, maybe not the vast, [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3838.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't know. It's people have different perspectives on this, but I just believe that [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3842.16s)]
*  fundamentally human beings want to live a better life. I don't think our natural state is to hate [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3846.16s)]
*  each other or to not be together. Again, if you look at the Middle East for a thousand years before [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3851.2s)]
*  the Second World War, Jews and Muslims and Christians, they lived very peacefully together. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3857.3599999999997s)]
*  So, what I was seeing with the Abraham Accords and what I was hoping would occur would really [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3861.3599999999997s)]
*  be a reversion to the pre-World War II era where people were starting to live peacefully together, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3865.3599999999997s)]
*  but there's been a lot of hate that's been fermented and manipulated over this time. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3870.48s)]
*  But the best way to start it is just take it one day at a time. We used to say in government, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3875.12s)]
*  we get a hard problem. You used to say, how do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3878.8s)]
*  And so, you just have to outline where you want to get to, put in place the right system, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3883.04s)]
*  and then just start step after step after step. And then you get to a place and maybe you're able [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3887.36s)]
*  to do something that becomes viable with time. Jared, did you see the debates last night? Did [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3891.6800000000003s)]
*  you watch them? No, I did not. Sax, did you watch them? I didn't watch the whole thing. I've seen [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3898.0s)]
*  clips on social media. Do you have any takeaways? I mean, was it even worth watching? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3904.72s)]
*  Yeah, I thought the clips did a pretty good job of actually showing some of the punchier moments, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3910.7999999999997s)]
*  but the crazy thing is that the mainstream media has completely erased Vivek's candidacy. I don't [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3916.64s)]
*  even think it exists in the eyes of the mainstream media. But if you look on X, all the posts were [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3924.8799999999997s)]
*  like, he clearly won, and he was basically throwing fireballs everywhere. But then if you go to, [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3931.04s)]
*  you know, CNN or Fox, you don't even hear his name. Right. So, it's a real, real difference. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3936.56s)]
*  The mainstream media coverage is what they want you to believe. And social media is what actually [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3943.36s)]
*  happened. It's what people actually believe. And I think that if you look at social media, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3948.4s)]
*  what it shows is that Vivek dominated the debate, and he was throwing fireballs. And he was [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3954.4s)]
*  slamming the neocons on the stage and showing that there's been, I think, an irreparable break [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3961.04s)]
*  between the neocon establishment in the Republican Party and the more populist [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3968.64s)]
*  MAGA wing. So, I think that's kind of what social media is showing. And then, you know, [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3973.7599999999998s)]
*  if you listen to mainstream media, to the extent they talk about Vivek, it's that he had some sort [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3978.88s)]
*  of meltdown, and he insulted Nikki Haley's daughter or whatever, something like that. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3982.8s)]
*  But her TikTok usage. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3987.2s)]
*  Yeah, by the way, all he said is that he was being berated for why he created a TikTok account. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3988.88s)]
*  And he's like, I want to reach young people, you know, like your daughter who's on there. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3994.16s)]
*  And yeah, that's what he said. And Nikki Haley called him scum for that. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=3998.08s)]
*  Well, she also pulled the Will Smith line, like, get your, my daughter's name out your mouth. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4003.3599999999997s)]
*  Did she slap him? [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4010.4s)]
*  No, she didn't. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4011.92s)]
*  I think that's a pretty good point. There's like 75 million young Americans on TikTok. If you want [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4012.7999999999997s)]
*  to reach them, that's where you post your messages. I have seen the vakes stuff on there. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4016.96s)]
*  I've seen RFK juniors videos on there. Like everyone uses TikTok now if you want to reach [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4021.92s)]
*  people. That's his reality. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4027.68s)]
*  Nikki Haley doesn't? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4030.16s)]
*  I'm not sure. I don't know that she has much of a social media following because I don't think [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4031.44s)]
*  her campaign inspires any real grassroots. I think her campaign is supported and propped up by [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4036.96s)]
*  the GOP establishment wing. I don't think there's any market for what she's selling among the [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4042.96s)]
*  grassroots. So social media is kind of pointless for her. But if you actually want to reach people, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4047.2s)]
*  especially young people, use social media. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4051.76s)]
*  Well, it's pretty intense when Vivek said that the head of the RNC should just be fired for all the [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4054.16s)]
*  losing and kind of went through every single election in the midterms and whatnot that they've [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4060.56s)]
*  lost since she became the head of the RNC. And apparently on social media, she mouthed something [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4065.36s)]
*  to the effect of this guy's an a-hole. He's not going to get a single cent for months. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4071.44s)]
*  Yeah, I know. It's over to Ronna McDaniel. Who I know. I mean, I like Ronna, but I mean- [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4077.12s)]
*  Has she done a good job, Sax? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4082.08s)]
*  Look, it's hard for me to speak to the job she's actually done because I don't know the [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4083.52s)]
*  activities are actually involved in being RNC chair. But I mean, Vivek's point is look at the [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4087.44s)]
*  results. So if we were on the board of a company that kept missing quarter after quarter, [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4093.76s)]
*  and the CEO said, no, look at all the good things I'm doing, we would probably still fire that CEO. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4099.76s)]
*  Just because you're like, how do things get worse? Right? You just take the chance that [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4104.32s)]
*  you bring in a new CEO, they're going to do better. So the reality is our results [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4108.56s)]
*  in the Republican Party have been shitty lately. Now, is that all Ronna's fault? No, it may not be [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4112.72s)]
*  much of her fault at all, but how do you do worse? I think a big reason for the crappy results [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4117.04s)]
*  have been the abortion issue. We've now had this issue on the ballot in at least six states, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4123.28s)]
*  most of which were red states, a couple of them are purple states. It's lost every time. The [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4131.68s)]
*  anti-abortion or pro-life side has lost decisively every time. And I think there's a lot of reasons [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4136.32s)]
*  to vote Republican. I think Republicans have the advantage on the economy, on border, on anything [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4143.76s)]
*  related to woke, on crime and homelessness. These are all issues that should be big winners for [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4150.8s)]
*  Republicans, but the public by, I think probably a two thirds majority does not want to ban [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4158.08s)]
*  abortion. And as long as that issue is in the forefront, Republicans are going to lose. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4165.84s)]
*  And actually it was Ann Coulter who just said this. Ann Coulter had a really good [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4170.400000000001s)]
*  blog post about this saying that the pro-life, yeah, I retweeted it. By the way, she's very pro-life. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4174.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, she's a social conservative, but she says that pro-life is going to wipe out the Republican [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4181.5199999999995s)]
*  party. They need to focus on non-political activities, which is winning over hearts and minds. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4186.08s)]
*  They have to make the case to the country. They have to persuade more people because they're not [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4192.4s)]
*  in a position. They are not popular enough to actually win elections. You concur, Jared. Do [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4197.12s)]
*  you think the Republican party is going to change their position or need to change their position to [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4200.96s)]
*  win elections, presidential election aside? Well, ultimately if you don't win, then you can't govern [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4204.8s)]
*  and you can impact the change that you want to do. So I do think that people are definitely paying [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4210.56s)]
*  attention. The results are the results. I will say that one thing with Trump, he won with his [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4214.88s)]
*  operation. We were able to overperform our polling. I think here in these last times, there's been [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4220.24s)]
*  underperformance of polling. And so that's something that obviously you have to look at, which is [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4225.44s)]
*  very troubling. But I'll also say that with what I found, again, I'm not really [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4230.160000000001s)]
*  somebody who was newer to the Republican party. What I found is that both parties are really, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4235.200000000001s)]
*  I would say, collections of tribes. You have different tribes that make up the party. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4239.68s)]
*  But what I found in the Republican party was that there was a ton of infighting and finger [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4244.160000000001s)]
*  pointing and purity tests. Instead of saying, I'm happy you agree with me on 70% or 80%, [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4248.240000000001s)]
*  it was basically saying, well, if you don't agree with me on 100%, then you're a bad Republican. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4255.28s)]
*  And I think that that's a culture that's going to lead to you having very strong opinions, [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4259.92s)]
*  but having no ability to effectuate things. I think that people have to say, where do we agree [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4264.88s)]
*  on different issues? Where do we agree on issues? How can we work together to do it? But if you don't [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4269.599999999999s)]
*  win, then you're not going to be able to effectuate the things you want. And even worse, the other [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4275.04s)]
*  side is going to be effectuating the things they want. And you look at where the world is today [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4278.5599999999995s)]
*  because of that. There's a lot of internecine fighting in the Republican party. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4281.92s)]
*  I think Trump's instincts on abortion actually have been very good. I said this a couple of [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4286.56s)]
*  months ago. There was kind of a brouhaha on the right when Trump gave an interview in which he [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4290.72s)]
*  said that actually what DeSantis had done in Florida with the six-week ban was a mistake. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4296.88s)]
*  And that he sort of upleveled the issue and just said, I'm going to find a compromise that makes [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4302.4800000000005s)]
*  everybody happy. And this created a lot of upset people on the right because they thought that [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4306.88s)]
*  Trump was kind of selling them out on the abortion issue. And I made this case on Megyn Kelly a couple [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4311.68s)]
*  of months ago that I thought that what Trump was doing was pretty smart because he doesn't want to [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4316.0s)]
*  get pinned down on an issue that's going to hurt him in the general. And I think part of the reason [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4322.0s)]
*  why he was being a little bit cagey on that issue is because he knows it would hurt him in the general [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4326.96s)]
*  and he's starting to think about that. And I think the results that we just had the other day are [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4333.92s)]
*  strong vindication of that. And just let me say just more generally that whenever Trump has opposed [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4338.48s)]
*  Republican groupthink on an issue, I think he's invariably been proven correct. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4345.2s)]
*  If you go all the way back to 2016, think about all the heresies that he committed in the [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4350.08s)]
*  Republican Party. He spoke out against the forever wars, against Bush's forever wars. I think he was [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4356.4s)]
*  right about that. At the time, the Republican Party either wasn't talking about immigration or [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4360.879999999999s)]
*  didn't really seem to care. He basically made the border a huge issue. I think it's proven right [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4366.4s)]
*  about that. The issue of China and China trade was not an issue in the Republican Party. If anything, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4371.36s)]
*  it was sort of this sort of unreconstructed free trade, total free trade issue. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4378.879999999999s)]
*  Ryan was pushing the TPP value. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4384.48s)]
*  Right, exactly. So Trump defied the orthodoxy on that. I think it was proven correct. Paul [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4386.719999999999s)]
*  Ryan also wanted to ratchet back entitlements like Social Security, Medicare, and Trump thought that [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4390.5599999999995s)]
*  was suicidal for the GOP. So he opposed that. I think on all these issues, whenever he has defied [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4395.44s)]
*  the orthodoxy, he's been proven correct. I don't know if it's a conscious thing or it's just that [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4401.44s)]
*  he's got tremendous gut instincts as a politician. Be curious to get Jared's take on that. How much [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4406.5599999999995s)]
*  of this is sort of him working things out and how much of it is just his gut? But I think this is [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4411.759999999999s)]
*  why he's still the candidate to beat for the Republican nomination is at the end of the day, [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4417.919999999999s)]
*  for all of Trump's issues. He's actually the best politician in the Republican Party. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4423.12s)]
*  I would see the way that he would work on trade. And again, trade deals usually take five, six years. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4427.599999999999s)]
*  His attitude on trade was that whenever there's a multilateral, it's the weaker countries all [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4433.2s)]
*  ganging up on the stronger party. And so he says, I want to do them bilaterally. So he withdrew from [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4438.719999999999s)]
*  TPP, which everyone went crazy and said it was a disaster. Well, we ended up negotiating with Japan [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4443.04s)]
*  and Korea and everyone. And we got basically 95% of the market access that was in TPP without [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4448.0s)]
*  giving up any of the things that would have absolutely decimated our auto industry. We [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4452.88s)]
*  renegotiate the NAFTA, which everyone said Obama said they would. Bush said he wanted to fix it. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4456.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump came in, in a year and a half, we renegotiated NAFTA and it got over 80 votes in [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4462.72s)]
*  the Senate. It was a bipartisan win and it set the highest standards for labor protection. It did a [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4466.88s)]
*  lot of great things that I think make America way more competitive and hopefully will reduce [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4471.92s)]
*  our trade deficit. So these were all things that he took on that people weren't willing to. And [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4476.72s)]
*  again, he said, you know, look, if I'm wrong, you know, putting tariffs on these different countries. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4481.84s)]
*  I remember people coming into him saying, see, if you put these tariffs on, the whole world's [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4485.52s)]
*  going to explode. The US economy is going to blow up. And I remember sitting with him privately. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4489.2s)]
*  And he said to me, you know, Jared, we had a year debate and we had some people who were more [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4493.360000000001s)]
*  religious about this issue than anything else. And he says, you know, Jared, I've been saying [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4497.4400000000005s)]
*  this for 30 years. I believe it. I campaigned on it. I won on it. I have to see it. Like I have to [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4501.44s)]
*  see it through it. You know, it turns out it's a big disaster. I can always take them off. You know, [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4507.36s)]
*  and so that was kind of like his way of thinking about it where he had his instinct. He followed [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4511.04s)]
*  his instinct, but he knew he could always back off. And I think his flexibility and unpredictability [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4514.5599999999995s)]
*  were some of his greatest assets. And I think also on the border and immigration, again, [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4519.36s)]
*  it's an issue as somebody, you know, grew up, you know, in New Jersey and then was living on the [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4522.799999999999s)]
*  Upper East Side that I didn't know a lot of resonance for, but now you're seeing my friends [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4526.48s)]
*  in New York. Now they're getting a taste of what it can do, you know, to the country. They're [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4529.84s)]
*  becoming, you know, big immigration hawks like Trump. The thing that the Republicans need to [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4533.84s)]
*  realize right now is that if you pick these topics that go down the rabbit hole, you're going to be [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4537.76s)]
*  in a really tough spot in the general because the economy is also going to be in reasonable shape. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4543.52s)]
*  Now, if we were going to go into a November election where we were going to be in a recession, [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4550.16s)]
*  that's very bad for Biden. But sort of the tea leaves for whatever it's worth, all the predictions, [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4554.32s)]
*  all the predictive markets show that we're going to be in a reasonable place. And so [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4560.4s)]
*  the Republicans get need to get very, very focused, as you say, on the real issues list here, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4565.2s)]
*  right? Because they're not going to have the benefit of the tailwind of a bad economy to say [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4570.5599999999995s)]
*  President Biden has done a bad job necessarily. And so the message will need to be even more [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4574.96s)]
*  precise and focused. And so I think that that's going to be an important thing. I did a little [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4579.44s)]
*  tea leaf reading on macro if you guys want it. I have some charts. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4583.68s)]
*  Yeah, just let me just give you a little rundown of because I went and I you know, look, we used to [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4587.360000000001s)]
*  talk about these things when I was when we were doing a lot of forecasting going into this cycle. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4592.0s)]
*  But so here's like a couple of really interesting observations. So the first one is when you look [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4598.96s)]
*  at this M2 money supply, look how much it's actually shrunk. Now, why that's interesting to [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4606.4800000000005s)]
*  me is that you have these two forces that are opposing each other. One is we have these huge [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4613.12s)]
*  deficits. So we're technically still, frankly, issuing a lot of money, right. But then on the [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4619.28s)]
*  other side, we have QT. So when debt rolls off, we're not reissuing it. And the balance of that [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4624.5599999999995s)]
*  is still a really constructive thing where now you can see that, you know, M2 has materially [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4630.5599999999995s)]
*  started to shrink. And I think that that's a really positive thing, because now what that does it [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4636.24s)]
*  combats inflation in a good way. Unfortunately, for all of us, it hurts financial assets, which [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4641.12s)]
*  is not so good. I think we've all felt that pain. But the reality is that that's been working. So [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4646.32s)]
*  then Nick, if you go to the second chart, so what you see now is like, we are in a really decent [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4651.12s)]
*  place with inflation. And if you think about what's going to happen over the next six months, [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4657.2s)]
*  it's mostly in the bag. And meaning, we talked about this before, but there's a lag effect on [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4662.64s)]
*  a handful of components, specifically rents, which when you roll them into this inflation rate, [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4668.8s)]
*  you're going to see it really, really turn over very quickly. Right. So we know that inflation [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4675.28s)]
*  is falling, it's going to fall even more. The second thing, Nick, the third chart here is you [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4680.8s)]
*  can see that now validated in these 10 year break evens. Remember, this was the chart we used to [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4687.68s)]
*  look at when we were like, Holy mackerel, something's going to break in November of 21. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4692.0s)]
*  I think we probably should have just sold everything we had in November 21. We didn't [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4697.12s)]
*  do it. But the point is now we know. And what you see here is the 10 year break evens are also [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4701.28s)]
*  telling us, okay, guys, we're going to be in a pretty decent place. And so I think the setup is [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4707.68s)]
*  basically the following. There's less money in the system. That's a positive. Nick, if you show the [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4713.599999999999s)]
*  last chart, there's more money on the sidelines. And this is just a picture of I mean, look at the [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4719.28s)]
*  amount of money in money market funds, six trillion and growing. So that's a really positive [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4724.08s)]
*  sign, which is that money will need to find a home. Once we have once, no, even just now, [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4730.48s)]
*  because you're gonna you're gonna be in a situation where, and I'll get to this in a second, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4738.16s)]
*  but companies are now starting to perform because they've been able to re baseline against very, [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4742.24s)]
*  very lowered expectations. Right. And money managers have to do their job and deploy capital. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4746.64s)]
*  And that's something we mentioned, I think last week, but this is now the beginning of the new [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4751.759999999999s)]
*  fiscal year for the entire mutual fund complex. So that's trillions of dollars that have to get [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4755.5199999999995s)]
*  deployed, because even though you pay them a very small fee per year, you're not paying them to hold [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4761.12s)]
*  cash, you're paying them to make decisions and own assets. And then as you said, Freebird, the [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4766.4s)]
*  last part of this is now you introduce rate cuts. And that's a real accelerant. Now, more than [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4771.28s)]
*  likely, I think what that means is that markets are set up to do pretty well equity markets, [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4777.6s)]
*  specifically. And so I went and I said, Well, how can we see some data that proves that this is [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4781.68s)]
*  happening? And what's amazing is if you look at the performance of what I would call the most risk [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4787.76s)]
*  adjusted seeking companies, so those are tech businesses that have been absolutely hammered. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4794.96s)]
*  What you see in the last month is they have gone just nuclear. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4800.88s)]
*  Adyen up 30% in a matter of a week, DoorDash is up, you know, 25 30% in a matter of a week, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4804.08s)]
*  Datadog up 30% in a matter of a week, these are the businesses that were just completely decimated. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4810.8s)]
*  So what is all of this saying? I think what what it's kind of saying is inflation is very much in [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4818.16s)]
*  the rearview mirror, rates are going to get cut by the middle part of the year, the economy looks [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4823.360000000001s)]
*  like it's going to be a soft landing. That is actually very beneficial for the sitting president. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4829.36s)]
*  It's also good for equities, it's good for us. So it's really interesting, actually, I think we've [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4836.0s)]
*  had a fundamental kind of now change. Jared, do you think this will have an effect on the election [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4841.12s)]
*  cycle? I think it definitely could. But I do think a lot of people are still very concerned. I know [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4845.2s)]
*  the, the the the the inflation, the the wages, wage inflation is still about 4%. I think that [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4848.799999999999s)]
*  people are, are still just nervous about what could come. I think there's been a lot of shocks, [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4855.52s)]
*  and there's been a couple of times where it's felt that way. And I think that, you know, election [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4861.2s)]
*  years traditionally bring a lot more volatility to the market, because there's unpredictability [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4865.36s)]
*  about what the policy will be going forward. So I think that, of people who have kind of been a [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4868.72s)]
*  little whiplash from the transition of over the last year to 18 months, see that they're going [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4873.52s)]
*  into another cycle of uncertainty, I think that's going to be a big, big, big, big, big, big, big [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4879.12s)]
*  I do think that, you know, now you're actually getting paid to not do anything with your money [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4884.72s)]
*  in those money market accounts. So there's less of a, maybe less of a FOMO to kind of go out and do [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4888.72s)]
*  something there. So, so I think that a lot of people are still gonna be very much in kind of [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4893.280000000001s)]
*  wait and see mode and obviously look for special opportunities, which I think will only further [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4898.160000000001s)]
*  exacerbate a potential decline as well. Jared, last week, we talked about real estate, you used [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4902.96s)]
*  to be in the real estate business, what do you have any thoughts on commercial real estate and how [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4908.400000000001s)]
*  good, bad, average things are? So I still have a lot of exposure to commercial real estate through [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4913.44s)]
*  my family's company. And we're mostly in the multifamily space. I think the office space right [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4918.719999999999s)]
*  now is in for a massive change in the industry. I think you're going to see a lot of the older [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4923.759999999999s)]
*  buildings get, get transitioned. A lot of them are trading now for below land price, which is, [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4929.2s)]
*  which is pretty remarkable. I think you have, you also have a transition and kind of what are the [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4934.16s)]
*  cities of growth, right? So you look at a place like San Francisco, and there's a big debate over [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4938.96s)]
*  whether AI is going to save the office market there, whether it's kind of like the Detroit of [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4943.52s)]
*  this industrial revolution, and it's just never going to come back. And then you're seeing a lot [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4948.08s)]
*  of these San Francisco companies move to New York and the New York people are saying, oh, there's [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4951.84s)]
*  too much crime and homelessness. And they're saying, compared to San Francisco, this looks like, [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4955.92s)]
*  you know, it's a beautiful place. And so, you know, New York is still doing, I think, okay, [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4959.76s)]
*  but you're seeing a lot of plays throughout the country that are, but the fundamental with real [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4966.24s)]
*  estate is it's correlated to interest rates. And so, you know, if interest rates, you know, [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4970.48s)]
*  right now, I think the 10 years at like four and a half, if it goes up to six, then you're just [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4974.32s)]
*  going to see a repricing and real estate assets. If it settles at, at four and a half five, then [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4978.08s)]
*  you'll, you'll probably see more stability and what that will be. But ultimately, real estate's [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4982.719999999999s)]
*  become much more institutionalized over the last call it two decades. And it's really a function of, [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4987.2s)]
*  you know, what are your, your rent and expense growths, and then what kind of, what, what can [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4991.679999999999s)]
*  you borrow at? And can you create, you know, a positive yield that's hopefully a good hedge [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4995.28s)]
*  against inflation? So I think net net, it will be a great asset class. I mean, it's probably one of [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4999.36s)]
*  the biggest asset classes in the world. I think right now, though, a lot of people are just holding [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5004.0s)]
*  back because they're not certain what the, what the, what the multiples or cap rates, as they call [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5009.12s)]
*  them in real estate, are going to be on a forward basis. But they're really going to be a function of, [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5014.16s)]
*  of what's the growth in the economy going to be, and then also what the forward interest rates will be. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5018.24s)]
*  That's fair. I think that everything's challenged in real estate. I mean, the demand size challenge, [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5025.28s)]
*  because you've had the whole work from home, COVID disruption, and a lot of cities haven't [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5029.759999999999s)]
*  fully come back. I think New York's come back at this point, but like San Francisco definitely hasn't. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5035.04s)]
*  I think New York is something like 95% of workers are back in the office. I think in San Francisco, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5039.28s)]
*  it's only like 45%. So you've got demand issues, then you've got financing issues. You know, [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5044.4s)]
*  refinancing is much more expensive because interest rates are higher. And then you've got [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5051.12s)]
*  these cap rate issues where no one knows what the long-term valuations are going to be. So [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5054.72s)]
*  everything's a mess. And by the way, that gets compounded by the fact that now banks that have [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5058.8s)]
*  office exposure are pulling back their lending. So you have a combination of, you know, cost of [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5063.76s)]
*  borrowing being higher, and then the availability of liquidity going lower. And that could further [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5068.320000000001s)]
*  compound a lot of these refinances. But a lot of what the people I know in the industry are telling [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5073.92s)]
*  me is that they're able just to work with existing lenders and just do some kind of extension and, [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5077.52s)]
*  you know, just kind of live to fight for another day to get through the cycle. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5082.639999999999s)]
*  And I will say in New York that the rental rates for residential are, I think, are at historic highs. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5085.5199999999995s)]
*  And actually what my family's seen in their portfolio is that their properties in Jersey [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5091.36s)]
*  City, which is basically like the sixth borough of New York, are just absolutely on fire because [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5095.599999999999s)]
*  it's basically, you know, you go into New York, now you go to a CVS, everything's locked up, [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5100.0s)]
*  you can't buy anything. It doesn't feel necessarily like the safest city. You go into Jersey City, [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5103.599999999999s)]
*  they actually have like, you know, law and order and rule of law. And so, [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5107.92s)]
*  you still take a train to New York, and that's actually been a place that's done incredibly well. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5112.08s)]
*  So you always have micro markets, and you have different trends that work and don't work. But [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5116.0s)]
*  I wouldn't bet against New York, it's still an amazing city. And one thing about New York is, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5120.4s)]
*  every time I'm there, I always talk with some of the cops. And I basically ask them, I say, [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5124.72s)]
*  if you had a mayor that said, go be cops, go be cops, nobody's gonna, you know, hold you back, [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5129.68s)]
*  get out of the car, do what you do, we got you back. How long would it take you to clean this [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5135.04s)]
*  place up? And the answer I get is usually anywhere from like three months to six months. So like, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5138.88s)]
*  we could have this place fixed. So clearly, they just have to let us be cops again. And so I am [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5142.400000000001s)]
*  hopeful that, you know, eventually there'll be the political will to just, you know, let New York be [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5147.28s)]
*  what it has the potential to be. It's such an amazing dynamic place. It's such a good point. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5151.28s)]
*  I mean, it really is just a matter of political will. Yeah. If you hire more cops and let them [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5155.84s)]
*  do their job, that will stop the crime, or certainly the incentive for crime. Right now, [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5161.36s)]
*  people think they can get away with this stuff. And they don't get prosecuted when they get caught. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5167.44s)]
*  The jails are like a revolving door. Yeah, they have plenty of cops, they just have to let them [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5170.639999999999s)]
*  do their jobs. And they need prosecutors who will do their jobs as well. And I worked at Manhattan [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5174.719999999999s)]
*  District Attorney's Office when I was at NYU Law for the summer. I mean, you have amazing people [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5178.88s)]
*  there. And if they are allowed to kind of follow the procedures and just do the job in the way it's [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5183.04s)]
*  been done before, you can make that city very, very safe very quickly. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5187.92s)]
*  We actually have a cop shortage in San Francisco as well. It's not just a matter of not letting [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5192.0s)]
*  them do their job. We actually have a massive shortage. The city needs to hire a lot more. They [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5197.36s)]
*  allowed a pretty high rate of attrition in the role. I don't think there's a lot of people who [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5203.2s)]
*  want to be cops in San Francisco. It's a pretty tough job and they don't get a lot of support. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5206.88s)]
*  So yeah, we actually have a shortage here. And that's a big problem. Yeah. But it's very [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5212.32s)]
*  solvable, as you say, I mean, just hire more, train them, let them do their jobs. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5216.08s)]
*  Jared, how much do you think federal deficits and the federal debt matters going to this [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5221.04s)]
*  election cycle? Is it going to be a top topic? Or is it not really going to matter? And then [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5226.5599999999995s)]
*  more importantly, how consequential is it in reality? I think in reality, it's massively [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5230.08s)]
*  consequential. I think in the election cycle, I think both parties are going to probably try [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5235.84s)]
*  to avoid talking about it. Because I think that everyone knows, you know, what I find in politics [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5240.32s)]
*  is when some things are really big issue, people try not to talk about it that much. And the [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5244.64s)]
*  top is going to have to get cut, right? The hope is, is that, you know, once you get through the [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5249.4400000000005s)]
*  election, things can be done to have to deal with it. But it's definitely an issue that needs to be [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5254.88s)]
*  dealt with. What do you think that is? Raising revenue or cutting expenses or both? Growth. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5259.4400000000005s)]
*  Growth is the answer everyone. That's the political cop out answer is growth. Six percent [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5268.0s)]
*  economic GDP growth. How about we freeze spending until the denominator can grow big enough to [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5273.6s)]
*  reduce the I mean, balanced budget amendment, etc. But but speaking of GDP growth, I mean, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5278.4800000000005s)]
*  do you guys want to cover tech stories and AI this week real quick before we wrap? I mean, [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5283.280000000001s)]
*  it's really incredible. Can I just I got I can't resist getting Jared on the record about the [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5287.68s)]
*  Russia Ukraine war. Oh, so I mean, this is a war that I thought was very easily avoidable. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5293.84s)]
*  You have a one minute budget. One minute budget. That's all I need. I'm starting to [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5298.8s)]
*  shot. Timotha is going to ring the gavel. I'm going to take a break. Go you got 60 seconds. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5302.72s)]
*  Well, I think I think David's happy to have somebody who agrees with him on [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5307.4400000000005s)]
*  most of what he's been saying. So, yeah, we worked with with Ukraine and we worked well with Russia [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5312.4800000000005s)]
*  during our four years. I like to point out to people that when we were in kind of our worst [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5317.84s)]
*  moments in covid, the second country that sent us a plane load of supplies and ventilators when [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5322.8s)]
*  New York looked like it was on the verge of going under was Russia. And that was because we were [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5327.2s)]
*  offering them the possibility of working together. We armed Ukraine, but we also told Ukraine, [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5331.76s)]
*  you know, don't even think about raising NATO as a membership as a way to go. I think what happened [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5336.320000000001s)]
*  was is the Biden administration had conversations with Ukraine about joining NATO. Russia basically [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5342.0s)]
*  pushed their their military to the front line to say we are never going to let this happen. If you [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5347.6s)]
*  go through kind of the geography and the history, you understand why Russia will never let that [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5351.360000000001s)]
*  occur. And I think it was right after the embarrassment of what happened with our withdrawal [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5356.72s)]
*  in Afghanistan, where they thought that we had a weak America that was going to come and do much [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5360.96s)]
*  to it. So I think it was all very, very avoidable. I think that, you know, from what I read and again, [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5365.28s)]
*  I wasn't involved in these conversations, it did feel like there were some off ramps initially. But [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5370.16s)]
*  I do think that from our perspective, I think the number one interest has always been how do we avoid [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5374.88s)]
*  a nuclear war? I don't think that that's that's something we want to see happen. And I do think [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5378.88s)]
*  that I do think that hopefully they'll be able to find some kind of resolution to to not have that [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5383.2s)]
*  be a problem. I will say to that that's impacting the Middle East. I mean, right now what's happening [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5389.84s)]
*  with with Israel and with with the Palestinians in Iran is basically a proxy war for Russia. I mean, [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5393.28s)]
*  if America decided tomorrow, let's change and support the Palestinians, that Russia would come [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5399.4400000000005s)]
*  and be for Israel. I mean, there's not a lot of ideology for them in that. But I think Russia and [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5402.96s)]
*  China want to see the US stretched and distracted so that we're less focused on kind of the areas [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5407.52s)]
*  where we're more directly in in conflict with them. And so I think that that's a very major [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5412.72s)]
*  thing. And I will say to like, I think that, you know, I don't believe that that countries [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5418.72s)]
*  have permanent allies or permanent enemies. You know, during my time in government, we deal with [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5423.12s)]
*  the Germans and the Japanese who were vicious in World War Two, and we'd be against the Chinese and [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5427.2s)]
*  we'd be against the Russians who were basically our allies in World War Two. And so I don't think [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5431.92s)]
*  countries really have friends, I think countries have have interests. And I think that with with [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5437.6s)]
*  most countries, you have areas of overlapping interest. And I think that you can find those even [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5441.84s)]
*  with countries where you're in opposition for so, you know, one of the the operating principles I [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5446.56s)]
*  brought to all the different foreign policy problem sets I was given was, don't condemn tomorrow to be [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5451.280000000001s)]
*  like yesterday, because you think it has to be. And so I would always look at something, I try to [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5456.88s)]
*  pull whatever optimism I could find and then say, you know, what's the best case scenario from a [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5462.160000000001s)]
*  first principles perspective, I'd start there, and then I'd work through all the problems that you [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5467.4400000000005s)]
*  had to try to get there. So, so so David, I think you've been way more right on Ukraine than than [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5471.84s)]
*  others. And, and I do think there's been a tremendous amount that's been mismanaged by by [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5477.52s)]
*  the US and by the world in that in that scenario. And I think it's unfortunate, too, because I think [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5482.64s)]
*  a lot of people have been killed in that war. And I do think that obviously, the invasion of Ukraine [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5486.64s)]
*  was was was a terrible thing, it should never have happened. But I do think there's a lot of [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5491.68s)]
*  acts by leaders that could have been done in order to either prevent it or minimize it. And I still [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5496.08s)]
*  think that that's the job of leaders in the world is to try to do the hard things and try to do the [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5502.88s)]
*  things to make the world a less volatile and dangerous place. You think it's coming to an end? [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5507.360000000001s)]
*  It's definitely lost its prominence. It does seem militarily. Again, I'm sitting here in Miami, you [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5512.8s)]
*  know, reading, you know, you know, x and newspapers and talking to folks. So I'm not going to opine [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5518.72s)]
*  like I'm a general on the front lines. But but it does seem like it's kind of reached a point where [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5524.08s)]
*  it's not much is going to change militarily. And, and, and, you know, again, like every day that [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5529.84s)]
*  goes on, there's just more life that's being lost. And again, I said the same thing with Israel, [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5535.5199999999995s)]
*  but I'd say here, I mean, Russia and Ukraine both have, you know, unbelievably brilliant people, [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5539.2s)]
*  if you take all these young men, and you take them off the battle lines and put it back into [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5543.12s)]
*  their jobs of creating things, I just think that that that's just a much better thing for the world. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5547.28s)]
*  So my hope is that, you know, the leaders involved try to find a way to get to a resolution. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5552.24s)]
*  Again, I think that, you know, both sides have maybe over promised their people what what victory [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5557.28s)]
*  looks like. But that's the job of negotiation, right? You need to, you know, you need to find [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5561.92s)]
*  an off ramp for everyone and get them to a place where we can, you know, start focusing on how to [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5565.5199999999995s)]
*  make tomorrow better instead of litigating grievances from the past. Do you guys see that [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5569.76s)]
*  Sonny Sonny tweeted this thing he had dinner last night with Farhan Tawar, who is the VP of [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5573.92s)]
*  Engineering at Shopify. Do you see his tweet? Can you find it? He said that Shopify has written [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5580.08s)]
*  more than a million lines of code with copilot already. Oh, wow. I was like, what? Yeah. I mean, [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5587.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't exactly know. There's your GDP growth, Jared. Well, that's definitely growth. I wonder [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5595.84s)]
*  whether it'll be it'll be GD. I mean, I think it will. I think a lot of product [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5603.12s)]
*  productivity gains are going to drive the economy forward. Historically, I was just talking with [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5609.68s)]
*  someone this past week about over the last couple of decades, we've seen a massive shift [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5614.96s)]
*  on GDP growth being driven largely by labor, the labor force growing and labor participation. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5619.84s)]
*  And increasingly, in the last couple of years, there's been this tremendous shift that all GDP [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5626.400000000001s)]
*  growth is predominantly driven by productivity gains and productivity gains, you know, economically [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5630.56s)]
*  net their way through the system. And you see the total GDP growth. This is the whole argument for [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5637.04s)]
*  AI, particularly at a moment like this, that if you're having a declining population, you're [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5642.72s)]
*  having declining labor participation, people want to work fewer hours. If you want to keep growing [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5646.4s)]
*  the economy in order to sustain the debt and the services that you provide through government [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5651.84s)]
*  infrastructure, you have to grow the economy and you have to increase productivity. It's the only [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5657.04s)]
*  way forward. So I mean, like you could have one, it's not like you're going to fire engineers, [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5661.6s)]
*  you're just going to have one engineer do five times as much. If you just solve the whole budget [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5665.44s)]
*  deficit and debt issue, you found the productivity driven by by the AI advancements, which by the way, [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5669.919999999999s)]
*  there is a lot of tremendous productivity gains that will occur because of this. I always give [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5677.599999999999s)]
*  people the example of the tractor. Like when the tractor came around, it's not like, you know, [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5681.599999999999s)]
*  people were like, hey, we're going to make less food now or you know, what happened was we were [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5686.24s)]
*  able to farm 10 times as much and you know, total output increased. And when total output [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5689.84s)]
*  increased, there was an abundance of surplus of food, of calories that fed people, population grew, [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5695.360000000001s)]
*  the overall economy grew. There's no point in history that we've had a productivity gain [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5701.04s)]
*  through technology that didn't ultimately grow the economy. Like it's never, [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5706.4800000000005s)]
*  well, ever gone the other way. In 1900, I think about 50% of workers in America were somehow [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5710.96s)]
*  involved in agriculture. Yeah, by 2000, it was down to like 2%. So it's not like we had a 40% [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5717.6s)]
*  unemployment rate. All these other industries grew. That labor figured out a way to do new and [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5725.68s)]
*  productive things and that led to more wealth. That being said, it did cause a lot of social [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5729.84s)]
*  disruption. And I think certain job classes went away. It had to get replaced by others that had [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5734.72s)]
*  to be invented. If you think about a world where there's a million little companies or [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5739.280000000001s)]
*  50 million companies or 500 million companies that exist because they're one and two person [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5744.56s)]
*  teams that can build stuff, that seems pretty reasonable and logical as the outcome. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5750.160000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of sort of like [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5756.4800000000005s)]
*  financial engineering that kind of goes away in that world, right? I think the job of the [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5760.88s)]
*  venture capitalist changes really profoundly. I think there's a reasonable case to make that [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5766.080000000001s)]
*  it doesn't exist. It's more of an automated system of capital against objectives, right? [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5771.36s)]
*  And that you want to be making many, many, many small $100,000, $500,000 bets. And then you get [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5776.799999999999s)]
*  to this much larger scale where then once you get someplace, you can go and get the 100 and 200 [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5784.88s)]
*  million dollar checks. I don't know how else all of this gets supported financially. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5789.599999999999s)]
*  Well, so there were a couple of big news stories this week. One was Elon launched Grok, which is a [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5795.5199999999995s)]
*  chat GPT, call it competitor. It took them about under his XAI business unit, took him about eight [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5803.04s)]
*  months to train Grok one, which is the model. And by many measures is as performative as GPT three [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5810.0s)]
*  to half GPT four at the same Grok zero. It took three months to train Grok zero. He's still training [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5816.799999999999s)]
*  Grok one. Sorry, three months to train Grok zero. Kai-Fu Lee, you guys know Kai-Fu. He was at [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5822.72s)]
*  Google. He was at Microsoft. Yeah. And he is in China and built his business starting eight months [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5829.52s)]
*  ago. And in those eight months, he's now delivered a 34 billion parameter model that he's completely [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5839.280000000001s)]
*  open source that he shows by again, some performative metrics outperforms llama two. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5848.72s)]
*  And again, doing it from China speaks, I think really clearly and importantly, to the point [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5854.96s)]
*  we talked about last week about if the US tries to overregulate AI model development, [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5860.320000000001s)]
*  there are alternatives out there, particularly open source alternatives that will continue to [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5866.08s)]
*  proliferate and improve. And again, this was done in eight months. And then it's almost like the [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5870.08s)]
*  timing was perfect because in the same week, open AI responds with developer day. They didn't [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5876.8s)]
*  necessarily respond to the developer day on the books for a long time. And at developer day, [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5882.64s)]
*  open AI released a number of really powerful tools for developers that allow them to build [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5887.28s)]
*  really powerful applications and infrastructure on top of open AI platform. So they released [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5892.64s)]
*  APIs for Dolly three, four cents to generate an image using the Dolly three API. They launched a [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5899.76s)]
*  tool to create your own GPT, which can actually leverage proprietary data. So from within your [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5906.88s)]
*  own database, you're in your, your own data lake, you can build a GPT that you can then integrate [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5912.88s)]
*  into applications and GPT for turbo with two versions that have, you know, pretty powerful [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5918.88s)]
*  pricing improvements. All of this being said, it's a, it's a big leap forward in what feels [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5926.56s)]
*  like a low cost, low friction, multimodal developer friendly set of tools from open AI [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5931.6s)]
*  that allows them to move away from having the quote best model to now having what feels like [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5937.4400000000005s)]
*  much more of a platform business that as more applications and more developers start to utilize [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5943.04s)]
*  open AI toolkit and services, a real ecosystem starts to develop and that creates a sustainable [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5948.72s)]
*  business mode rather than just the technical mode that open AI started with. So I think the big point [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5956.48s)]
*  is that we're seeing the technical gap narrow between the best and the average or the worst in [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5961.28s)]
*  the median in model development. We're also now seeing that the evolution for a lot of these [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5968.08s)]
*  businesses is through open AI, trying to build, you know, applications on top of a platform and [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5974.48s)]
*  build a business mode. And so there's a real shift underway, but net net, I think what the market's [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5980.08s)]
*  forcing everyone to do is really compete and build these incredible capabilities that are really [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5984.48s)]
*  going to launch a number of new business models, new innovations. Are we building apps for the iOS [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5988.719999999999s)]
*  app store? Are we building web pages for the open internet? And I think open AI's hope is that it's [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=5994.959999999999s)]
*  apps for the app store because it's proprietary and they own it. They could take a share. I think the [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6001.36s)]
*  reality is it's going to end up as the open web. And again, I think it's mostly because [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6005.2s)]
*  everybody else just can't afford to let one company run away with it. And so, you know, whether [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6012.08s)]
*  it's Llama or Mistral or even Grok when Elon open sources it, it's going to allow people [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6016.88s)]
*  to have access to these tools basically for free. The problem that I think it creates is, you know, [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6024.4s)]
*  we had a, you know, when I first came to the United States, my, the company that I worked at, [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6031.04s)]
*  AOL, they were the ones that believed in a fundamentally closed internet, right? And you [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6037.92s)]
*  had this service and you went into the walled garden of AOL. And then the pendulum swung over [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6044.08s)]
*  the last 20 years and we opened it up at Facebook and at other places. And now we have this [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6049.76s)]
*  fundamentally open architecture. The problem now is these models will not get better unless you have [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6054.0s)]
*  fine tuning that happens by yourself or these reinforcement learning loops that come from data [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6059.84s)]
*  that you control. And you can see it with Grok Zero. Part of what makes Grok really successful [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6065.76s)]
*  is that Elon and only Elon can give access to the X firehose to Grok. Now that's a ginormous [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6072.4800000000005s)]
*  repository of proprietary data that they're going to be able to train on. So then the question is, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6080.64s)]
*  well, obviously then Facebook will want to train their models on Instagram and their models on [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6085.52s)]
*  WhatsApp. Google will want to train Gemini on Gmail. None of those companies will want to make [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6090.0s)]
*  that available to any other model. And so the unfortunate byproduct of a more, of foundational [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6096.48s)]
*  models that are more pervasive is going to be that the internet gets a little bit more closed in the [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6104.08s)]
*  short term. And we're going to have to really figure out what the implications of that are. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6108.72s)]
*  So I think what that means economically is there's just going to be a lot more small companies and a [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6113.04s)]
*  lot fewer of these ginormous outcomes. And that's on balance, probably better for, you know, [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6119.68s)]
*  innovation and the economy, probably. Yeah. Data is the advantage, not the model itself. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6126.08s)]
*  You have to own some data asset that is unique so that you can train these models. And then you [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6131.6s)]
*  have to close it off so nobody else can have access to it. And that has to be an explicit business [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6137.76s)]
*  decision because it would be foolish for you to not do that. Sachs, did you take anything away from [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6142.16s)]
*  this week's announcements with Kaifu, Elon, and OpenAI's Developer Day? [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6148.64s)]
*  Grok is interesting as an AI because it has a sense of humor. I mean, that's what's kind of [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6152.72s)]
*  interesting about the user experience is it tries to be funny. It has a sense of irony. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6157.280000000001s)]
*  It's also willing to be more politically incorrect. And I think one of the concerns [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6162.160000000001s)]
*  about chat GPT early on was that it was programmed to be woke and that it wasn't giving people, [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6166.240000000001s)]
*  you know, truthful answers about a lot of things. That the censorship was being built in [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6172.88s)]
*  to the answers. And there was a lot of examples very early on where it seemed like there was [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6176.56s)]
*  some sort of trust and safety layer that had been built on top of the AI and sometimes it would [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6180.96s)]
*  intervene and not give you the true answer that came from the AI. It would give you kind of some [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6185.52s)]
*  made up boilerplate. And so having something like Grok around will at a minimum keep OpenAI [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6190.72s)]
*  honest and keep, you know, keep chat GPT honest because if it's willing to give you truthful [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6198.160000000001s)]
*  answers about things that you compare to the chat GPT answer, then we're going to know when [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6203.68s)]
*  these like so-called trust and safety interventions are happening. So I think that's kind of interesting. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6208.240000000001s)]
*  Separately, the OpenAI developer day shows that that company, if you want to call it that, [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6214.56s)]
*  I don't know if it's a company or foundation or what, but it's a complicated legal entity. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6221.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, those are details. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6226.64s)]
*  Yeah, those are details. I mean, they are really trucking along at full speed. I mean, [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6229.44s)]
*  it is pretty impressive what they're shipping. And even if the underlying language models get [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6235.92s)]
*  somewhat commoditized, it does seem like they're building a very robust developer ecosystem. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6243.92s)]
*  So you could analogize it to something like Stripe where credit card payments are pretty [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6249.68s)]
*  much a commodity, but everyone uses Stripe because their dev tools are so good. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6254.0s)]
*  Then they're able to get to a bunch of scale network effects because, again, their developer [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6258.96s)]
*  platform is so good. So I do think that that's the advantage of OpenAI may not be the model [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6263.36s)]
*  itself. Although I think their model is actually pretty good, but is it that much better than Lama [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6268.4s)]
*  2? Probably not. But the developer platform is getting really good. By the way, that's a really [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6273.36s)]
*  interesting analogy because if you play that out and you say, is AI like payments? [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6278.64s)]
*  Well, what does the payments landscape look like in terms of companies that have real enterprise [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6284.08s)]
*  value? There are, I guess, three or four big ones. And then there's a bunch of long tail ones in [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6288.32s)]
*  specific geographies because there are these random rules in a country and you build something [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6294.32s)]
*  to be very specific to it. And you have value in that market or in that use case. And maybe there's [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6299.36s)]
*  an analogy there in how this market develops in that sense. There's four or five big foundational [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6306.5599999999995s)]
*  models, and then there's a bunch of small vertical use applications that you use, [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6310.5599999999995s)]
*  depending on what the task is. Well, the time and the cost to build [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6314.16s)]
*  new foundational models seems to be shrinking at a pretty fast clip. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6316.48s)]
*  And by the way, all of this happened on H100s. And a bunch of these happened on A100s. So we're [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6319.839999999999s)]
*  still one generation of Silicon behind. So to your point, this thing is going to be like, [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6327.36s)]
*  people will be training models in weeks. Yeah. So let's go ahead and track all the world's [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6332.32s)]
*  models and have a federal regulatory body overseeing all of this. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6337.04s)]
*  Well, I have a guy from the UK on H1B, so I'm still filling out the TPS report because he, [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6341.44s)]
*  I told him, don't touch the model and he did. Yeah. Yeah, definitely following high level from [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6347.44s)]
*  my perspective. I think it's great, especially with what you mentioned about Kaifuli. It just [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6355.599999999999s)]
*  confirms what we've thought, which is that America is definitely leading in this. And I think that [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6359.599999999999s)]
*  it's just important to note that they're leading, but really because of the private sector and the [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6364.08s)]
*  fact that the private sector has been allowed to do what they do. And as we start to think about [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6367.84s)]
*  the regulatory frameworks, I mean, you could think of OpenAI as a company or a foundation, [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6371.4400000000005s)]
*  or even as a nation state with the amount of power that these things will have the ability to [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6376.24s)]
*  harness once they're fully scaled. And I just think it's going to be very interesting to see. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6381.2s)]
*  I think the more competitive competition you have here, I think the better. It will be very, [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6386.400000000001s)]
*  very good. But I do think you want the most powerful models, the most powerful platforms [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6391.12s)]
*  to be in the hands of people who are going to try to apply it for all the right things for society. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6396.56s)]
*  So I think that there's a lot of positive applications. There's a lot of negative [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6402.96s)]
*  applications that can come from this. And my hope is that the regulatory frameworks that are [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6405.6s)]
*  developed won't stifle innovation at the expense of allowing others to get ahead of us who will [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=6409.92s)]
