# The AI Cold War, Signalgate, CoreWeave IPO, Tariff Endgames, El Salvador Deportations
**All In Podcast:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ)
*  When I wasn't able to use the R word, I would use the defecente for two people, Jason and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Fahmy and Friedberg's dog, Marshall Friedberg. Oh, come on. I can't stand Marshall Friedberg. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=6.24s)]
*  That little bastardino jumps on the table, eats the nuts. The worst. The worst. I ate [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=12.48s)]
*  Marshall Friedberg. I can't stand this bastardino. Look at how he sits. He sits like a moron. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=18.48s)]
*  He sits like a defecente. Look at this dweeb and this defecente. Now, Nick, show them my dogs. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=27.52s)]
*  Beautiful. Beautiful. Valentina Zanini. She's the breeder of breeders. Look at these two beautifully [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=34.4s)]
*  elegant. Look at all these dogs. Look how well behaved they are. You don't see them jumping on [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  the table to eat the main course, Friedberg? No. No. Marshall almost ruined our Christmas dinner. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=45.68s)]
*  This is why I'm holding a real grudge against Marshall Friedberg. He ate two moths nuts. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=50.24s)]
*  No, and Allison, cock Allison off guard. She's like, Marshall Friedberg, get off the table. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=53.92s)]
*  I just love that he's got a full name. Marshall Eugene Friedberg. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=57.84s)]
*  All right, everybody. Welcome back to the number one state sponsor. I'm sorry, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=80.0s)]
*  all in podcast in the world. The number one podcast. Oh, sorry, trade bullets. Here we go. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=84.56s)]
*  Back on the program. Our guy, Gavin Baker is here. You know him from a treaties management, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=89.76s)]
*  does private and public, four billion under management and a lot to talk about with you. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  GB1. Good to have you here. GB1 is here. Solo, dolo, CoreWeave IPO happening soon. By the time [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=100.16s)]
*  you get this and Nvidia, you were there at Nvidia. You are the one analyst, Gavin, that Jensen [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=107.2s)]
*  pulled up. You're loved by Jensen. What's it like to be loved by Jensen? Tell us everything. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=114.24s)]
*  Well, so first thing he did, there was Alfred was from Squia. And then they had a nice sell side guy [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  whose name is escaping me at the moment. But it is technically true. I was the only public equity [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  investor on the buy side that Jensen asked. I've known Jensen for 25 years. He's kind of the same [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=135.92s)]
*  guy he ever was, like just maybe slightly calmer. Gavin, can I ask you like all this stuff where [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=142.8s)]
*  they talk about the balance sheet questions that some folks have about Nvidia, some of the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=148.0s)]
*  accounts receivable issues and stuff? Is there any legitimacy to those issues, the round tripping? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=157.28s)]
*  Like what's the what's the real story of someone that that peers into that PNL and understands it? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so I guess maybe take them in reverse order. I really don't think like if Nvidia had [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=168.48s)]
*  not put any money into core, we've not put any money into kind of other of these Neo clouds. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=175.76s)]
*  I don't think it would have impacted their revenues at all. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=181.44s)]
*  At all. They would have sold more to Meta and more to Tesla, more to Amazon, more to Microsoft. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=186.72s)]
*  So the reason they did it is even three years ago, it was a very stable three player oligopoly [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=194.88s)]
*  from the cloud computing players in Amazon, Google and Microsoft. And if you're Nvidia, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=204.72s)]
*  that's not great to have just three big customers. Those big clouds, particularly in 2023, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  when there was such a rush to get GPUs, they each kind of want to do their own kind of custom [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  version of an Nvidia server. And Nvidia by giving kind of like a standard reference design, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=222.08s)]
*  which someone like Coreweave bought to Coreweave, you got GPUs in the market a lot faster. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=229.2s)]
*  And when you use Nvidia's reference design, it's generally smoother and easier to stand them up. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=234.24s)]
*  And so the big three kind of cloud computing hyperscalers, their incremental share of revenue [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=239.44s)]
*  went down. And that was nothing but good for Nvidia because they now have kind of a more [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=248.8s)]
*  fragmented base of buyers who have less power over them. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  But what does it mean, Gavin, when like the accounts receivable jumps from a billion five [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=258.64s)]
*  or so to like five and a half billion year over year? Is that concerning or that's just business? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=262.72s)]
*  So look, it's never good. But if you think Nvidia has gone through the biggest product [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  transition in history, in terms of Hopper, you know, this is a business doing tens of billions [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=275.44s)]
*  of dollars at scale. There's never been a product transition like this in the history of semiconductors [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=280.48s)]
*  going from Hopper to Blackwell, you know, kind of the 2022 generation GPU to this one. The only [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  precedent for this on planet Earth is the iPhone. And there's something called the Osborne effect, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  which is, you know, when Apple comes out with new iPhone for the three months before, nobody [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  buys the new iPhone. And I think the only reason Nvidia was able to grow through this product [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=304.08s)]
*  transition is because of reasoning models like deep sea, which are just so compute hungry. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=310.88s)]
*  And this product transition does come back to the days receivables. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=315.91999999999996s)]
*  The CUME receivables now is like $23 billion. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=318.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's never good when accounts receivables go up. But if this is the most understandable time [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=322.08s)]
*  for it to happen. In a product refresh cycle, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=329.28s)]
*  you're saying? Yeah. And because a Hopper server, you know, it's a rack, whatever it is, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=332.0s)]
*  seven feet high, weighs a thousand pounds, it consumes 60 kilowatts, which is 60 American [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=337.44s)]
*  homes and it's air cooled. So you cool those GPUs and the biggest problem with GPUs, one of the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=342.32s)]
*  biggest is they melt. You cool it with air. Blackwell, weighs 3000 pounds. So three times [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=347.12s)]
*  as much the rack, you know, it's eight feet tall, maybe five feet deep or four feet deep, 3000 pounds [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=353.92s)]
*  and it consumes 120 kilowatts. So twice as much power and roughly kind of the same footprint, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=360.8s)]
*  three times as much weight and it's liquid cooled. So this is like an iPhone upgrade cycle. You know, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=367.2s)]
*  it was like, it's still a pain that we went from, you know, lightning to USB-C, you know, I'll grab [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=372.8s)]
*  a cord and it'll be lightning instead of USB-C. This is like an iPhone upgrade cycle where to get [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=378.72s)]
*  the new iPhone. Not only do you have to change your connectors, you have to put in a new generator, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=383.6s)]
*  you have to put in a new boiler and a whole house humidification system, you know, to kind of make [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=390.0s)]
*  it work. So it's a monumental product transition and I think that is a lot of why the receivables [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=395.36s)]
*  went up. You know, they're recognizing Blackwell revenue, you know, while it was still kind of [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=405.2s)]
*  getting into customers' hands. If that friend continues past the July quarter, then I would [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=410.96s)]
*  say, hey, that's reason for concern, but this is a very understandable time for that to happen [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  from my perspective. So basically the summary is AR, accounts receivable, builds as you go through [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=426.0s)]
*  this very complicated product transition, but then at some point it peaks and then you start [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=432.47999999999996s)]
*  to work through all of it and it moves off balance sheet, basically gets recognized and you move [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=439.12s)]
*  forward. And so then that AR should shrink. And just to clarify that, that's accounts receivable, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=444.0s)]
*  that's the money owed to you by customers for the audience who might have a question with AR. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=448.4s)]
*  Exactly. And the reason they're not collecting it is because they haven't delivered it. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=452.24s)]
*  I mean, the accounting gets very complicated with these systems, but yes, I mean, they have delivered [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=457.12s)]
*  it and they recognize the revenue, but maybe the customer is saying, hey, we're not going to pay [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=462.56s)]
*  you until X, you know, until we get them plugged in and working. I mean, who knows what it is. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=468.64s)]
*  Got it. Because it's a new thing. Yeah, but it makes total sense to have accounts receivable. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=475.28s)]
*  It's just that here the accounts receivable have gone up more than sales and that's just a function [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=481.28s)]
*  of the complexity of this product transition. The other part of what I would say is the first part [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=486.8s)]
*  of what you're saying is very similar to what Intel did to scale their chip dominance in the 80s and [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=490.8s)]
*  90s with this Intel inside program. They didn't really need to do it probably in hindsight, but [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=496.16s)]
*  it helped them support an ecosystem and it helped diversify their buyer base so that fewer people [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=502.08000000000004s)]
*  had power over them. And so a lot of this quote unquote round tripping from your perspective is [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  diversifying the ownership pool of Nvidia is what you're saying. Absolutely. And sending Nvidia [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=512.4s)]
*  GPUs to people who are adopting Nvidia's reference architecture, which they believe is the best [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=517.52s)]
*  architecture for those GPUs. Whereas each hyperscaler has their own slight tweaks to that server [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=524.08s)]
*  that hyperscaler does it. So it looks more like their other servers, but maybe it doesn't run [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=532.4000000000001s)]
*  quite as well as the standard Nvidia reference architecture with all of their chips, not just [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=537.5200000000001s)]
*  the Nvidia GPUs. But the Intel inside analogy is interesting. I've not thought of that. Thank you, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=542.64s)]
*  Jamal. Well, he is definitely doing keynotes like Intel did and trying to brand the actual names of [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=547.28s)]
*  the units, which is interesting pentium inside people would go and buy a computer. So he doesn't [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=555.68s)]
*  have a pentium and which pentium does it have? And now Apple's doing that same thing with the M4 [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=561.04s)]
*  series and people are actually asking questions. So there is something to it that maybe some [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=566.56s)]
*  portion of the consumer base wants to know what's inside, right? And doesn't cost much to brand. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=572.64s)]
*  Since we're here, let's talk a little bit about the CoreWeave IPO. CoreWeave is going to go [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=578.96s)]
*  public on Friday. We tape on Thursday. So when you listen to this episode, you will have the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=583.28s)]
*  actual data on what happened with their IPO. They're going to raise 1.5 billion. They're a [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=589.52s)]
*  Neo cloud. Neo cloud means not just cloud computing, but a new cloud, thus Neo. And this company [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=593.92s)]
*  has really been growing quickly. It was reported they wanted to raise 2 billion and I guess they [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=600.7199999999999s)]
*  stepped it down to 1.5 billion at a $23 billion valuation. They had 2 billion in revenue last [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=604.88s)]
*  year. So they're up eight acts and they've got a lot of debt. That's the other issue with CoreWeave [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=611.12s)]
*  that people note almost 8 billion in debt. And one customer, Microsoft accounts for over 60% of their [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=615.8399999999999s)]
*  revenue. Always a bit of a red flag there. As Trimoth mentioned, Nvidia accounts for 15% of [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=621.92s)]
*  their revenue and they own 6%. 6% seems small enough to not make a difference. So Gavin, I guess [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=627.28s)]
*  what do you make of this company CoreWeave and their timing, what it says about the markets? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=633.36s)]
*  Because hey, this is the biggest IPO we've had in a bit. I think maybe the last ones that were [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=637.76s)]
*  notable were Reddit last year and a couple of other companies got out. Obviously Stripe hasn't [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=643.12s)]
*  gotten out. So is this a major milestone or are they going out because they have to go out because [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=648.0799999999999s)]
*  of all this debt? And then this is all against maybe a backdrop of did we overbuild and are [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=654.08s)]
*  these language models going to require as much hardware as we thought last year? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=661.5200000000001s)]
*  So we're definitely not overbuilt yet. Like since DeepSeq came out, like what has happened since [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=667.76s)]
*  DeepSeq R1 came out is China is buying every GPU they can. One of the largest Chinese server [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=674.1600000000001s)]
*  manufacturers warned last night that there's about to be a shortage of GPUs in China. The [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=680.48s)]
*  price of memory DRAM goes up every day. So we're not overbuilt today. Point number one, and you [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=686.64s)]
*  know OpenAI yesterday said that they are gating their new image generation service because they [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=695.9200000000001s)]
*  don't have enough GPUs. So we're not overbuilt yet. Blackwell is going to be a very successful [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=700.96s)]
*  product cycle. There is a little bit of a prisoner's dilemma where you're going to spend on [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=705.92s)]
*  Blackwell almost no matter what because if you don't, you're afraid that you cede a big advantage [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=711.76s)]
*  to a competitor. You know, if you're meta and you don't spend and Google spends and their AI is a [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=716.56s)]
*  lot better than yours, you're worried you may not catch up. I would say that that's already the case. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=721.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's already the case. But here this is a brand new architecture, which is a lot. I mean, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=725.8399999999999s)]
*  it not only is it really different as we went through, it is a lot better. But I would say all [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=731.52s)]
*  these GPUs, they're hard to get them working at the beginning. Like right now, hoppers are, you [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=736.3199999999999s)]
*  know, finely tuned. Everybody knows how to work with them. Blackwell, you know, it's almost like [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=741.76s)]
*  you're you're skipping ahead. You know, it's like, imagine each one of these GPUs is a Formula One [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=746.8s)]
*  car. You know, now you skipped ahead 10 years in the future and you have to kind of learn how to [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=752.24s)]
*  drive that new Formula One car. And it takes a while till you drive it as well as the old one. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=756.16s)]
*  So any other thoughts Gavin on the CoreWeave IPO, which will have happened by the time people [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=761.04s)]
*  listen to this episode? Yeah, I would say, you know, the sentiment on X investors on X are pretty [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=766.4s)]
*  negative on CoreWeave. I think there's maybe a little bit of, you know, negativity in the market. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=772.48s)]
*  They had to, you know, reduce the range, lower the price. And everyone is very convinced this is a [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=776.7199999999999s)]
*  commodity business loads of debt loads of capex, you know, are one really concentrated customer, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=782.24s)]
*  and that they're completely undifferentiated. And I guess I would just make a point, which is [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=788.4000000000001s)]
*  in America, if you can pick any category, any retail category, and if you can run 1000 stores [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=794.1600000000001s)]
*  in 50 different states with different preferences, and have those stores well lit, clean, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=801.6800000000001s)]
*  stocked by friendly employees with the right stuff in stock, you will create a business that is worth, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=807.9200000000001s)]
*  you know, well over $10 billion. And that sounds easy, but very few companies have been able to do [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=814.0s)]
*  it. I think what may be underappreciated about CoreWeave is it's actually really hard to run [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=819.68s)]
*  these big training clusters. Everybody thinks it's easy, but synchronize tens of thousands of GPUs [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=826.88s)]
*  where they're melting or cables are being unplugged. And you know, you lose a bunch of training data [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=834.56s)]
*  when it happens. I just think it's not. It may not be the commodity that everyone thinks it is, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=840.16s)]
*  and it may turn out that it's much harder to do than people think. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=847.1999999999999s)]
*  Will there be an analogy for that? When they're like people thought AWS would never work at the [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=851.04s)]
*  beginning, they were like, who's going to trust Amazon with their compute? And it was difficult. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=856.0s)]
*  And, you know, developers didn't understand exactly how to abstract their services into the cloud. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=860.8s)]
*  Yeah, the world was convinced AWS, well, a lot of the world was convinced AWS was a terrible [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=866.64s)]
*  business for the first few years. You know, when Microsoft announced they're going to transition [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=871.1999999999999s)]
*  to the cloud, it was very controversial because you go from a CapEx light model to a CapEx heavy [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=874.72s)]
*  model. So, you know, Wall Street consensus has been wrong before. And I do think CoreWeave runs [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=879.92s)]
*  these big GPU clusters as well as anyone. And there aren't that many people on planet Earth [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=886.48s)]
*  who can run them well. And, you know, it's kind of easy. You can just look at the NPV of their [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=892.32s)]
*  contracts and the asset value. And so everyone, you know, who's kind of, you know, confidently [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=897.84s)]
*  putting out all the negatives here, like, I just think there are some offsetting positives that [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=903.6s)]
*  it's good for, you know, I think people to be aware of and consider. That's all. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=908.72s)]
*  I think it's a good company. I would second. I mean, I think it's a great business and I think [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=913.36s)]
*  they deserve to be successful. Totally true. And it's great to see a competitor to the existing [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=918.88s)]
*  three or four clouds that are out there. And it's great to see a company go public. I mean, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=925.04s)]
*  M&A with Wiz and now CoreWeave going public. Rathalina Khan is over. We got to give the [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=929.68s)]
*  administration a lot of credit for maybe removing the roadblocks to M&A and IPOs, or at least [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=934.88s)]
*  people perceive that. So I don't know if perception becomes reality here, but [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=941.68s)]
*  does seem like M&A is a bit on fire again, and people are talking. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=945.84s)]
*  Above and beyond Wiz and CoreWeave bought Weights and Biases, which I think is a really [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=949.6s)]
*  interesting acquisition for them that kind of kind of further differentiates them and maybe [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=953.2s)]
*  decommodifies them a little bit. But there have been quite a few acquisitions by big companies [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=957.4399999999999s)]
*  of smaller companies in the last month. And I think because none of the companies that have [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=962.96s)]
*  been bought have been public. Maybe it's flying a little under the radar, but it's happening in an, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=966.88s)]
*  and I think, you know, an accelerating way. And I think this would be, you know, very good for the [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=971.68s)]
*  market and animal spirits and everything that we care about. Do you think that there's any issues? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=976.88s)]
*  There was a bunch of companies added to the export control list two days ago. Some were in quantum [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=983.68s)]
*  computing. Generally, a lot of it though was in the Nvidia ecosystem. So I think that the [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=989.04s)]
*  US government is really trying to make sure that these next gen GPUs don't go directly to China, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=994.3199999999999s)]
*  but also don't go to countries that could then redirect them into China. Did you get a chance [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=998.88s)]
*  to look at that? Or did your team look at that? Oh, yeah. And I think this will be part of, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1002.88s)]
*  you know, the upcoming negotiation between America and China, but it is hard. You know, it's, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1008.0s)]
*  if we can't, you know, if America cannot keep illegal drugs out of, you know, out of our own [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1014.16s)]
*  country, these GPUs are arguably dramatically more valuable per unit. You know, like a Blackwell is [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1020.96s)]
*  like, you know, the size of this, and it's just hard, particularly like, you know, America, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1029.3600000000001s)]
*  we're trying to keep drugs out. Here, China is trying to bring the GPUs in, and it's kind of [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1036.24s)]
*  significantly, you know, I think harder to prevent than, than, you know, smuggling of illegal drugs. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1044.0s)]
*  Now, everybody does their best. But yeah, the United States, I think it's always going to be [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1049.84s)]
*  kind of a game of cat and mouse until you get some sort of grand bargain. And right now they're [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1055.36s)]
*  allowed to sell certain kinds of GPUs into China, and I'm sure they'll be. Should we be doing that, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1060.48s)]
*  Gavin? Is this going to be an effective strategy? You know, if you were advising the president, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1065.1999999999998s)]
*  would you say, ah, just let Nvidia sell them? It's a fool's errand to try to stop them because [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1070.56s)]
*  they're all going to Singapore or wherever Vietnam and routing their way around. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1074.88s)]
*  I think we're putting enough friction into the system that it does theoretically give [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1079.8400000000001s)]
*  America an advantage at the cost of creating tremendous incentives for China to develop their [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1087.6000000000001s)]
*  own semiconductor ecosystem. And, you know, pressure to kind of, you know, necessity is [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1096.3200000000002s)]
*  the mother of innovation. And these export controls are creating an immense incentive [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1103.12s)]
*  for China to be really algorithmically innovative. And you saw that with DeepSeek [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1108.7199999999998s)]
*  where there were some real algorithmic innovations. Yeah. So you said another way, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1112.3999999999999s)]
*  if we squeeze too tightly on letting them buy the Nvidia chips, they might make a better Nvidia. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1118.08s)]
*  I mean, I think that would be resilient. I think they're doing it now. They're trying now. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1124.4799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. So that's well, they're trying, but I guess what are the chances they succeed in your mind, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1127.84s)]
*  Gavin, in creating something competitive with or better? And then what would that say about the AI [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1131.84s)]
*  race? In the next five years, I think zero. I think it's really, really hard. But over the 10 years, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1137.4399999999998s)]
*  who knows? And if you're the CCP, 10 years isn't that long. If you're America, 10 years is an [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1143.76s)]
*  eternity. Yeah, they're thinking in centuries. And we're thinking in decades. Yeah, that's [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1149.04s)]
*  probably correct. Hey, let's pivot over to AI agents since we're in the AI. And obviously, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1154.32s)]
*  there's other big topics this week we'll get to, you know, in politics and signal and all that [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1160.16s)]
*  kind of good stuff. But we have a company that seems to be, you know, having a moment, it's [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1164.72s)]
*  called Manus, M-A-N-U-S. It's currently in private beta, but they're creating agents. And we've been [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1173.2s)]
*  talking about this agentic revolution, basically little, you know, jobs going out and used to call [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1179.68s)]
*  them Cron jobs back in the day, but going out and doing things for you. And it seems to be working [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1186.16s)]
*  and it's pretty impressive. What do you think about this company specifically, if anything? And are we [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1190.8000000000002s)]
*  getting to a point where we're going to have the same chat GPT 2.5 moment, but with agents? And then [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1197.6000000000001s)]
*  if we do have that, Gavin, what will that look like in terms of employment and how companies are run? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1204.5600000000002s)]
*  Look, I do think if agents materialize as a reality and, you know, Manus is maybe a little [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1210.56s)]
*  bit of a chat GPT moment for that. I would say OpenAI and Anthropic, Anthropic develops something [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1217.9199999999998s)]
*  called the model context protocol that OpenAI just adopted. I think it will become a standard [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1224.24s)]
*  and it makes it really easy for an LLM like Stripe can just integrate with MCP. And then any LLM that [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1229.12s)]
*  uses MCP can, you know, interact with Stripe. And this is solving a big, big problem for agents [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1237.84s)]
*  in terms of just making them, you know, much easier to use, much more standardized. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1246.6399999999999s)]
*  But if agents become a reality, one, the ROI on AI and Blackwell is going to be very high. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1252.8s)]
*  And two, what will, it's not good for human employment, but what will be kind of, I would [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1259.76s)]
*  say the rate limiting factor is just compute. In a world where we all have agents doing things for us [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1267.28s)]
*  all day long, it's going to be a long time before we have enough compute in the ground for that to [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1274.72s)]
*  be a really, really widespread reality. And I think that's why, you know, OpenAI is talking about [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1281.84s)]
*  pricing their first agents at 2000 to $20,000 a month. Like this ROI on AI question, I think to [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1287.12s)]
*  me really does come down to agents in the short term. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1292.88s)]
*  Freeburg, your thoughts on these agents and the impact they could have on running businesses, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1295.92s)]
*  employment, and just generally efficiency. We now starting to have some standards, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1302.88s)]
*  MCP stands for model context protocol. Your thoughts, Freeburg, on how this might impact, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1307.44s)]
*  you know, architecting a business, which you're doing right now with Ohalo. How might this change [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1313.7600000000002s)]
*  how people work on a day to day basis? Let's maybe give some examples for the audience. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1318.16s)]
*  Look, I'll take a slightly different view than Gavin. I've said this in the past, but maybe I'll [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1323.1200000000001s)]
*  try and contextualize it a little bit. I think that the big unlock with these kind of agentic [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1328.5600000000002s)]
*  systems is not necessarily about replacing the easy human tasks, which everyone kind of thinks are [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1336.3200000000002s)]
*  kind of the obvious application of them. I think what we're missing is the ability to unlock really [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1343.92s)]
*  complex tasks that are not really manageable today. I can't come up with a very grand project [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1352.4s)]
*  planning exercise with the team I have today. I have to go hire 30 people. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1363.2800000000002s)]
*  Let me give you an example. I want to go build a plant breeding facility under the ocean. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1367.68s)]
*  Okay. So how do I do that? So to do that today, I'm like, well, I got to go hire people that [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1373.92s)]
*  understand oceans, I understand engineering, that understand how to do underwater engineering. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1378.32s)]
*  I have to hire material scientists. I have to hire physicists. I have to hire construction [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1383.6799999999998s)]
*  project planners. There's a whole group of complicated people I would need to kind of [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1388.0s)]
*  put together to be able to kind of execute on that opportunity. But now a smaller group, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1391.6799999999998s)]
*  maybe three or four people or two people can say, okay, let's use these agents to help us build that [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1397.36s)]
*  project plan and spec out every step of the process, define how much everything will cost, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1402.0s)]
*  what workloads are needed, who's going to do what. So suddenly that difficult project becomes a [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1407.6s)]
*  reality. Here's another good example, the California high speed rail program that's ballooned to this [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1412.24s)]
*  hundred billion dollar. What if we had agents organizing and running that program? Well, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1416.56s)]
*  maybe the cost of that program, the reality of that program makes it a reality now. So it suddenly [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1421.12s)]
*  becomes a program that we launch, we get it done, we build this railroad, whereas all the people, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1426.56s)]
*  all the complication, all the confusion has, and whatever grift has been going on, has led to a [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1431.04s)]
*  hundred billion dollar balloon budget with no outcome. So I think complex projects can actually [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1436.16s)]
*  be tackled in an easier way. That actually unlocks a tremendous amount of building, a tremendous [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1441.28s)]
*  amount of opportunity for new employment, for people to come in and small teams of three or [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1446.3200000000002s)]
*  four to get hired. They can now do the work of three or four hundred really deeply sophisticated, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1451.6000000000001s)]
*  highly technical people with a very small, less technical group. So I think there's going to be a [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1456.5600000000002s)]
*  tremendous amount of opportunity in biotech, in engineering, in manufacturing, in urban design, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1460.96s)]
*  in transportation, and on and on and on where small groups are going to get spun up that can [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1471.3600000000001s)]
*  use these systems to do really complex projects. It's less about like, oh, you're going to replace [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1475.76s)]
*  call centers. Like, sure, maybe, but like, what are we going to be able to do with these things [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1480.4s)]
*  that I can't even think about doing today? Chamath, let's level this up and just talk [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1484.32s)]
*  about the bigger picture, which is our giant rival in China. They're actually catching up, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1488.56s)]
*  in some cases, exceeding us. If they get to AI first, and then are able to execute on this, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1495.84s)]
*  given their top down controls, given the size of their population, given their advantages in [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1502.0s)]
*  manufacturing that we're seeing now with Xiaomi making cars. You know what BYD is doing in [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1507.44s)]
*  self-driving in cars, what we're seeing now with chips versus Nvidia, it's kind of getting set up [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1515.84s)]
*  that almost everything we're building here in the US, China's copying at a very fast pace, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1521.36s)]
*  and then exceeding. So what's at stake here, big picture, and then I guess we'll then look at [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1526.0s)]
*  why what should our, what should our philosophy be, you know, in a geopolitical way? Yeah, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1531.6799999999998s)]
*  let's just do an economics lesson. Why does anybody invest? They invest because you, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1537.1999999999998s)]
*  let's just take a dollar. You want to generate a rate of return that's better than all your [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1543.44s)]
*  alternatives. And the riskier it gets, the more of a return you want, right? That's the basic idea. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1549.1200000000001s)]
*  So if you invest a dollar in bonds, you can get five or 6%. If you invest a [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1554.72s)]
*  dollar in an early stage startup, you want to get 50 or 60% returns. Okay, that's obvious. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1559.2s)]
*  But the return that you generate is in part driven by how profitable is this company, obviously. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1565.52s)]
*  And if you have a 300 person group of people that has to do something, it's a lot harder for them [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1572.48s)]
*  to generate profit and then to generate a rate of return than it is if you have two or three people. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1578.24s)]
*  So the Chinese strategic imperative is no different than small startups versus an incumbent, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1584.3999999999999s)]
*  which is to be as hyper disruptive economically as you can. So I think the big risk [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1593.28s)]
*  is not necessarily Chinese, but many of these alternatives will come from China, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1601.5200000000002s)]
*  which is to say that where are the incumbents? Most of the incumbents are American companies. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1606.48s)]
*  If you look at SaaS software, that's a perfect example of where there's trillions of dollars, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1613.5200000000002s)]
*  the software industrial complex, as I call it, right? That's like a three and a half, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1618.72s)]
*  four trillion dollar industry. It grows by 10% a year. So every year, it's adding 300 billion [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1623.8400000000001s)]
*  of quote unquote enterprise value. Is that value that is being created? I think a lot of the [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1631.1200000000001s)]
*  customers would say no. So if you're a startup, or if you're China, what is the most disruptive [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1637.68s)]
*  thing you could do? Well, you could take a three person team to disrupt a 30,000 person team and [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1644.8000000000002s)]
*  blow a hole right in the side of that three trillion dollar economy. That's the big risk. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1650.0800000000002s)]
*  So whether the risk comes from here, whether it comes from the Chinese, I think what you're [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1655.1200000000001s)]
*  seeing is that if these agents can scale the apex, the actual load of making something will [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1659.36s)]
*  go down by an order of magnitude. And that is, and maybe even two orders of magnitude, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1666.8s)]
*  that is incredibly disruptive because the existing incumbents cannot compete with that cost scale. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1672.1599999999999s)]
*  And Gavin, to just bring this around the horn here, China is playing a different game. And [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1679.36s)]
*  obviously, there's other competitors on a global basis, but they are subsidizing, for example, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1685.52s)]
*  their cars and their entire car industry. So the margin of cars here in the United States, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1689.3600000000001s)]
*  in Germany and Japan, that's their opportunity. They don't actually need to make a profit on it. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1694.8s)]
*  They just break even. There are cars now 10, 20, 30, 40 thousand dollars cars now being made there. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1698.96s)]
*  So this then leads us to, oh my goodness, will Americans buy these were pretty great customer, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1704.88s)]
*  will Trump block them with tariffs? So let's make the jump. What would the tariff policy be if, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1711.92s)]
*  as Chamath points out here, we've got this big broad side of our battleship that they can put [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1718.8000000000002s)]
*  a giant hole through, which is our software industry, our car industry, pick an industry [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1723.76s)]
*  that they might be able to just blow a hole in because they don't need to make a profit. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1730.8000000000002s)]
*  They just need to have jobs and break even. What should our tariff policy be? Or what is it? I [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1734.0800000000002s)]
*  mean, we know what it is, Brados. It's 25%. Do we know what it is? It seems like it's influx. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1740.56s)]
*  So maybe we start there. What should the policy be? What do you perceive the policy is? Because [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1745.44s)]
*  it does seem to be a moving target. We'll see what happens on April 2nd because Trump keeps tweaking, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1752.08s)]
*  let's say, adjusting in public. Yeah. I mean, this is so traditional economics would say, hey, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1757.76s)]
*  tariffs are not a good idea. We should have free trade. Everybody understands the principle of [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1767.44s)]
*  comparative advantage. I do think the Trump administration is pretty convicted that that [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1771.68s)]
*  approach has not worked well for America over the last 20 years. And maybe it's worked well for [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1777.76s)]
*  knowledge workers, but it hasn't worked well for ordinary Americans. And I think they're very [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1784.8s)]
*  convicted in changing that and trying to bring back good, high-quality manufacturing jobs to America. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1790.0s)]
*  I think they see tariffs as an effective way to do that. Are they right? Is it going to be because [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1796.48s)]
*  a lot of what we're seeing in factories is automation. So while they may have been right [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1802.0s)]
*  about tariffs, bringing back high paying middle class jobs for the past 20 years, we cannot go in [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1807.1200000000001s)]
*  a time machine and change that policy. And isn't where the pucks going that we're going to have [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1812.08s)]
*  optimist robots, figure robots, pick a robot company, doing all this work. Here's what tariffs [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1816.64s)]
*  do. Tariffs are a level setting mechanism that fixes a historical imbalance. Look, the reality [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1821.36s)]
*  is that we have had meaningfully lower tariffs for products coming in than those reciprocal tariffs [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1830.24s)]
*  exist for our products going into these other countries. That's true. And the one thing I'll [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1838.4799999999998s)]
*  say about Donald Trump is you may not agree with the tariffs, but he's been incredibly consistent. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1845.12s)]
*  I was on YouTube yesterday and I stumbled into an interview he did, Nick, maybe you can find this, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1850.32s)]
*  with Larry King in 1987. And he ran a full page ad in the New York Times talking about this exact [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1858.3999999999999s)]
*  issue and then went on Larry King and he walked through the entire trade imbalance 40 years ago. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1865.84s)]
*  Yeah, he's been on this. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1871.9199999999998s)]
*  So this is not a fly by night thing. So what do they want? What they want is to create the [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1873.52s)]
*  economic incentives to reshore as much industry as possible into the United States. The delicate [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1879.84s)]
*  balancing act though is that after 20 years of globalism and a perverted version of free trade, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1887.9199999999998s)]
*  because it's not what it is today, it's been perverted. It is incredibly difficult to do that [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1895.9199999999998s)]
*  without these whack-a-mole problems emerging in other areas, right? Whether it's inflation [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1901.36s)]
*  or whether it's retaliatory tariffs or consumption taxes, all of these complexities, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1907.52s)]
*  I think, are what has to get figured out. But the structural reason of why tariffs make sense [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1912.48s)]
*  is not necessarily to overly penalize one country over another, but it's simply to say, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1917.76s)]
*  if you charge 5%, we charge 5%. If you charge 10%, we charge 10%. Nick has a clip. Just listen to [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1923.28s)]
*  this from 40 years ago. We don't have free trade right now because if you want to go to Japan or [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1928.8799999999999s)]
*  if you want to go to Saudi Arabia or various other countries, it's virtually impossible for [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1932.72s)]
*  an American to do business in those countries, virtually impossible. So the fact is that you [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1936.56s)]
*  don't have free trade. We think of it as free trade, but you right now don't have free trade. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1941.12s)]
*  So Gavin, let's get back to this original question with Chamath's important context. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1945.28s)]
*  Trump has been on this for a while, but is this where the puck's going? We have the lowest [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1950.48s)]
*  unemployment of our lifetime. Wages are obviously not where we want them to be. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1956.32s)]
*  Is the right solution to put in a bunch of tariffs, create trade wars, and then hope that people [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1960.72s)]
*  are going to build factories that employ humans when in fact it probably will be robots? Is there [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1966.8799999999999s)]
*  another solution like maybe raising the minimum wage? I don't know. What are your thoughts? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1974.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, one, I think it's Chamath and that clip illustrated. He is convicted in this. It's 40 [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1978.1599999999999s)]
*  years old. It's happening. Yeah, it's happening. And so I would say two things. One, I think it's [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1983.6799999999998s)]
*  something I'm always conscious of. My wife, Becky, one of her college or high school reunions, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1990.16s)]
*  there's a guy there who'd been in our class and had been in the Navy SEALs and he deployed to 80 [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=1998.96s)]
*  countries. He'd been in the Navy SEALs for like a decade. And I said, what's the one thing that you [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2002.96s)]
*  learned? And he said, the one thing I learned is everybody in America is always focused on making [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2007.76s)]
*  America better. Have you been to 80 different places all around the world? Our only goal should [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2013.92s)]
*  be to not screw it up in America. Just don't make it worse because America is so much better than [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2020.48s)]
*  everywhere else. So the first thing is like, you know, Chamath said the word delicate and I think [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2025.8400000000001s)]
*  that's right. And if I had one thought for the administration, it would be every time they say [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2030.24s)]
*  the word tariff, whatever they think, Wall Street in the markets. And I would say, you know, I think [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2036.16s)]
*  a lot of business leaders are convinced that tariffs are bad. Now, maybe Wall Street is wrong [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2041.52s)]
*  and the administration is right. One thing everyone agrees on is deregulation is good. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2046.48s)]
*  So every time they say the word tariff, they need to say the word deregulation two or three times, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2051.2s)]
*  because the best way to, I think, maximize the odds of this policy succeeding, despite the headwinds [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2057.04s)]
*  from automation, I think it's going to be a long time before we have hundreds of millions of robots. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2064.0s)]
*  Even between China and Tesla, I think it's going to take a long time to make vast numbers of humanoid [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2069.3599999999997s)]
*  robots. The best way to encourage this reshoring is just making it easier to do business in America. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2074.7999999999997s)]
*  Okay, 100%. Can I just add one thing? That's really, really important what Gavin said. There's [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2081.8399999999997s)]
*  a third thing I would add Gavin to your list, which is we need to figure out the difference [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2086.56s)]
*  between manufacturing and IP. And I think what we want to do is make sure that we trap the real [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2091.2799999999997s)]
*  value back in America as well. Look, I've told you guys this story before, but [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2097.2s)]
*  when I was helping to run Facebook, I was a signatory. When we were setting up Facebook [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2101.7599999999998s)]
*  abroad, we exported all of our IP to Ireland. And lo and behold, who do they sue? Zuck, Meta, and me. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2105.7599999999998s)]
*  And we've been in this 10 year lawsuit, 15 year lawsuit with the IRS because they're trying to [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2116.8799999999997s)]
*  come back and say, Hey, Facebook, you owe all of this money. Why? Because we exported all of [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2122.4s)]
*  our critical IP to Ireland and we trapped it there. That should not have been able to happen. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2128.64s)]
*  We can fix it. Separately, there's many companies who are abroad who live inside the American [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2133.76s)]
*  market who have given a mechanism would import their IP into the United States if there was a [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2139.84s)]
*  mechanism to do so. So not only can you have manufacturing, you can also have the critical [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2143.76s)]
*  knowledge, not just of that manufacturing, but of that product of that supply chain. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2148.64s)]
*  Those are the incentives that these nuances, if we get right, it's really a renaissance for [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2152.8799999999997s)]
*  the United States. Let's talk a little bit about maybe other solutions. Friedberg, obviously, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2157.44s)]
*  perhaps raising the minimum wage or increasing corporate taxes in order to do that. Would that [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2164.3199999999997s)]
*  not also help us maybe build back the middle class? That is the criticism I think some other people [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2169.6s)]
*  have. Trump, when he did his TCGA, as people remember the Tax, Fett, and Jobs Act, corporate [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2176.8s)]
*  tax rate was 35%. We put it down to 21%. And now repatriation of cash from overseas, as Jamat's [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2183.52s)]
*  pointing out, I think it's only 15%. It's like everybody can kind of afford that. So would that [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2189.6800000000003s)]
*  not be another way to solve this problem of the bottom half, the bottom third, not making enough, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2195.36s)]
*  or maybe even lowering their tax rate, which is already pretty low? [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2200.96s)]
*  Well, I think the proposal that I've heard from this administration, that we heard from Howard [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2207.36s)]
*  Lutnick, when we met with him was they're going to cut all taxes for people making less than [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2213.1200000000003s)]
*  $150,000 a year. So get the tax rate to zero. Do you believe that? Do you think it's realistic [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2217.84s)]
*  now that it's a week after you do that? You actually think that can happen? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2224.2400000000002s)]
*  I 100% do. And I think- [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2227.28s)]
*  In what timeline and why? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2229.04s)]
*  Well, that's the key question. This is where this becomes like a first and second derivative [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2231.1200000000003s)]
*  problem. Let's just talk about it this way. When you take money out of the economy, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2235.52s)]
*  you want to make sure you're also putting money back into the economy in another way to keep the [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2240.4s)]
*  economy stable or growing. So if you're taking money out of the economy, in the case of tariffs, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2244.56s)]
*  you're putting money into the government's coffers. You're reducing people's spending [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2250.96s)]
*  because everything costs more now. So consumers will spend less. So what you want to do is you [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2256.56s)]
*  want to make sure that the money that you're repatriating is going back to the consumers so [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2261.28s)]
*  they can now have more money to spend. So that's why you want to cut taxes at the same time that [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2265.84s)]
*  you're increasing the tariff rates. So if you increase the tariff rates, things cost more. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2270.48s)]
*  The government is now making things more expensive. That's not good. But at the same time, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2274.96s)]
*  if I cut your taxes and you got more money now than you did before, so you can now buy the things [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2279.92s)]
*  that you were buying, even though they're a little more expensive, the economy should be able to [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2284.1600000000003s)]
*  remain stable or grow. At the same time, if you're cutting government spending, that means [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2288.08s)]
*  that the government can afford to take less taxes in. And so they can make that assessment. So these [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2293.7599999999998s)]
*  are all, we've said it many times, these are all very related. And to Gavin's point, you've got to [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2300.56s)]
*  cut regulation at the same time so that the incremental dollars flow into things like [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2305.44s)]
*  automation, onshore productions, that the cost of things come down. And so again, not a simple [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2310.3199999999997s)]
*  equation. I would call it a grand economic experiment. The analogy for me feels a little [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2316.48s)]
*  bit like there's four freight trains kind of passing by each other at very high speed. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2321.36s)]
*  And you're trying to pass all the ingredients to make a sandwich between the windows of the freight [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2325.44s)]
*  trains, you're trying to get them all over so you can make this delicious sandwich and get to this [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2329.44s)]
*  golden age. That's the configuration that it feels like they need to kind of assess as they're [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2332.72s)]
*  and they're iteratively. They have to thread the needle is I think your point. And it's really hard [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2338.08s)]
*  to do. And you use the phrase experiment, Gavin, you said before, hey, don't screw up this amazing [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2342.96s)]
*  country and what we've got here. This sounds like a very high risk, you know, high dexterity [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2350.64s)]
*  maneuver. It feels like a fighter plane, like trying to land on, you know, a very small, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2356.64s)]
*  you know, aircraft carrier, can they pull this off? Can they get to the tariffs working at the same [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2363.44s)]
*  time, inflation not spiking, not impacting employment, getting rid of people's taxes? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2369.04s)]
*  Does this sound too complex to you and too much too fast? What is your honest thought, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2374.8s)]
*  Gavin, as you watch this as a capital allocator, are they going too hard too fast? Or is it [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2379.6s)]
*  worth pursuing this experiment as as free bird framed it? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2383.6s)]
*  Look, Scott Bessent is probably the single most respected or was the single most respected [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2387.68s)]
*  macro investor in the world. Like he really understands the markets, how they flow through [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2392.8s)]
*  to policy, how policy flows back. He's extremely smart, talented guy. They have a coherent theory. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2397.68s)]
*  You know, I thought Howard and Scott did a great job in the last two episodes. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2405.7599999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2410.48s)]
*  Him kind of explaining the theory. And the one thing I would just say, having, you know, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2411.04s)]
*  we all watch the first Trump administration, he is adaptable. He adapts to circumstances. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2415.9199999999996s)]
*  And the midterms now are whatever they are, you know, in political terms, they're 15 months [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2421.6s)]
*  away from, you know, around the corner. Yeah, around the corner. So I think they're trying [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2429.44s)]
*  to do a lot as quickly as they can. But I also think that if after a few months, it's, you know, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2434.56s)]
*  six months, nine months, it's not working, they will adapt. And I think that's one reason [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2443.76s)]
*  there's such an emphasis on reciprocity. You know, in Vietnam came out and they lowered their [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2449.2799999999997s)]
*  tariffs on American goods. And that's good. And so I think the out is, oh, you know, maybe it's not [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2454.0s)]
*  going quite the way we hoped. We're going to declare kind of, hey, we have a series of grand [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2461.68s)]
*  bargains with these countries, declare victory. Maybe tariffs on American goods are slightly lower, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2466.3999999999996s)]
*  tariffs here are slightly higher, feels more fair. And, you know, move on to kind of firmer [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2472.56s)]
*  ground of kind of deregulation, balancing the budget, cutting government spending, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2479.2799999999997s)]
*  and cutting government taxes, commensurate with the spending cuts. So I think they're trying the [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2485.12s)]
*  risky stuff first. And if it doesn't work, they will attack quickly. Yeah, that was my perception, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2490.08s)]
*  especially after hearing Basant on the all in pod, great job, guys on getting those long form. And [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2495.92s)]
*  I think this is where the administration is strong. It's when they do a long form discussion and you [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2500.96s)]
*  hear their thoughts about it. It doesn't sound as crazy as when, you know, all due respect to the [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2504.48s)]
*  president, when the president is like, I'm going to go easy on them, I'm going to go hard on them, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2510.32s)]
*  you know, and it's like a reality TV show, and who's going to get fired this week. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2513.52s)]
*  You actually have two incredibly thoughtful, I will point out Democrats, lifelong Democrats [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2517.28s)]
*  around Trump. And I think that's like a really, I had this crazy observation, Gavin, I don't know [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2521.84s)]
*  if you noticed it as well. You know, Trump lost his reelection campaign, and he filled his whole [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2526.64s)]
*  cabinet with a bunch of Republicans. This time he's filled this whole cabinet and everybody around [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2532.24s)]
*  him is a Democrat. And he's gone to a really unique concept here of how to solve the US's problems, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2536.3199999999997s)]
*  which is get the working man and woman a higher salary, and lower their taxes. This this could be [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2543.3599999999997s)]
*  like an incredible grand bargain that the cent I think is the architect of and let Nick is, you [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2550.3199999999997s)]
*  know, the communicator and executor of you think they have a chance of pulling this off? What do [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2556.72s)]
*  you have to handicap it? I hope they do as an American, I hope they do. I think they for sure [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2561.9199999999996s)]
*  have a chance of doing it. They have a solid theory of the case. They need to execute well. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2566.64s)]
*  I would say Doge's efforts are important. You know, if you can really cut a trillion dollars of kind [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2572.08s)]
*  of waste, fraud and abuse out of the government, government spending, that's good. You know, we [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2577.2s)]
*  should all agree as Americans, you know, maybe Democrats, they want more government spending, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2582.48s)]
*  maybe Republicans want less, but for whatever given level of government spending, we want it to be as [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2586.72s)]
*  efficient as possible. Because if you're a Democrat, that means more services. If you're [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2590.8s)]
*  Republican, maybe that means a smaller government. So I think they have a solid theory of the case. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2594.7200000000003s)]
*  I think there's a reasonable chance it will succeed. But if it doesn't, I think they will attack [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2599.6800000000003s)]
*  quickly. And the one thing they can't afford is a recession. If they're focused on the deficit, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2605.2000000000003s)]
*  deficit, a recession blows out the deficit. So they will be ultimately sensitive to these market [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2609.44s)]
*  based forces, you know, rates, stock markets, the foreign currency markets. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2616.32s)]
*  Aaron Norris Traynham, you want to maybe wrap this up for us here as we move on to some of [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2622.48s)]
*  the other topics of the week. John Arnold had a post this morning on X. He was saying the [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2627.36s)]
*  deficit this year is going to be 1.9 trillion. His best guess for 2026 was 1.9 trillion. And he [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2633.36s)]
*  was just kind of asking his followers what they thought. If you listen to Howard last week, what [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2638.8s)]
*  he said is, I'm going to raise a trillion dollars and Elon's going to cut a trillion. Now, if that [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2644.4s)]
*  comes to pass, then we have a balanced budget. If you ask the sharp money on Wall Street, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2651.2000000000003s)]
*  their numbers range from 170 billion to 300 billion on the revenue side. So let's take the [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2659.52s)]
*  midpoint of around 200 to 250 billion. If the sharp money is right, that means that [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2666.64s)]
*  tariffs and all of that stuff will only really raise a quarter of a trillion, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2673.68s)]
*  which means that there's going to be even more pressure on Elon. He's going to have to find not [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2678.3199999999997s)]
*  one trillion, but 1.75 trillion. Again, assuming that that 1.9 trillion dollar deficit exists next [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2682.24s)]
*  year. So that's the math. It is a two trillion dollar bogey, and they have to fill it somehow. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2689.68s)]
*  My intuition is that the waste, fraud and abuse is probably meaningfully more significant than we [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2695.68s)]
*  think. When we were there, we heard about one consulting firm, 95 plus of all of their revenue, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2703.28s)]
*  multi-billion dollar revenue comes from time and materials contracts with the United States [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2710.4s)]
*  government. We heard throughout the week, I've reposted it on X, $65 billion is paid out to [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2714.1600000000003s)]
*  consulting organizations beyond just that one in these time and materials cost plus contracts. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2722.0800000000004s)]
*  If you start to add all of these up, today we just heard that the $2 billion [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2727.76s)]
*  grift to Stacey Abrams was canceled and they're now starting a DOJ [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2733.76s)]
*  investigation into how those dollars got given to her. All of these things start to add up. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2738.1600000000003s)]
*  It may be the case that if there's an upper bound on tariffs, that there will be more than a trillion. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2743.84s)]
*  And Elon kind of fills in the gap, but I think it's possible. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2751.44s)]
*  They are looking, Gavin, also at military spending and maybe cutting that 8% a year [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2755.68s)]
*  every year for a couple of years. That's where big dollars are sitting. And obviously nobody [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2761.52s)]
*  wants to touch social security, despite, I do have to point this out for my besties. You guys [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2765.2799999999997s)]
*  did a great job with that interview. And, you know, I just want to say FTMZ for like trying to spin it [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2769.52s)]
*  as, you know, Lutnick was trying to take away people's social security. They've literally took [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2775.9199999999996s)]
*  an hour plus interview. They clipped it to try to make it seem like he was saying the opposite of [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2783.12s)]
*  what he said. He was saying the fraudsters will be the first to respond. Not my mom. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2790.4s)]
*  My mom would just, you know, call eventually and say, Hey, can I, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2797.52s)]
*  she would assume that there was good intentions. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2800.0s)]
*  Yes. Whereas the fraudsters would be like, Oh man, I got to get here. I think it's great. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2802.64s)]
*  You know what? You can switch or did the same thing. No, let me finish my little thing here. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2806.0s)]
*  Tramont, because I don't want you guys to have to defend yourself. Listen, I couldn't make it. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2809.92s)]
*  You guys did these last minute interviews, Mazel Tov. We missed you. I thank you for saying that. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2813.76s)]
*  I would have loved to be there. I will be at the next ones for people who are saying like, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2818.4s)]
*  Oh, there's some conspiracy. There's no conspiracy. I had ski week. These guys went to do business or [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2821.6800000000003s)]
*  whatever they were doing and to see their friends in DC. And, you know, these things happened very [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2825.44s)]
*  rapidly. And I wasn't able to get them. Bottom line, these were great, substantive, long interviews [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2830.4s)]
*  from Democrats. One of them, a gay Democrat, by the way, the highest ranking gay Democrat, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2837.76s)]
*  who's ever been in an administration, the left and the media should be giving praise to these [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2842.0800000000004s)]
*  interviews. They should be studying them and they're doing the exact opposite. They're trying to spin [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2847.6000000000004s)]
*  them into something they weren't. It's a gift. What the all in podcast did to the American people [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2852.32s)]
*  by showing them a long form interview with the administration, explaining these details. Don't [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2857.28s)]
*  spin it. I think it's great. I think it's great. I'm sorry. I'm pissed off about it. No, I, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2862.88s)]
*  I don't think you should be pissed off. I think it's wonderful that these people lie. I think [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2867.76s)]
*  it's incredible that they just put it out there and it just further erodes what's happening. I [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2871.6000000000004s)]
*  think if once Bobby puts a nail in the coffin of pharma ads on TV, bye bye Anderson Cooper, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2877.36s)]
*  bye bye all these guys. I think it's great. I'm so pissed off. I'm sorry. Like when I see people [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2884.0s)]
*  lie like that, they should be lying. They should be lying. They should. It's great. They're, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2889.5200000000004s)]
*  because they will not exist. Okay, Gavin, you're a neutral third party. Go ahead. No, I'll just say [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2893.6800000000003s)]
*  three really quick points. Like first, what Howard Lutnick literally said was if we can find a lot [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2897.2s)]
*  of waste, fraud and abuse, we don't have to raise the retirement age. Everybody's talking about [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2902.72s)]
*  raising the retirement age to 70. If we administer these programs more efficiently, we can keep it [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2907.3599999999997s)]
*  at 65. And you know, that's good for everyone. The second thing is just interesting to me. There's [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2912.3999999999996s)]
*  so much doubt about this when the inspector generals of, you know, both Biden and Obama, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2917.6s)]
*  you know, said there were hundreds of billions of dollars in waste, fraud and abuse. And I would [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2924.16s)]
*  just say someone in my immediate family has had their social security, their identity stolen, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2927.04s)]
*  and someone is using their social security number to collect unemployment benefits in Alabama. And [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2933.6s)]
*  this has been going on for two years and they've been unable to stop it. And so, you know, you don't [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2940.3999999999996s)]
*  want to rely too much on anecdote, but I think this is really happening. And then just the third [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2945.3599999999997s)]
*  thing I would just say is I do think, you know, no one has ever raised, no president has ever raised [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2950.88s)]
*  my taxes more than Trump did. And I think they are pretty convicted in their focus on normal [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2956.0s)]
*  working class Americans and making their lives better is actually genuinely their North Star. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2962.56s)]
*  You can disagree with the theory of the case. You can disagree with, you know, the way they're [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2969.6s)]
*  communicating it, but I think their intentions are good. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2975.28s)]
*  Absolutely. And you know what he even said in the interview, if you, if you really listen to it, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2979.84s)]
*  he said he was disgusted by the idea that you would even raise the social security age. I think [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2984.7200000000003s)]
*  we should, by the way, any rational person, I think the majority of people say, Hey, maybe it [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2990.32s)]
*  should go up a year or two. Maybe we should have a little austerity here on the margins. But no, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2994.48s)]
*  of course not. We can't talk about that. And, you know, the thing this administration could do better [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=2999.0400000000004s)]
*  is communication. Those two long-form interviews was a great step in the right direction. They [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3005.04s)]
*  should do more of those and do should do a better job of explaining this waste and fraud. They're [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3009.12s)]
*  doing a good job. I give them like, you know, a B plus, but there's more work to be done here. And [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3014.4s)]
*  there's waste, there's overspending, there's fraud, and there's abuse, right? These are like [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3019.92s)]
*  different categories to get to the fraud that takes building legal cases. All that stuff's [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3025.2s)]
*  going to have to be referred to people. We have a justice system here. It's going to take [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3031.2s)]
*  years to figure out if somebody actually stole, but waste and overspending. We're going to find [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3035.12s)]
*  that pretty quickly. So it's a process people. And I, for one, trust the process because [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3040.7200000000003s)]
*  we're overspending massively. Let's get to some other conversations here. I think maybe we start [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3046.08s)]
*  with Jay, I just think it is, it is whether it's a semi-annual or quarterly, something that is like [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3050.64s)]
*  the Doge report and everything audited and triple checked. These are the three categories. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3058.08s)]
*  This is what we found. I think something like that would be very helpful. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3064.72s)]
*  I think they need investigative journalists. I'm happy to help with this. I'll do a Doge pod. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3068.56s)]
*  You know, listen, I'm not part of the administration. Everybody knows I was [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3072.72s)]
*  a never Trump or I'm independent, blah, blah, blah. Slammer to slam, slam. I would totally [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3074.9599999999996s)]
*  go in there. And I would do a Doge part. Why do you keep saying independent and then you throw [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3078.56s)]
*  yourself a label that says you're not independent? You're dependent. Telling people I was a never [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3084.48s)]
*  Trump or but if Trump is going to surround himself with a moderate Democrats, truly independent. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3089.4399999999996s)]
*  I like to think so. I try to be independent called balls and strikes here on the program. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3095.2s)]
*  I'm not going to bend the knee to the administration. I'm going to, I'm going to be critical of Trump [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3098.9599999999996s)]
*  coin. I'm going to be critical of these deportations, which we're going to get to. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3103.2s)]
*  And I will say critical things, but I would go in there and I would do the Doge pod with Elon or [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3106.56s)]
*  whoever in the group is and go point by point through these things to explain it to the American [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3110.72s)]
*  public. Let's keep moving here. We got such a full docket. I want to talk about signal. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3115.2799999999997s)]
*  Bro, text our bestie and talk to him about it. I think that's a good idea. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3119.04s)]
*  Maybe I should go in there because listen, I don't even consider this like a Trump administration. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3122.16s)]
*  Now I consider it as a democratic, moderate administration. Everybody around Trump. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3125.84s)]
*  I think I might be in, I might be in, you guys look like you had a good time. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3132.0s)]
*  Did you vote for Trump? I don't want to bring in my vote. I did not vote for Kamala. Let's keep [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3140.0s)]
*  moving here. I'm going to keep dropping. Wow. My god for Kamala. I couldn't vote for her. She said, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3145.84s)]
*  I don't want to say it, but [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3151.44s)]
*  anyway, let's keep going. I don't want to vote for somebody who was selected. I wanted to vote [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3155.44s)]
*  for somebody who had a primary and the Democrats disgrunt the odd for not having a speed run primary [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3158.88s)]
*  signal gate. That's the biggest story in America right now on Monday. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3164.2400000000002s)]
*  J. Cal is turning. This is incredible. What a day. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3167.76s)]
*  No, I mean, listen, I'm going to call balls and strikes right now. 70% of what they're doing. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3169.76s)]
*  I agree with 30%. I don't. I'm going to get to the 30% on a human rights basis. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3173.6s)]
*  I think you just admitted you voted for Trump. It's really incredible. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3177.36s)]
*  Anyway, let's keep moving here. I'm from the great state of Texas. I'll leave it at that. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3180.24s)]
*  Signal gate, signal gate, signal gate. On Monday, the Atlantic published a story [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3184.7999999999997s)]
*  titled the Trump administration accidentally texted me their war plans. Somehow. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3189.2s)]
*  Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was added to a super high profile signal group with [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3193.68s)]
*  our secretary of state, our vice president, Tulsi Besant, the CIA director, the secretary of defense. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3201.52s)]
*  How is this possible? Folks, they added a journalist, the editor-in-chief of the [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3209.44s)]
*  Atlantic to their war planning signal group. They shouldn't be using signal obviously to do this stuff. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3213.92s)]
*  And inside this group, they discussed the plans to strike Houthi targets across Yemen. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3220.16s)]
*  Nobody noticed, nobody checked that the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic was in the [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3225.44s)]
*  group chat. They included the exact targets, the actions, the timing of all of this. It was [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3231.68s)]
*  apparently cut and pasted from some other system by Hegsep, our secretary of defense and former [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3240.0s)]
*  Fox commentator. That's not a dig. It's just a fact. I'm not saying it isn't. Chamath, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3246.64s)]
*  people are losing their mind over this. I could get into all the details. I think most people [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3253.04s)]
*  know it because it's taking up the whole, all the oxygen in the room, in the media, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3256.56s)]
*  in the group chats. Number one, what's your general take on what happened here? How stupid is this? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3261.44s)]
*  How ridiculous is it? Does it matter? Go ahead, Chamath. Start us off here. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3267.44s)]
*  I think that what folks have stopped talking about entirely, which I think is just worth touching [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3272.24s)]
*  upon, is what is actually going on that necessitated this group chat to be created in the first place [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3277.84s)]
*  in such haste. I have a couple of images that I pulled just to explain what this issue is. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3286.7999999999997s)]
*  The problem that we have is that somewhere after the war with Gaza, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3293.44s)]
*  Iran continues to find these Houthi rebels in Yemen. What do they start to do? They start to [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3301.7599999999998s)]
*  invade and flood into the Red Sea. They start to block up the Suez Canal at different points, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3308.08s)]
*  making it very perilous for freight traffic to get there. What do folks do? They're either forced [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3314.48s)]
*  to go all the way around the Cape of Good Hope or risk attack through the Suez Canal. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3320.56s)]
*  What do you think happens? Well, the traffic through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3326.2400000000002s)]
*  falls off a cliff. Then you would ask, well, why is that important? Well, the problem is that [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3331.2s)]
*  because of that other chart and this chart, prices start to skyrocket. If you're trying to ship [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3336.32s)]
*  things, even going into the United States, prices start to rise 30%, 40%. Going to Europe, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3341.92s)]
*  prices are rising 300% and 400%. If you add that all together, as Gavin said earlier, we're in this [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3347.6000000000004s)]
*  very delicate moment where we're fixing all these parts of the economy. The thing we can't have [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3354.48s)]
*  is productivity go down. You can't have a recession. If you have a bunch of input prices that go up [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3359.6000000000004s)]
*  or trade slow down, now you're bringing the likelihood of a recession to the forefront. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3366.08s)]
*  That's one thing. The second thing, which was included in the group chat, is it turns out that [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3373.2799999999997s)]
*  nobody was in a position to fight off these Houthis except the United States. The British, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3378.88s)]
*  the French, all of their naval capacity wasn't strong enough or adaptable enough to fight these [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3385.36s)]
*  folks off. The United States had no choice but to attack these guys and reset. What happened? [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3391.04s)]
*  Now all of a sudden, traffic is reset, volumes are back up. By the third week of March, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3398.64s)]
*  which is where we are now, we're back to where they were even a year ago. The price of shipping [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3404.96s)]
*  is now contained. The inflation risk is contained. The productivity hit is contained. It's just [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3410.96s)]
*  important to understand. That's the context of why they did the attack. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3417.76s)]
*  I find it crazy that we still actually, for 95 articles though, Jason, on Signal, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3422.7200000000003s)]
*  we have only less than one article on this. I just wanted the smart people to listen to our [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3428.6400000000003s)]
*  pod to actually understand it. The second thing I'll say is- [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3432.8s)]
*  And we're going to send the bill to Europe because this is really a European problem because [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3435.6000000000004s)]
*  we have the whole Pacific Ocean. We can accept things through and you can go to ports in Texas. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3440.6400000000003s)]
*  So the point is we're on a shot clock. People had to act quickly. Here's my big problem with [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3445.4399999999996s)]
*  Signal. I think it was a f*** up. I think it was an important set of decisions that had to be made, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3452.7999999999997s)]
*  but I think using Signal was a mistake, but there's very one narrow reason why. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3460.3999999999996s)]
*  We've said this in our group chat. The Signal desktop app is total and complete garbage. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3465.3599999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3471.28s)]
*  And when you build apps, somewhere along the way, we were all told, all of us as app developers, [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3472.2400000000002s)]
*  oh, you need to have an app on every endpoint. It needs to be available for Android. It needs [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3478.0s)]
*  to be available for the iPad. It needs to be available for your phone. It needs to be available [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3483.6000000000004s)]
*  for the desktop. And the problem is now you'll have a computer at home. You'll have a computer [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3487.52s)]
*  in your den. You'll have a computer at the office. Some IT person comes and helps you [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3493.1200000000003s)]
*  install this stuff. And now all of a sudden, instead of having one attack vector, you have [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3497.76s)]
*  seven. So this is insanity. So it's a mistake. It's a stupid mistake. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3502.8s)]
*  But I think it's a mistake. And so I think like, you know, let's give it two Scaramoochies. I think [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3508.88s)]
*  we'll forget about it. Give it a Scaramoochie or two. Should somebody resign? Should somebody be [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3513.5200000000004s)]
*  fired? No, no, no. I think these are mistakes. And I think, by the way, sorry, the other thing is [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3518.2400000000002s)]
*  John Ratcliffe is very clear. There are very clear procedures that they inherited, which is [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3522.4s)]
*  no administration's fault. But there's some security IT person that writes these things. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3526.56s)]
*  It's approved. And so rewrite those things to be more normal. Friedberg, your thoughts here? Do you [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3532.08s)]
*  have a take? So I think this issue will become one of whether or not government officials can [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3537.44s)]
*  use signal and apps like it for communication. This is a controversy that's been around for [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3548.88s)]
*  some time, but it's actually being pried in the courts right now. There's, I think, four active [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3556.4s)]
*  cases. So the Federal Records Act was originally passed in 1950. And then there was this amendment [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3560.96s)]
*  related to electronic communications that was passed in 2014. And the Federal Records Act says [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3568.32s)]
*  all government officials and employees have to create, maintain, and preserve adequate and [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3574.08s)]
*  proper documentation of activities, transactions, decisions, policies, and other business. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3578.8s)]
*  That's the law. That's the law. And it says adequate and proper documentation is defined [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3584.0s)]
*  as records that clearly document the government's decisions and actions. And that can be preserved [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3588.08s)]
*  and retrieved for accountability, transparency, and historical purposes. And then we have the [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3594.08s)]
*  FOIA laws, which allow you to, as a citizen or as a journalist, you'll make a request. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3597.6s)]
*  Freedom of Information Act. This is to have a functioning democracy. What you're talking [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3601.68s)]
*  about here, Friedberg is people who work for us should not be able to end run their communication. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3606.32s)]
*  And that's the law. Yeah, the FOIA provides access to government records because our taxpayer [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3611.68s)]
*  dollars pay for the government to do its work and therefore access. So the question is, is the [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3616.0s)]
*  particulars of the communication that's taking place amongst these individuals in this case and [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3621.52s)]
*  in the daily work done by government officials that's like this, where people are updating one [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3627.2s)]
*  another or talking with one another about things. Does that have restrictions around preservation [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3633.12s)]
*  of records under the Federal Records Act and the amendment that came out in 2014? [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3638.96s)]
*  And so there were a bunch of lawsuits. One is the Competitive Enterprise Institute against the OSTP, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3643.28s)]
*  the Office of Science and Technology Policy in 2016, where using email accounts and communications [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3647.84s)]
*  that weren't properly archived or preserved was challenged by this institute. And the DC Circuit [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3653.84s)]
*  Court of Appeals ruled that the officials who use private email for official business must copy or [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3658.64s)]
*  forward email communications to government accounts to comply. The Citizens for Responsibility and [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3663.84s)]
*  Ethics in Washington Act sued the Trump administration in 2017. And this is ongoing [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3667.92s)]
*  in multiple forms right now in the courts, where there's a lot of procedural complexity. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3673.12s)]
*  But the courts have generally said that they emphasize that these officials are obligated [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3679.44s)]
*  to preserve official communications and that failure is violating the laws. Then there's [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3683.6800000000003s)]
*  Judicial Watch versus Department of Homeland Security. And then there's National Security [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3689.12s)]
*  Archive versus Mike Pompeo, the State Department 2019, which is also still in the courts. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3693.28s)]
*  And I think from these cases and this particular incident, there's going to become much greater [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3698.32s)]
*  kind of call it clarity, and also a better understanding of the consequences of what [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3704.4s)]
*  communication do you need to preserve records of? And what communication are you allowed to have [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3709.76s)]
*  off the record that you can have? I mean, we get it. There's a what do you personally think? Like, [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3715.28s)]
*  what do you use David Friedberg, the Sultan of science thing? [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3720.56s)]
*  I think it is counterproductive to have every piece of communication foible and kept in the [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3723.6s)]
*  public record. I think that's a mistake. And I'll tell you why. When you're making a business [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3728.7999999999997s)]
*  decision, let's say you're making an HR decision, the management team sitting around, they're [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3733.04s)]
*  talking about a particular candidate or person at the company. Should we give this person a raise? [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3736.24s)]
*  Should we terminate someone? You don't want to have a record of that, that employees can then [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3740.24s)]
*  go pull up and see and understand because it will have a really muting effect and a dampening effect [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3744.32s)]
*  on the types of conversation on the authenticity of the conversation on the productivity of the [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3750.4s)]
*  conversation that you will be able to have. If you're forced to say this is always going to be in [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3755.04s)]
*  the public domain. Sure. And so I do think that this idea on like, how did you make a decision? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3760.0s)]
*  And what was the action that you took? Those to me feel like they should be recorded. And they [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3765.44s)]
*  should be foible. But all of the background material, all of the noise, all of the dialogue [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3771.2000000000003s)]
*  that leads up to that. I do not think that should be foible. And I think that you need to justify [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3776.48s)]
*  the actions and the decisions that you're making as a government official. But I don't think that [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3782.48s)]
*  you need to have a record personally of everything that led up to that action or that decision, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3786.2400000000002s)]
*  because I think that that will be really deeply unproductive. Let me give a take here. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3790.96s)]
*  This is a serious issue. They shouldn't be doing it for obvious reasons. It's very easy to hack [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3795.92s)]
*  personal phones. And they do have a way to do this, which is called the skiff. And there's other [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3800.96s)]
*  places for them to have secure communication. And as you point out, they work for the American [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3806.48s)]
*  people, they should be a record of this, they're breaking the law by doing this. So the the the [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3810.64s)]
*  administration should not be breaking the law. Obviously, we don't want them to do that. Also, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3815.68s)]
*  Hexa clearly took a report of the attack plan, cut and pasted it from some server somewhere and [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3820.8s)]
*  then pasted it over. This is a known vector, your clipboard is what it's called. And this is an [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3828.56s)]
*  attack vector that you know, anybody who's in it, or has basic security training knows that you can [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3833.2799999999997s)]
*  get your clipboard hacked very easily. They need to take ownership of it. And this is one of the [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3840.16s)]
*  things that this administration in this group does very poorly. Instead of taking ownership, [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3845.2799999999997s)]
*  like Chumot said here, just take just own it, no big deal. This is a, you know, a chance for us to [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3850.24s)]
*  learn and iterate on the security protocols, yada yada, we apologize, let's move on. They attack. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3855.12s)]
*  And this is Trump's like playbook, we have to attack the journalists. So what did they do? [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3861.44s)]
*  They attack the journalists, they take no ownership. And the second thing, which this [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3864.7999999999997s)]
*  administration really has an Achilles heel floor is on top of just me taking not taking ownership [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3868.48s)]
*  and attacking the hypocrisy, because this was the entirety of the anti Hillary movement was, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3874.0s)]
*  oh, my God, she did this exact same thing with her email. And Republicans had a long list of, [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3880.56s)]
*  oh, my God, here's how to finish, you'll get your chance to mouth to defend your boys. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3886.08s)]
*  The point is, it's complete utter hypocrisy. And it's distasteful to attack the journalists, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3891.6s)]
*  which you added, this is incompetence. It's a mistake, own it, hold on, and then every single [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3896.64s)]
*  person's phone has to get dumped now. And so they're not doing a good job communicating what [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3902.48s)]
*  they're going to do to make sure that somebody hasn't gotten onto everybody's personal phone. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3907.04s)]
*  Why are they doing this on their personal phones? As you very much pointed out, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3912.56s)]
*  these are attack vectors, they should be using the phones issued to them for these communications, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3917.04s)]
*  not personal devices. The first thing is, I think you're wrong about the fact that they don't have [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3922.56s)]
*  an adequate claim with this journalist. I think it's fair to ask, what is the ethical standard [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3930.64s)]
*  that that journalist should have had? If you're added to something, you know it's inappropriate. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3936.72s)]
*  The guy just sat there lurking. You don't know how it was added, Jason, you're speculating. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3943.2799999999997s)]
*  It could have been, hold on, it could have been injected. Okay, it could have been injected into [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3948.3199999999997s)]
*  a laptop. Nobody knows yet. This is why I think, just admit what happened was a mistake. I think [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3952.8799999999997s)]
*  they did that. They're looking into it. Let them look into it. I don't think you need to have [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3959.4399999999996s)]
*  scalpels and heads and all this other stuff. But I do think it's important to say, why was this guy [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3964.08s)]
*  lurking about? Okay, what ethical standard should he have had? Clearly he had none. And by the way, [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3969.2799999999997s)]
*  this guy- Oh no, that's ridiculous. You're so wrong on this, Shemap. He tried to figure out- [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3974.24s)]
*  Okay, your opinion is wrong in this case, perspective. He tried to figure out what was [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3978.56s)]
*  going on here. And then when he did figure out it, he contacted them and removed himself. He didn't [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3983.2s)]
*  stay on there indefinitely. If he did that, that would be wrong. But for him to be added to something, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3988.64s)]
*  he may have been being attacked himself. And the other reason you're wrong is they went on the [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3994.16s)]
*  attack immediately and they denied that there was anything wrong. They did not take ownership of it. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=3999.92s)]
*  And that's why we're having this debate right now is they don't take ownership of these things. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4005.2s)]
*  Marco Rubio did say, someone made a big mistake. There were no consequences. We learned we're going [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4009.04s)]
*  to do better. And he is the secretary of state. So someone in the administration did say that this [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4016.3199999999997s)]
*  was a mistake. Yeah. And the other guys attacked the journalists. So that's what I find distaste. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4021.92s)]
*  No, no, no, but hold on a second. Trump said it was a mistake too. I don't think these guys- It is. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4025.2000000000003s)]
*  It's a mistake. So fix it and move on. But the point should be, what is the mistake? The mistake is [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4028.96s)]
*  the security protocols that these guys rely on. I'm going to just go out on a limb. As expert as [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4036.56s)]
*  they are in policy, I think they're inexperts in technology. So there is probably somebody that is [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4043.2000000000003s)]
*  responsible for how all of these folks communicate, how all of these folks get software installed on [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4049.84s)]
*  their multiple devices, how they get new devices. I'm guessing that it's not them. So I think that- [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4056.32s)]
*  They're using their personal devices. I think that's the problem. Why is anybody in government [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4064.1600000000003s)]
*  using a personal device to share plans- How do you know that? [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4068.88s)]
*  For tech? Because they said it was their personal devices. They've said it. This has been established [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4073.1200000000003s)]
*  that they did this on their personal devices. That's totally established now. And they have [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4077.52s)]
*  skiffs for this. So I just don't understand why they don't just use their- But again, I'm saying [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4083.36s)]
*  the bigger issue is that they had to operationalize quickly. They weren't in a position to be together. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4088.48s)]
*  The importance of the issue is getting lost. It was an important issue that has global consequences. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4094.72s)]
*  Shamak, they're all within 10 feet of a skiff at all times. Their SUVs are skiffs. Their offices [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4099.28s)]
*  are skiffs. Gavin, do you have any final thoughts before we move on to the- [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4104.16s)]
*  Yeah, I would just say I thought the contents were interesting and that there are a couple of things. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4107.04s)]
*  There's all this, oh, the Trump administration is cozying up to Russia, trying to blow up this [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4111.599999999999s)]
*  post-World War II alliance with Europe. There are two things. One, they said, we are the only people [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4119.5199999999995s)]
*  on our side of the ledger who can deal with the Houthis. And our side of the ledger, meaning [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4125.36s)]
*  recognizing Europe, our traditional alliances. The good team. The good team. So I thought that [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4132.4s)]
*  was interesting that just for all the rhetoric, they're conscious of who's the home team. And [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4138.5599999999995s)]
*  second, it was very clear to everyone in that chat and JD Vance raised it, 3% of America's trade goes [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4144.0s)]
*  through the Suez Canal, 40% of Europe's trade. So we are really doing this. It will help us a little [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4150.48s)]
*  bit, but it will help Europe a vast amount. And we're doing something that helps them [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4157.84s)]
*  that they cannot do. Now, hey, they're asking that they want to be paid. But I just think it made me [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4163.2s)]
*  think that behind the scenes, a lot of this rhetoric about the US and the European schism [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4168.96s)]
*  is overblown and we're still helping them. I thought that was interesting. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4175.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's an important note. Okay, let's move on to our final two stories. The [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4179.4400000000005s)]
*  Trump administration has deported 238 alleged gang members to a pretty severe prison called [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4184.24s)]
*  CICOT, C-E-C-O-T, prison in El Salvador. Here's a clip of them being dragged out of the United States [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4190.88s)]
*  and put into this extremely notorious prison. This was all done under the Alien Enemies Act [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4197.36s)]
*  of 1798. This allows the president to detain and deport individuals without due process from, [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4206.48s)]
*  an enemy nation during an invasion or, predatory incursion. It's been used before, but only during [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4212.719999999999s)]
*  actual wars. FDR used it to deport thousands of Germans, Italians, Japanese during World War II. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4218.799999999999s)]
*  The Trump administration is claiming that the gang members were sent to the US, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4225.12s)]
*  intentionally calling them a hybrid criminal state. Not surprisingly, most of them were not. All of [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4228.96s)]
*  them had criminal records in the US. This was confirmed by ICE. And obviously, some number of [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4234.16s)]
*  them appear to have been misidentified as gang members or terrorists, I can tell you, [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4239.92s)]
*  you know, coming from a law enforcement family. And just looking at the statistics, out of 238, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4246.4800000000005s)]
*  you're not going to bat a thousand, so maybe you get a couple of these wrong. Former pro soccer [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4251.52s)]
*  player, Jersey Reyes Barrios, he fled Venezuela after being tortured by the government for [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4255.84s)]
*  protesting. He's a refugee. He has been mistaken for a gang member, according to his people. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4261.68s)]
*  Because he's got an arm tattoo supporting his favorite club, Real Madrid. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4269.599999999999s)]
*  And there is a social media post that ICE officials believe featured him making gang signs, [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4274.24s)]
*  but it was actually the language for I love you, according to his attorney. Second example, [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4281.68s)]
*  a shoe salesman and social media influencer, Noberto Rodriguez. He fled Venezuela for Colombia out of [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4287.68s)]
*  desperation because he and his family were starving. He's a father of three. He was also suspected [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4293.599999999999s)]
*  because of a tattoo which features playing cards and dice. His family says he got to he got it to [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4298.48s)]
*  cover a scar on his forearm. And third and final example, stylist and makeup artist, Andre Hernandez. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4303.36s)]
*  He is being represented by the Immigration Defenders Law Center. He claims he has no [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4311.44s)]
*  criminal history. He sought asylum after fleeing Venezuela, where he was persecuted for being gay. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4317.5199999999995s)]
*  Again, his arrest was based on tattoos that his attorneys claim are not gang affiliated. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4322.8s)]
*  This has caused the US District Judge to pause these deportations. The administration has [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4331.4400000000005s)]
*  apparently continued these deportations and they're even gloating by doing videos, [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4337.12s)]
*  highly produced videos, threatening people with the prison in El Salvador. Again, the Seacont. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4342.88s)]
*  Your thoughts, Chamath, on this extradition process, if any? [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4350.96s)]
*  Chmath I mean, as long as there's a mechanism for these mistakes to get rectified. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4356.4s)]
*  Seems like the overwhelming majority of these folks should not [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4364.799999999999s)]
*  have been in the United States and were part of illegal criminal organizations. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4369.12s)]
*  Chmath Okay, so there should be a mechanism. Gavin, your thoughts? [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4373.12s)]
*  Gavin If innocent people were sent to a prison, that's a terrible mistake. And that happens. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4376.4s)]
*  And it shouldn't happen and hopefully it gets rectified. But I guess my bigger thought is a [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4384.639999999999s)]
*  little bit, you know, this administration, as we discussed, they have a really ambitious agenda. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4389.5199999999995s)]
*  They want to fundamentally change America in ways that they think will be better for kind of [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4394.88s)]
*  blue collar, normal working Americans. And things like this, you know, signal gate, [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4398.8s)]
*  if you if they made a mistake and sent innocent people to this prison, [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4405.28s)]
*  there's only so many of those mistakes they can afford before they lose kind of the mandate [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4409.68s)]
*  necessary to accomplish their goals. And, you know, hopefully it's, you know, we're in whatever, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4415.76s)]
*  we're not even into the, you know, third full month. 66 days, 66 days, we're into the third [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4423.28s)]
*  month. But we're 4.5% of the way through the second term. And it feels like [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4429.2s)]
*  six caramuchis in. Yes, it's brutal. It ain't easy. This is such a good point, though, [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4436.5599999999995s)]
*  Gavin. Continue. They just execution matters. Like if they they to accomplish their goals, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4441.84s)]
*  they need to execute at a high level and communicate clearly and effectively. And just [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4448.72s)]
*  if innocent people were sent to, you know, this prison mistake, signal gate, look, you know, hey, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4457.12s)]
*  maybe it's a big mistake. It's a small mistake, depending on where you said I thought Marco [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4464.16s)]
*  Rubio's response was good. But just like I think execution is important for them to accomplish [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4467.360000000001s)]
*  their goals. Great. Freeburg, any thoughts here? I do not agree with sending people [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4472.48s)]
*  to prison or detention center without due process. I felt similarly that Guantanamo Bay, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4479.44s)]
*  because I don't think it matches the rights and values that the United States should stand for. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4485.5199999999995s)]
*  I think it's different if you believe that they're here illegally, they're part of a criminal [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4492.4s)]
*  enterprise, and we don't want to try them in courts here, then we should ship them back to a port of [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4495.599999999999s)]
*  departure somewhere else in another country. Maybe it's back to Venezuela and let their courts try [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4499.52s)]
*  them. But I will talk a little bit about this El Salvador motivation. As you guys know, the El [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4504.64s)]
*  Salvador prison that they set up for putting the gang members in had a radical impact on living [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4510.400000000001s)]
*  standards in the country. In 2015, the homicide rate per capita in El Salvador was 103 people per [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4515.92s)]
*  hundred thousand. So one out of every thousand people were murdered every year. They introduced [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4523.52s)]
*  this aggressive policy of rounding people up without due process and putting them in this prison. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4528.48s)]
*  Through that action, they were able to reduce the homicide rate per capita below two per hundred [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4534.0s)]
*  thousand, which is what it was last year, 1.9. So it had a radically positive effect on society, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4539.2s)]
*  but obviously at the cost of a value that we in the United States hold dear, which is the value of [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4545.36s)]
*  due process and the importance of due process, because all it takes is one innocent life being [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4551.599999999999s)]
*  locked up. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4556.08s)]
*  I'm sorry, you're saying El Salvador, there was no due process? [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4556.64s)]
*  There was no due process. And so there are plenty of stories. If you watch the documentaries on this [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4559.44s)]
*  prison, there are plenty of stories of people that later were released when they were found to be [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4563.44s)]
*  completely innocent and randomly rounded up or caught up in a sweep or something that they [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4567.76s)]
*  shouldn't have been at. And there was actually one fascinating interview I saw of one of the guys who [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4571.44s)]
*  spent over a year in the prison was completely innocent, but he said, you know what, it was [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4576.88s)]
*  worth it because the government's been able to clean up the streets. I got to find this clip, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4581.36s)]
*  but I was really shocked. I couldn't believe that a guy that spent a year in this prison [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4585.52s)]
*  actually had something positive to say, because it was such a profoundly- [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4589.040000000001s)]
*  Well, maybe he had to say that to get out. Who knows? [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4591.200000000001s)]
*  It was such a profoundly difficult place to live in El Salvador. And we've all heard these stories, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4593.6s)]
*  but I do think that there is a cue being taken by this administration, that there is a way to very [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4598.4800000000005s)]
*  quickly resolve to a positive outcome with respect to immigration and crime. But I do think Gavin's [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4605.92s)]
*  point is right, that we do have to have some boundary conditions, particularly as it relates [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4611.04s)]
*  to human rights that we do value here in this country. And as long as there's a court trial, [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4615.68s)]
*  as long as there's a judge, as long as there's some sort of, it doesn't need to be a jury of peers, [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4620.64s)]
*  but as long as there's some evidentiary hearing to make the determination that someone is likely [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4624.56s)]
*  this criminal, it makes sense. But again, I'm much more in favor if there's going to be forced [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4630.8s)]
*  movement of people, I don't think that they should necessarily be moved into a prison as much as [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4636.4s)]
*  move to a port of departure and have them tried in another country if there's a crime, or we try [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4640.48s)]
*  them here and put them in prison. I agree so much with what you just said. Due process is important. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4646.0s)]
*  Like America, like human rights are a core American value. That was great. You acknowledged [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4651.679999999999s)]
*  that like the outcome in El Salvador was good. Homicides down 99.9% lots of lives saved. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4657.759999999999s)]
*  And just, you know, there needs to be a balance between these. Yes. Then let me ask you guys a [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4665.04s)]
*  question, very pointed question. If you guys could implement an El Salvadorian style incarceration [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4670.08s)]
*  system tomorrow, and it would have the exact same effect on American crime. So, yeah, cuts it by [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4676.4s)]
*  nine. Absolutely. And I'll give you, there's a four or 5% error rate. Would you do it? Would the [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4683.76s)]
*  benefit of the safer society be outweighed in your minds by the error rate or not? [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4690.48s)]
*  Absolutely not. Most people would say yes, because they would view it wouldn't affect them. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4699.52s)]
*  And then the two to 5% of people who have family members who are innocent get locked up. I get [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4704.160000000001s)]
*  that. I'm saying what do you think? Yeah, I wouldn't compromise that value. Yeah, we don't want to [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4708.88s)]
*  compromise that value. It's incredibly dangerous. Yeah, incredibly dangerous. We've been riding on [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4713.76s)]
*  a bit of a high. And I think there's a couple of things here this administration could do better. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4718.080000000001s)]
*  And communicating when they make a mistake, and then human rights is such a core part, [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4724.080000000001s)]
*  I believe me Jason Calaghanis believes that there is a sadistic nature to this administration, [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4728.96s)]
*  it is an Achilles heel for them. And when you see them doing videos from these prisons and saying, [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4734.64s)]
*  this is going to happen to you. And this prison is known for torture. And this prison is known for [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4740.88s)]
*  just absolutely the most abhorrent issues in the world. This is the sadistic nature of this [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4746.0s)]
*  administration that I think they need to drop because it is going to derail them. And people [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4752.32s)]
*  care in this country deeply about human rights and process. And there is a constitutional [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4756.4s)]
*  issue right now because Trump and this administration is disobeying the court when [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4761.679999999999s)]
*  they say, Hey, let's slow down here. There is no cost, zero cost to Americans sending these people [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4766.639999999999s)]
*  to a way station and investigating each of these cases to make sure we don't send a gay hairdresser [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4773.04s)]
*  to El Salvador, another country to be tortured in prison, if that is in fact the case. And it is [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4778.48s)]
*  against all American principles to not have due process and to have innocent people potentially [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4784.72s)]
*  go to jail. And what all Republicans should do is here and say, this is going to derail the [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4791.12s)]
*  administration. These are the things that will build up over time. And people, just pragmatically [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4796.320000000001s)]
*  speaking, people in America who are rooting for this administration to do some good things, [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4802.320000000001s)]
*  like I am, when they do stuff like this, and I represent a large swath of people, [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4807.4400000000005s)]
*  it loses them votes. And this is why they, I predict this is why they will lose the midterms. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4812.08s)]
*  If they continue to do this type of stuff, that's my position. It's not virtual signaling. I've [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4817.04s)]
*  cared about human rights long before the all in podcast existed. I, my first job was working at [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4821.36s)]
*  Amnesty International. And this is a giant mistake by this administration. Gavin, you had some [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4826.16s)]
*  thoughts. This whole debate is a question of ends versus means. And it's like, we all agree that the [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4831.52s)]
*  homicide rate down 99.9% in El Salvador is a good outcome. It's a good end. And this is one of the [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4837.44s)]
*  great philosophical questions. And it's, you know, we can debate it endlessly. And there has to be a [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4844.719999999999s)]
*  balance between the two. Human rights are a core American value. And I agree, I think, with a lot [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4852.48s)]
*  of what David said. But I also think if you are, you know, going back to that homicide rate, the [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4858.48s)]
*  Trump campaign, you know, they spoke to the mothers and the families of people who were brutally [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4864.16s)]
*  murdered or raped and murdered by people who were illegal immigrants and were convicted criminals in [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4870.96s)]
*  their home country and were known convicted criminals and somehow still were not apprehended [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4880.16s)]
*  and then committed terrible crimes that were very similar to the crimes they committed there. You [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4886.4s)]
*  have a lot of compassion for the victims too. But all they have to do, like one of, I thought, [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4890.8s)]
*  Elon's best moments, and I, you know, it's what Doge is doing is great. These are brilliant people [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4896.0s)]
*  working hard for free to do things that have never been done before in the government in terms of [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4901.04s)]
*  efficiency and kind of modernizing IT. But, you know, Elon said at one of the first press conferences, [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4907.360000000001s)]
*  listen, we're going to make mistakes, and then we're going to quickly correct them. So to me, [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4912.400000000001s)]
*  I think all the administration needs to say, and I do think more due process to David's point is [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4917.92s)]
*  good, is like, listen, if we made a mistake, it's terrible, and we're going to fix it immediately. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4922.8s)]
*  And it just, it brings, gives you so much credibility when you say that. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4929.599999999999s)]
*  Aaron Ross Agreed. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4933.84s)]
*  Sanyam Bhut But isn't due process happening? How else would you guys know that three out of the [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4934.88s)]
*  238 were miscast? The fact that you know that means the process is working. I think the [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4940.4s)]
*  question is, what about the other 235 people? [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4947.12s)]
*  David Erickson Their families talked to the press. This wasn't from the administration. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4949.599999999999s)]
*  Sanyam Bhut But the point is, it's there. So whether it's the Freedom Project, or whether [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4952.96s)]
*  it's the Southern Poverty Law Center, my point is there are resources. Is it bad when this happens? [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4956.4s)]
*  Absolutely. My question is, do you just blow the whole process up? And then what do you do with the [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4960.88s)]
*  other 235 people? [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4965.44s)]
*  David Erickson You'd hold all 238 at Gitmo if you wanted to in humane prisons, and process them, [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4966.5599999999995s)]
*  and then have their attorneys get to look at their case. You could give their cases to you could be [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4973.2s)]
*  public with their cases and say, here are the cases. These are the people were deporting and why. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4978.16s)]
*  Sanyam Bhut Right. So your specific issue is where they're being sent. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4982.24s)]
*  David Erickson Yes, that you try they're being sent to the most sadistic prison in the world. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4985.04s)]
*  Sanyam Bhut Do you want to answer your question about like, the 5% trade off? Like if you sweep [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4989.679999999999s)]
*  up 5% of the people being innocent, whether it's worth that trade off for crime? [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4994.48s)]
*  Sanyam Bhut Did I get an answer? [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=4999.12s)]
*  David Erickson Well, you asked the question, but I wanted to hear your answer. Like, what's your [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5002.96s)]
*  point of view on that? [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5006.24s)]
*  Sanyam Bhut I think that that's probably what happens today in America's prisons. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5006.96s)]
*  In fact, it's probably more than 5%. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5012.8s)]
*  David Erickson But I guess the question is, Jamath, what is an acceptable, you know, it's a little bit [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5014.24s)]
*  like the trolley problem. You know, there are many variations of this. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5017.84s)]
*  Sanyam Bhut I think the important thing is, I think that that's a bit above our pay grade, [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5020.48s)]
*  but I don't think it's above the president's. And I think that that was part of what he was elected [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5024.32s)]
*  to do is make that call. Because I don't think he hid behind any rhetoric. He was very clear about [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5029.76s)]
*  what his intentions were. And to your point, he did bring the, you know, Lake and Riley Act. I mean, [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5034.8s)]
*  they were very explicit about what their intentions were. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5040.8s)]
*  David Erickson Yes. Man, it just feels like a little more due process, being a little more [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5043.4400000000005s)]
*  careful with the signal. But also just going back to what were four and a half percent into [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5050.56s)]
*  the administration. I'm not saying, hey, mistakes were made, and it's okay, innocent people were [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5054.24s)]
*  sent to this prison. That's terrible. And I hope it gets rectified quickly. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5058.88s)]
*  Sanyam Bhut If there was some concession here, hey, if we made a mistake, we're going to fix it. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5061.92s)]
*  That would be a lot better than putting out promotional videos, lauding how brutal this [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5067.36s)]
*  prison is. That would go a long way with me. But we're seeing the opposite. They're releasing [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5072.64s)]
*  videos that they're producing. We will play one here for you to see. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5078.56s)]
*  David Erickson By the way, I think an important point about this, [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5083.04s)]
*  and perhaps, like the key part of the strategy of the administration is that this isn't the [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5089.12s)]
*  beginning of a continuous process. But they're sending a signal, which they expect will cause [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5094.0s)]
*  people to naturally emigrate out of the country that are committing crime or at risk of being [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5102.88s)]
*  caught for being associated with gangs and while being in the United States as a way to kind of [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5107.84s)]
*  chase folks out. So I think that there's some calculus and what's going on here with respect [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5113.84s)]
*  to the risk and the actions being, hey, look, if we do this to the first 240 people, and even if [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5118.0s)]
*  three or four innocent people get caught up, there's a net benefit ultimately because it [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5124.16s)]
*  will reduce the immigrants kind of coming to this country that are parts of gangs and perhaps some [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5129.4400000000005s)]
*  of them will choose to go home. David Erickson [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5135.44s)]
*  You know, they clearly believe that this is going to save innocent lives in America. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5137.44s)]
*  That is their clear belief system. Aaron Powell [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5144.48s)]
*  Well, yeah, and everybody wants that. Here's Secretary Kristi Noem from the prison itself. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5147.5199999999995s)]

*  to bring our terrorists here and to incarcerate them and have consequences for the violence that [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5162.08s)]
*  they have perpetuated in our communities. I also want everybody to know if you come to our country [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5167.36s)]
*  illegally, this is one of the consequences you could face. First of all, do not come to our [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5171.92s)]
*  country illegally. You will be removed and you will be prosecuted. But know that this facility [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5176.72s)]
*  is one of the tools in our toolkit that we will use if you commit crimes against the American people. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5182.4s)]
*  David Erickson Harsh words. She's trying to make it a deterrent clearly. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iazo7g40VbQ&t=5186.88s)]
