*  good jokes. All right, true. Andrew, I think I feel like that was a dick to me. But okay, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=35.04s)]
*  Andrew Schultz is here. Thank you for having me. Schultz pleasure. You just you got to you're on [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=38.96s)]

*  your Netflix special is crushing it top 10 around the world. It's called life. Yeah, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=50.08s)]
*  l i f e. Pretty cool. It's about your low sperm count. I am the face of sperm. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=56.16s)]
*  Which that's kind of like crazy because you've got a mustache of a 70s porn star. How is it [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=64.48s)]
*  coming overcompensating? You know, I think I got to trick people with the stash. What a reality. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=69.52s)]
*  Yeah, the balls you're firing blanks. It's bad. Yeah, it's this special is so good. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=73.92s)]
*  I appreciate it. We all watched it. We were it's hilarious. And you got three old guys here who [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=83.76s)]
*  also have had to deal with some of these issues. We've all had to have IVF. You guys do IVF for the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=90.16s)]
*  babies. Chamath, you want to be honest here? Or are you are you all natural? Did you hit the three [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=95.28s)]
*  from half court logo shot? What happened? My first four kids were natural. My fifth was IVF. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=99.68s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, I don't think we're surprised. There's like two billion of you guys, you know, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=104.48s)]
*  it's easy to get the job done. There is a period after the Facebook IPO, I swear to God, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=109.36000000000001s)]
*  I would look at chicks on Instagram and get them pregnant. It was really brutal. Are they coming [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=115.68s)]
*  to collect? Hope not. How many supplements you got, Chamath? How many ideas? All right, freeburg. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=120.4s)]
*  I like this episode. Yeah, we're off to a hot start here. Freeburg, you look like you have a [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=127.84s)]
*  low sperm count, but you have a fourth kid on the way. But apparently, what's the story? Are you [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=132.0s)]
*  au natural? This is for the first time ever. Nobody knew this breaking news. Freeburg au natural with [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  your 3.5 babies. 100% Wow, a vegan who's shooting with a sniper rifle. I don't believe it. I don't [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=143.6s)]
*  believe it. I'll find you guys a great study about veganism and libido. Is that right? Yeah, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=153.92s)]
*  very impressive. What does it do? Reduce the woman's? Exactly. Exactly. Oh my God. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  I know a place with the best roast cauliflower. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  By the way, can I just tell you how much I hate cauliflower everywhere I go? That is the dish. I [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=183.92s)]
*  had it for dinner. It's a main course. It's disgusting. There's two things they offer you [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=191.11999999999998s)]
*  portobello mushroom and roasted cauliflower. That's what Sean does every time you show up at the house. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  Are you are you a impossible meat guy? No, I don't like that stuff. It's gross. Okay. Okay. Yeah. By [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=203.44s)]
*  the way, you guys want to hear a quick science corner? So you know how we talked about Yamanaka [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=209.52s)]
*  factor is a roaring yes. Anyway, let me let me hit this real quick because I know we're never going [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=213.68s)]
*  to get to it because you guys just bullsh** around talking about politics. Science talk shelter. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=225.36s)]
*  You know how you can use Yamanaka factors. We talked about these to basically turn a cell into [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=232.08s)]
*  a stem cell. Right? Of course. And that's what goes on in the lab. Andrew, you're familiar with the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  Yamanaka factor. Everybody knows about the Yamanaka factors. You've been all over it for a while. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=241.12s)]
*  Dude, I've seen squid game. Yeah, absolutely. I don't know about the Yamanaka factor. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=245.68s)]
*  I can tell you. Yamanaka factor. Everybody knows about it. You didn't [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=253.68s)]
*  visit the Yamanaka factory when you were in Kyoto? I went to the Yamanaka factor. I swear to God, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=257.6s)]
*  I got showed up 15 minutes late and stabbed himself in the stomach right there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=262.8s)]
*  He killed himself right there. Yeah, it's called Sudoku. Exactly. Sudoku. Sudoku. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=267.76s)]
*  He did Sudoku in under a minute. Sudoku. Okay, nevermind. We'll come back to the science corner. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=272.56s)]
*  Tell us. Tell us. So the interesting work going on right now is you basically can take any cell [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  from a person's body, turn it into a stem cell, and then turn that stem cell ultimately into an [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=286.0s)]
*  egg cell. So you no longer need to go harvest eggs. And so you don't need to actually go get [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=292.0s)]
*  the eggs from the woman. You can make eggs from skin cells, for example. So in the next couple [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=297.12s)]
*  of years, there's a few little technical breakthroughs that are happening right now [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=302.96s)]
*  that will enable this, where fertility clinics may end up just taking a little bit of your skin cell, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=306.56s)]
*  creating stem cells, creating egg cells, and that's how we're going to end up doing IVF in [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=312.4s)]
*  the future at any age. So you can make eggs at any age, and you can ultimately [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=316.08s)]
*  produce offspring at any age. You don't need to actually have active healthy eggs. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=321.2s)]
*  And this... You like that one, right? You like that one. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=325.12s)]
*  Because this is a nice workaround for the people that are trying to ban IVF because of the abortion [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=328.8s)]
*  protocol. Because it basically likely begins a conception as part of their belief, right? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=335.12s)]
*  But and the idea... You could take one egg cell, you could take one... [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=340.64s)]
*  Exactly. ... make a fertilized egg. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=343.76s)]
*  Yeah. For those people who don't know, but like what you do with IVF is you try to harvest as [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=345.84s)]
*  many as you possibly can because not all of them are viable, and it's a pretty brutal process for [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=348.72s)]
*  the woman to go through. But if you could just grab something from the skin, you'd have almost [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  unlimited egg... When a woman is born, she has all her eggs in her body, and as she ages, those eggs [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=357.20000000000005s)]
*  get depleted, and eventually she doesn't have very good viable eggs left over. So this gets around [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=362.56s)]
*  that problem of not having viable eggs. We can be very selective about the eggs. And so there's a [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=367.12s)]
*  future here in the next couple of years where fertility becomes simpler, hopefully easier, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=372.16s)]
*  and more widely available service than it is today, where it's really challenging technically, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=378.16s)]
*  and you've got to go do something that's invasive, and you've got to hope that there's good healthy [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  eggs, and there's a good number of eggs, and so on and so forth. So really interesting science. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=388.24s)]
*  This is awesome. Shultz, did they sit you down and give you the embryos that were viable and the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=392.08000000000004s)]
*  grades and the gender, and you pick one? And what did you pick? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=398.72s)]
*  We just picked the best. So this is a lot of pressure on that first one. All the other kids [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=401.6s)]
*  afterwards, I feel like don't have as much. Yeah, come out of the gate strong, have a good [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=405.76s)]
*  first quarter, whatever. That's all good. So I got to ask you, wait, you didn't say if you [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=410.08s)]
*  had to, I was about to, I'm about to put it out there. I didn't have IVF. Okay. But the first time [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=416.08s)]
*  we had the first kid, wife says, Hey, we're all I'm ovulating. I said, put me in the game. Boom, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  first shot, half court logo pregnant. Wow. Then she says, I want to wait before I have the next [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=428.24s)]
*  one. It's a little traumatic to have a kid and she waits six years. Then we try for a year, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=434.56s)]
*  nothing for one year. So now I'm like, man, we waited too long. It's a lot of pressure. You [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=439.76s)]
*  talk about this in the special. It's like for women, this is anxiety producing. So she's like, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=444.88s)]
*  you got to go get checked out. And this is when the most humiliating day of my life occurred. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=449.36s)]
*  I don't know, Andy, what it was like when you went, but they found all these grifters. Can they, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=454.96s)]
*  can they identify grifters through the microscope? No, no, no. I walk in and the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=460.96s)]
*  thing opens and there's three women at the counter at the reception. And they're like, Hey, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  Jason, hella can ish. You're here to give up, you know, I'm like, yeah, I am. And then they walk you [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=469.2s)]
*  to a room. Oh, that's the spookiest thing. They walk you to a room and then they open it up. And [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=475.12s)]
*  it's like some nightmare scenario where there's a motel eight room and there's a couch that's about [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=479.28s)]
*  three feet wide and there's a towel on it. And there's a towel on it. And that sofa is not [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=488.08s)]
*  clocked for a reason. It needs to be cleanable. It's very much like the hotel you're in. I don't [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=492.48s)]
*  know what's going on with the Netflix budget. Maybe they could put you in the Four Seasons or [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=501.04s)]
*  the peninsula. It's so brutal. So you did this, right? You had to go. The grainy television with [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=505.28s)]
*  the porn. It's like, Oh, you're lucky you got the TV. I went to the phone. I went to the phone. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=511.28s)]
*  Nothing. I didn't even have any service in there, which was like another thing that was it was [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=517.44s)]
*  annoying. So what did you do? You roll it? No, bank bank. You have to go to the bank. That's [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=522.1600000000001s)]
*  what I'm talking about. The Rolodex. You roll through all the memories about the memories, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=526.24s)]
*  man, of my wife and only my wife, nobody else. That's what I was saying. All those great moments [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=529.9200000000001s)]
*  with all those great moments. Maybe there was accidentally one or two that got left in from [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=535.6800000000001s)]
*  when you were on the road. It's possible. Some like absolute would jump into the dreams that I [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=540.8000000000001s)]
*  had with my wife. That might be possible. I would never want them to be there. No, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=546.24s)]
*  obviously. That was the director's cut. There's nothing I could do. But yeah, it is also funny [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=550.32s)]
*  how like we dramatize our experience. We got the easiest thing to do in the whole thing. We just [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=554.08s)]
*  got to go into a room and jerk off as if that's hard for us. But we're like, the room is destitute [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  and brutalist and the furniture was uncomfortable. Speaking of jerk offs. Yeah. Speaking of [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=564.08s)]
*  jerk offs. Gavin Newsom's got a podcast. This is so I think that this is like, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=574.08s)]
*  this is a great idea. Despite what you think about his politics. Is he a plastic bag in the wind? Yes. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=580.8000000000001s)]
*  But it is a great demonstration of like how Americans admire bravery or courage. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=587.84s)]
*  And we don't like put is I think that's what the Democrats kind of displayed in the last election. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=595.36s)]
*  I want to get too political about this. Like, I'm sorry, but like your opinion, one man's a [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=599.5200000000001s)]
*  it's more just like I responded culturally. I don't give a **** about the tribalism in politics, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=603.6s)]
*  but I'll just be honest with you. So having him have like Charlie Kirk right there, who's like a [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=607.52s)]
*  professional arguer that he is, whatever, you know how like some people are autistic for dinosaurs, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=612.48s)]
*  he's that for arguing, right? And like sit across from him to even address the French laundry. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=618.24s)]
*  I was like, okay, this is actually the right thing to do. So as, as easy as it is for us to sit here [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=626.16s)]
*  and go, okay, this guy wants just wants to be president. Like, this is a dumb thing, like, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=633.2s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. It's actually what the Democrats should be doing. So I think we need to reward. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=636.88s)]
*  I think we need to reward this behavior. We want more conversation. We want conversation with [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=643.12s)]
*  people, especially that like you may disagree with. And like the second podcast he put out, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=648.6400000000001s)]
*  I thought was the most impactful. There was one piece that was incredibly impactful. He's talking [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=653.84s)]
*  to some guy. I don't know who he was somebody that grew up in like San Francisco. He's like, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=658.0s)]
*  Mike Savage, Mike Savage. You know, he was talking about the taxes and like, he's paying all this [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=661.44s)]
*  money in taxes in California. And what does he get from it? And then Newsom said that like, yeah, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=666.6400000000001s)]
*  rich people are going to pay more, but your actual like functional tax rate, if you're middle class [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=671.6800000000001s)]
*  would be more if you lived in Florida, because of the other stuff you get taxed on. This is the [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=677.2s)]
*  type of information that like you guys might be privy to, but the average person doesn't, they [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=684.0s)]
*  hop on. He's like being human and addressing real issues instead of like culture war issues and [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=688.16s)]
*  well, just talking like, I think he's going culture war, like that's culture war, but he's actually [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=695.36s)]
*  putting out valuable information that defends the positions he may have taken in government [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=700.16s)]
*  that the average person doesn't really know. Like the average person like me just goes, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=706.88s)]
*  all right, I'm in New York. I'm getting clipped at 50% and 5% city tax. Like I'm getting crushed. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=710.16s)]
*  But if I lived in Florida or Texas, I'd say 13%. And it'd be a complete wash. When there might be [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=715.9200000000001s)]
*  someone making 50 grand a year, and they move from California to Texas, and they lose money. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=722.0s)]
*  And they don't know that. Because they're just listening to rich guys on podcasts, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=726.5600000000001s)]
*  talk about how much money they save when they move to Texas. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=729.52s)]
*  You don't have to take a shot on this. But yeah, okay. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=731.84s)]
*  I moved to Texas this year, more of a shot at me and free bird, but go. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=734.96s)]
*  Okay. Chum up your thoughts on Gavin's new podcast. What do you think you you know, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=738.24s)]
*  there was famously a little dip of the toe where somebody made a podcast, I'm sorry, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=744.48s)]
*  landing page that you were going to run for governor. We had a little fun with that. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=749.76s)]
*  What do you think of Gavin? What do you think of his podcast? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=752.9599999999999s)]
*  I think he's an excellent politician. It's clear he's starting the 2028 campaign. Okay. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=755.68s)]
*  I think he's done a really good job so far. I think Schultz is right. He is unwinding all of the [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=761.28s)]
*  the kind of like landmines that the Democrats have stepped on. I think he's learned what Kamala did [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=767.68s)]
*  wrong. And now he's taking this very narrow path, which is like, I'm going to basically disavow all [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=775.68s)]
*  the stuff that people don't care about. So all the gender woke ideology stuff, I don't think you're [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=783.12s)]
*  going to hear him talk about. He'll try to drive a narrow wedge on these economic issues. So I don't [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=788.16s)]
*  know. I mean, I think it's going to create a really dynamic 2028 campaign if he gets momentum, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=794.24s)]
*  by the way, his popularity has gone up, which is insane, which after the fires, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=799.44s)]
*  and all of the ineptitude in California, all of the corporations that have run away all of the [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=806.4s)]
*  people that have left the chaos in San Francisco. After all of that, he started a podcast and his [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=811.76s)]
*  popularity has gone up. It's really incredible. Coming around the horn. Friedberg, what do you [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=818.4s)]
*  think of Gavin Newsom? Look, I think the podcast was brilliant. I think when I watched it, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=822.56s)]
*  I was hooked, because there are two things that I think were critical in how he runs it. Firstly, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=828.8s)]
*  is he is showing for the first time, I think that I have ever seen a Democrat do or Republican [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=836.3199999999999s)]
*  in modern politics, active listening to the other side. It seems so crazy that this is some sort of [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=844.4s)]
*  special event and special concept, but this active listening moment where you see a politician, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=851.28s)]
*  it totally breaks down the walls where you immediately feel on guard or on offense against [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=858.0799999999999s)]
*  that person. Because if someone's actively listening to you, you actually feel like you're [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=864.24s)]
*  on the same side somehow, and you're trying to come to a conclusion together. And so what that [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=868.72s)]
*  does is it invites the person on the other side, in this case, the audience, the listener, to be [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=872.88s)]
*  with Gavin, part of the kind of coming together. The second thing I think he did that's really [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=877.36s)]
*  brilliant is so much of the modern political bimodalism where you're in one camp or the other [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=881.6s)]
*  means that everything is a one or a zero. Andrew talked about this. We're all generally, I think, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=887.92s)]
*  none of us would consider ourselves political party affiliates. We are all generally people that like [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=893.52s)]
*  to think for ourselves on a topic or an issue, and we don't care about what party is associated. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=898.96s)]
*  But the way modern politics has evolved is you don't debate the topics, you debate the one or [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=903.76s)]
*  the zero because of what the party says. My party says this is the position, therefore I'm a one and [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=909.2s)]
*  you're a zero. And the other side says I'm the one, you're the zero, meaning everything has to be [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=914.96s)]
*  binary. I'm completely right, you're completely wrong. And I think what Gavin has done is he's [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=920.08s)]
*  shown that these are not ones and zeros, they're 80-20 or 60-40 or 55-45. And he's willing to [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=924.88s)]
*  acknowledge that. He's showing that, you know what, we might be only 45% right. And on so many [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=931.76s)]
*  topics, the Democratic Party has ended up slightly wrong. They're 45-55. It's not that they're a zero [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=937.68s)]
*  or a one. They're slightly off on taxes, they're slightly off on social issues, and they're off [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=944.72s)]
*  just enough that they lost the election. They're not just enough that they lost the election. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=948.96s)]
*  Breast tax. Andrew, 2028, Trump's running for his third term versus Gavin Newsom. Who do you vote for? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=952.64s)]
*  I mean, we gotta run it back for a third term for Trump. No doubt. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=958.4s)]
*  No, obviously, I believe. No, but theoretically, if it wasn't a third [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=963.92s)]
*  term, Gavin versus Trump, who would you go? I mean, I gotta see what his policies are, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=966.88s)]
*  and I gotta see where America is. I think the big misunderstanding with this last election is that [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=971.84s)]
*  at least the Democrats who are still trying to vilify these figures on the right, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=976.8s)]
*  what they don't understand is they think that this was some populist election where people just [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=981.68s)]
*  fell in love with Trump and they just loved it so much they would just do whatever he says. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=985.92s)]
*  What I think is harder for them to grapple with is the self-reflection of a rejectionist vote. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=990.64s)]
*  So I think people rejected the Democratic proposal. 100%. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=998.3199999999999s)]
*  And they went with what the other alternative was, which was Trump. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1003.12s)]
*  Exactly correct. And that's a way tougher pill to swallow. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1007.28s)]
*  You have to look back at everything you've done and go, wow, we're off, we're not listening to the [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1010.16s)]
*  people. This guy listens to the people. I mean, it seems like I'm fluffing Trump here, but like, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1014.16s)]
*  I would say that his greatest skill is listening to what people say. And I think a lot of times [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1019.28s)]
*  there's this Ivy League pretentiousness in the Democratic Party where it's like, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1024.72s)]
*  we know it's better for you. And I know you say you want these things you don't really want that. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1029.92s)]
*  Let us, we've studied and we've talked about it in our little thought experiments in class. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1035.12s)]
*  So we know what you need. You just shut up. It's condescending. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1039.68s)]
*  So I think that like when people go, ah, the food is giving me cancer. And then he [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1046.0800000000002s)]
*  appoints the guy who says the food is bad to run the food. The American people go, well, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1050.72s)]
*  that kind of seems like a good thing. I like that. It is an acute understanding and listening to [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1055.68s)]
*  what people are saying. And sometimes to his disadvantage, like he came out against that. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1062.88s)]
*  They were putting some like tax on people who drive into Manhattan or whatever, like [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1070.48s)]
*  congestion pricing and pricing. Initially people really rejected it. Right. And then, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1076.0s)]
*  so he was like, we're getting rid of congestion pricing. And like two weeks after they put that [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1082.24s)]
*  congestion pricing thing, everybody I knew with a car was like, this is the greatest thing. The [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1086.16s)]
*  city is, you can actually move, right? You can take a taxi and it's faster than the subway. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1091.12s)]
*  Overreach is good. The bureaucracy is nice. Like you want a car, stay in the boroughs. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1096.7199999999998s)]
*  Exactly. So you don't get a car in Manhattan. Explain this to people. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1103.04s)]
*  It's a little bit egregious. I mean, you and I do Jason, but everybody else should have it. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1106.1599999999999s)]
*  Exactly. Our lives should be different. You know what I mean? Absolutely. Absolutely. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1110.32s)]
*  What's the point of us having nice cars? If we can't drive them whenever we want. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1114.56s)]
*  Yes. Yes. And you know, we grew up at a time on the Lower East Side. You know, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1119.28s)]
*  you could go to Tribeca. We could go to a club limelight. You could park outside the limelight [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1123.84s)]
*  at night. You could go to Palladium. You could park on 14th street. I parked right on 14th street. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1127.52s)]
*  Okay. I go to a church, right? And then, you know, I sniff, can you say something ecstasy? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1131.3600000000001s)]
*  You do a little whatever, but it's four in the morning. Listen, you two goofballs between your [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1136.48s)]
*  stupid mustache and your ozempic turkey neck. I am totally for it. Go to something useful. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1141.76s)]
*  Are we going to let Chamath sit there in MacGyver's funeral outfit, tell us that we're goofballs? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1149.12s)]
*  I don't know. This guy. This guy is wearing a vest with a collar. He looks like he's going to [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1155.68s)]
*  a Punjabi wake. I can't believe that he would even talk about the way that your dress and how you [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1159.36s)]
*  look. This is custom Lora Piano, boys. This is Lora Piano. Really? What does it look like? You got it [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1165.52s)]
*  at Zara. All right, listen. More importantly, let's stay on track. Yes. Yes. We got to stay on track. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1170.8s)]
*  Can I tell you guys something about tariffs from a layman? Yeah. You guys are acutely aware of [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1176.72s)]
*  maybe how these things affect markets and yada yada yada. And most people don't have any fucking [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1182.6399999999999s)]
*  clue. So the average person, right? I look at this and I'm like, man, it kind of sucks that you got [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1186.56s)]
*  to like negotiate your like your bid for a car that you're going to buy publicly, right? So this [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1194.96s)]
*  is my assumption. And maybe I'm like a little bit more optimistic than most about the administration. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1201.2s)]
*  But if I go to buy a car, the car is listed 100 K and I go off of the guy 80, right? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1205.52s)]
*  I don't want everybody around me yelling out that how can you insult him by offering him 80? This is [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1213.3600000000001s)]
*  an insult. And then I, I can't go to them and I go, I'm actually trying to settle at 90. I'm just [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1218.48s)]
*  saying 80. So he comes down a little bit. But the unfortunate thing when you litigate these things [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1223.76s)]
*  in front of the entire world is that they look at that first measure. There's 200% tax and Trump [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1228.24s)]
*  can't balk at it. He can't go, yo, I'm just fucking, I'm just playing around with that number. I [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1233.28s)]
*  actually just getting them to come down 20% or 10% getting them to come down. Anything is a win. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1237.36s)]
*  He can't say that because he loses all his leverage. So he's got to sit here and then get [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1242.24s)]
*  criticized by, I don't know if it's half the country. I don't know, you know, who really ends [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1245.52s)]
*  up caring about what these tariffs do. Obviously, there are repercussions in the market. I got a [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1249.76s)]
*  buddy of mine building a hotel out of Joshua Tree and he's like, I don't even know if I can get [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1253.76s)]
*  brought into the country from Canada. So it does affect people in real time. But it's impossible [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1257.6s)]
*  to do these negotiations with any leverage if you have the people within your own country [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1262.0s)]
*  questioning your ability to negotiate in real time. That is what the layman would think. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1266.72s)]
*  Well, I do think you're right in the sense that in the early days, when Trump was talking about [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1271.84s)]
*  tariffs, initially everyone was like, oh my God, he's going to use tariffs. He's unpredictable. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1276.8s)]
*  And then the narrative became he's using it as a negotiating tactic. The problem is just like in [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1280.8799999999999s)]
*  poker, once everyone knows that there is this kind of action, it's exploitable. And so this is now [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1286.72s)]
*  kind of an exploitable mode of negotiation where everyone now assumes he's just trying to negotiate [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1292.96s)]
*  so no one actually takes him seriously. The question now is the response going to be that he's [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1298.08s)]
*  going to be serious about it? Or is he actually exploitable? And you saw what China's response [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1302.24s)]
*  was, I kind of view China as like AI, like stuff goes into China, the AI processes it and it comes [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1307.36s)]
*  back out. China is like, obviously, the way they're kind of structured, you have very little [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1312.56s)]
*  psychosocial bias, like you do with other democratic governments. It's very systematic, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1317.1200000000001s)]
*  it's systematically processed, every piece of data is systematically processed, every action is [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1321.6s)]
*  systematically processed. And so I think when you look at how the Chinese ambassador responded to [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1326.16s)]
*  Trump on Twitter, a few weeks ago, where they're like, you want war, we'll give you war, this is a [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1331.04s)]
*  hot war or cold war, whatever you want. We've never seen that from an ambassador to the United [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1335.2s)]
*  States president before done on Twitter like this, let alone the Chinese ambassador. So I think it [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1339.28s)]
*  says a lot about how the Chinese AI is processing the Trump negotiating tactic or the Trump positioning [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1344.8799999999999s)]
*  statements on tariffs, which indicates that there may be now, I mean, we can talk about what game [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1350.96s)]
*  theory optimal play might be in this kind of poker game, what's going to come next. But there's a [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1355.44s)]
*  real assessment that they've made on how far he is willing to take it. They've got a conclusive [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1360.24s)]
*  statement, and they believe that this is the fastest way to kind of win their negotiating [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1364.48s)]
*  position. But it says a lot about where this is all going. Everyone now understands or views this [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1367.52s)]
*  as an exploitable moment, which unfortunately means that tariffs may not work, or they're actually [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1372.0s)]
*  going to have to stick, which can be really ugly. Yeah, it could be painful. Could be painful. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1376.4s)]
*  For sure. Matthew, your thoughts on the tariffs and Andrew's position? What is the I think it's, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1381.84s)]
*  it's like 120 some odd years, Nick, maybe you can find this tweet that I had, but almost the majority [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1386.8s)]
*  of years as a nation, or close to a majority of the years as a nation, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1392.56s)]
*  we had no income tax. And the way that we would fund the programs that we needed was not from [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1399.12s)]
*  insiders, but from outsiders. And that's where the tariff was born, right? It's people domestically [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1406.6399999999999s)]
*  in America don't pay any taxes on the things that they do. And instead, if you'd like to sell into [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1413.52s)]
*  the United States, you pay a reasonable tax. So this is the so many years. So it's 126 years [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1418.16s)]
*  from 1776 to 1861. Then we paused it for a few years because of the Civil War, we restarted [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1424.4s)]
*  to get in 1872. And you notice when it stopped, when it stopped was right around World War One, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1430.96s)]
*  where this entire war machine broke out and we've never looked back. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1436.24s)]
*  So I don't know, I think that one way to think about this is we're probably going to go back [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1439.6s)]
*  and explore. Isn't it better if we have this incredibly vibrant and rich country of 330 million [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1445.28s)]
*  people with a ton of purchasing power? What happens if we put the burden, not on them to fund the [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1453.44s)]
*  American infrastructure and social programs and safety net, but if we put the burden on all the [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1460.48s)]
*  companies in the other 7.7 billion people in the world and the 185 plus countries [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1466.96s)]
*  that want access to these folks? Should there be exceptions? Probably. Should there be waivers [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1473.28s)]
*  in very specific and narrow cases? Absolutely. But I think that that's where these guys are going. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1479.2s)]
*  And I think that you heard this, by the way, yesterday from Howard Lutnick, I don't know if [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1485.36s)]
*  you guys saw this, but he said the Trump tax plan is going to cut federal income taxes to zero for [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1489.04s)]
*  anybody making 150 K or less. It's crazy. What would the vulnerability in that be, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1495.44s)]
*  like putting the burden on all of these expenses that we would incur on other countries? What would [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1502.4s)]
*  that vulnerability for us be? There are two. The first is that- [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1509.2s)]
*  If we keep the expenses. That's the key. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1513.04s)]
*  If we keep the tariffs, if we charge them to come into the market, we charge them an extra 25%. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1516.64s)]
*  We talked about this last week. If you cut the budget, then it can be net neutral. That's part [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1521.2800000000002s)]
*  of what they said. Got it. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1525.52s)]
*  But he's saying, what is the strategic vulnerability? I think the strategic vulnerability [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1526.8000000000002s)]
*  is two. The thing with tariffs is, and you're pointing out this, let's just say today you say [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1530.4s)]
*  there's a tariff and then tomorrow you say, oh, we found an agreement and we're going to take it [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1536.3200000000002s)]
*  off the table. One piece of logic would say, wow, that's great. We're able to change our mind on a [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1540.48s)]
*  dime. The problem for countries and companies is that they can't think in 24-hour blocks of time. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1545.84s)]
*  They're making decisions in five and 10-year blocks of time. It's like, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1553.28s)]
*  I'm going to go and borrow a billion dollars. I'm going to go and build a data center. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1556.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm going to borrow $10 billion. I'm going to build tanks. Once you start that, you can't [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1560.72s)]
*  just stop it and then restart it. That's one strategic problem, which is that if you are not [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1566.0s)]
*  careful, some of these markets that are really crucial, I'll give you one which we talked about [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1571.92s)]
*  last week. Right now, 95% of all of the energy we generate in America is from renewables. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1577.2s)]
*  Whether you like it or not, that's just what it is. The reason why that's possible is because [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1582.96s)]
*  America has a very sophisticated market where all these people come from all corners of the world, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1589.2s)]
*  insurance companies, life insurance companies, banks, and they fund all of it. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1595.8400000000001s)]
*  The reason is they can take a tax credit. They can lower their effective tax rate. They get a [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1599.68s)]
*  higher rate of return. It's all super complicated, but the point is these incentives exist. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1605.1200000000001s)]
*  If all of a sudden you play around with that market, half that energy would go away. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1609.44s)]
*  Electricity prices would rise. Inflation goes up. Then if we have to go and compete against China [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1617.2s)]
*  for AI and a bunch of other stuff, where is the energy going to come from? You're going to brown [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1623.44s)]
*  out people. You're going to just turn their energy off so that you can fund a data center [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1627.2s)]
*  so that the TikTok algorithm is better. That's literally what we would have to decide. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1630.96s)]
*  That's one way. Then the second way is if you're providing a critical service or a good [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1635.68s)]
*  to American people for which there is no alternative, that becomes really problematic [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1642.88s)]
*  because that person can then pull that product and say, I can't afford to make it. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1649.1200000000001s)]
*  The obvious example is if you make pharmaceutical drugs for rare diseases, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1653.2s)]
*  what do you do? Again, those are all things that are like multi-decade long decisions. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1658.3999999999999s)]
*  You'd love to make them and unchange them at every 24 hours, but it's just not possible [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1664.6399999999999s)]
*  because you just make these decisions and you're stuck with them for a long time. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1668.72s)]
*  That's where the tariff thing becomes problematic if you change them often enough. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1672.32s)]
*  If you implement them and you're like, this is what it's going to be, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1676.1599999999999s)]
*  the world can adapt and people can figure it out. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1679.9199999999998s)]
*  The other problem is just the communication of this has been terrible. We were on the program [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1682.32s)]
*  last week or two weeks ago, Joe Lonsdale was like, this is about fentanyl. Is it about fentanyl? Is [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1686.0s)]
*  it about getting rid of income tax at the federal level? Is it about supply chain resiliency? These [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1690.72s)]
*  guys get a D in my grade book for communication. It's terrible communication. This idea that you [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1695.52s)]
*  can't take Trump too seriously about his claims, well, he said he was going to overturn Roe v. Wade. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1703.28s)]
*  He did it. He said he was going to close the border and send people home. He did that. You know, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1710.0s)]
*  he said he'd do a Muslim ban. He actually did that. So for every time he says something and [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1714.88s)]
*  you're like, that's cap. No way he's going to do that. I actually think people are starting to [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1719.6s)]
*  realize he's going to do something here with these tariffs. They're not just a negotiating position. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1724.8s)]
*  And the other problem, I think a lot of people have what this is. It centralizes power. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1729.52s)]
*  Anybody can go to Trump now and say, I want an exception. I'm, you know, a car company. I want [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1733.44s)]
*  an exception. I'm a solar company. I, you know, I need an exemption. And then now you've got [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1738.08s)]
*  everybody going to Mar-a-Lago to kiss the ring, to give him a donation, to bow down. And it [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1742.72s)]
*  centralizes more power with them as opposed to having rules. And we need to have rules in this [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1747.52s)]
*  country that apply to everybody, not just people who give a million dollars like Bezos and Tim Cook [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1752.3999999999999s)]
*  and everybody and Zuck the weathervane gave them. We don't want to live in that world where you're [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1757.1999999999998s)]
*  just bribing Trump to get your tariff. And that's how people feel. That's how the business community [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1762.1599999999999s)]
*  feels. That's the reality right now. People are bribing Trump, giving him a million dollars to [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1767.44s)]
*  inauguration to get close to him, to go to Mar-a-Lago. And it looks really bad. You need to have a clear [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1772.0800000000002s)]
*  strategy here for what the rules of the game are. And he's changing the rules. So you have to go to [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1778.16s)]
*  him and he's, he loves that. That's actually, I think what he's trying to do is get everybody to [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1783.6000000000001s)]
*  go through him. It's a really clever hack, I think. Yeah. And perception is reality. So you have to [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1788.24s)]
*  react to people's perception. Like we can throw data points all we want at people and we can throw [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1793.04s)]
*  research and all this other shit. But if people aren't meeting you there, then you're not going [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1797.36s)]
*  to be communicating with them effectively. And I think that's something that like, you know, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1800.8s)]
*  especially you guys need to know. You guys have privity information that the average American [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1805.6s)]
*  probably is not. And we can bitch and complain about how they don't read or how they're not [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1809.28s)]
*  looking up, you know, what happened in 1913 to change the course of American history and how we [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1813.68s)]
*  started tech. Or we can go, okay, we need to find a way to disseminate this information so they can [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1818.56s)]
*  make these decisions and I guess, or feel comfortable with the results of these decisions. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1823.44s)]
*  Do you think America would be okay with this idea of taxing outsiders and then [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1828.56s)]
*  relying on it versus income tax paid by its own citizens? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1835.52s)]
*  I think that the second half is really all that would matter. I think that people are, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1839.8400000000001s)]
*  I think the majority of people are thinking about the next week. So if you say that I don't have to [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1844.48s)]
*  pay taxes, like, and I think this is what Republicans are doing way better than Democrats right now is [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1848.0s)]
*  Democrats don't have build the wall. They don't have slogans. They don't have things that [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1853.52s)]
*  immediately tap into like core emotional feeling, regardless of you're going to do it or not. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1857.6s)]
*  We want Greenland. Okay, that's cool. Democrats need eggs or a dollar. Democrats need things that [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1861.76s)]
*  like echo their sentiments and how they want to like take care of people and provide for the [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1867.28s)]
*  disenfranchised, but it has to be done in a way where it's digestible. You can chew on it. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1871.6s)]
*  If you want to make housing more affordable, then you say, yay, we're seizing public land. We're [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1876.8s)]
*  building 10,000 units. Like you have to tap into what Americans need, which is a feeling of [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1880.4s)]
*  not just comfort. Every American thinks they're going to be a millionaire. That's what this country [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1885.8400000000001s)]
*  drives off. Right? It's every poor American that hope that hope. Yeah. And the second they stop [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1891.2s)]
*  thinking they will be, they can be where they can be. It falls apart. And then some healthcare CEO [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1896.8000000000002s)]
*  gets shot and people celebrate. They're, they're celebrating because they no longer feel the hope [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1903.8400000000001s)]
*  that they could be in that position. They feel so disenfranchised. And this is what like, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1909.12s)]
*  I'm telling you, like the you guys of the world need to pay close attention to because there's [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1915.6799999999998s)]
*  going to be no empathy if anything bad happens. Oh, the stock market is down. No Americans are [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1919.52s)]
*  invested in the stock market. Like that's all you guys. I've been saying it. No, no, no. I've been [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1925.12s)]
*  saying this for months. I've been saying it for months. Nobody cares about the stock market, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1929.12s)]
*  nor should we. And the reason is because we, people who own these assets have overly benefited [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1932.96s)]
*  more than we deserve for the last 15 years. Ever since the great financial crisis in the [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1940.48s)]
*  United States, people who, as Jason said, could cozy up. And by the way, Jason, I think the, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1945.6000000000001s)]
*  the, the claim that you made, which is, is, is severely true for how from 2007 up until now has [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1952.0s)]
*  played out. Because if you look under all the programs, if you could have lobbied Obama in [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1961.12s)]
*  those critical years of the GFC. Yep. Oh my God. The amount of money that was no, because we, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1967.52s)]
*  we took interest rates literally to zero. Anybody like us who could have gone and gotten levered up [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1974.08s)]
*  and gone into the stock market was richly rewarded. And the problem is we left everybody else behind. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1979.12s)]
*  And I think the great thing about Trump is he is going to reset that. He is going to take a lot of [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1985.2s)]
*  wealth away from asset holders. You're seeing it every day. 500 billion, 500 billion. There is no [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1991.68s)]
*  sympathy. I think it's fantastic. That's great. It's great to hear you even saying that because [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=1998.48s)]
*  I feel like a lot of people that are in maybe your guy's position don't understand that disconnect. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2006.32s)]
*  And that is important to understand there. Like even what happened in the palisades, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2012.8s)]
*  like in LA with like the fire, the second people heard it was like rich people's houses. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2017.04s)]
*  There was no empathy for it. They didn't, they don't have a million dollar house. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2021.36s)]
*  You, yeah. It was like, and it is, I don't even have a house. I can't find a house. You burned your [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2024.8s)]
*  house down and you move, you went back, went to your vacation house. Now you, oh, I'm sorry, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2030.32s)]
*  you're living at your ski house. That's a tragedy. Like literally you're right. It probably explains [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2033.68s)]
*  why we don't hear anything in the news anymore about anything that's happening with respect to [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2038.08s)]
*  reconstruction or any of the rich person problem. It's a rich person problem. People, it's a rich [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2041.92s)]
*  person. And you know, I think putting together what you just said, Schultz and you, Trimoth, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2046.8000000000002s)]
*  Trump is a master at connecting with people and listening to them. I thought the, one of the [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2051.84s)]
*  greatest things he, he, he, he did during this last election is when he said no tax on tips, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2056.7200000000003s)]
*  when he said no tax on tips, he was going right for Nevada. He was going right for that swing state, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2062.4s)]
*  you know, to get those folks who live off tips. But what he was also doing is saying, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2067.12s)]
*  I know that there's a bunch y'all that sometimes get cash tips. You put it in your pocket. It's [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2071.52s)]
*  the gray market. I get it. I, you know, I run a whole, you know, I got caddies who get a Hyundai [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2076.48s)]
*  from, you know, whatever, taking somebody out on the course. We're just going to make it official. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2081.28s)]
*  You don't get tax on tips because we know that you're out, you know, you're the bottom third [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2085.44s)]
*  of the country in terms of your economic power. Those kinds of statements really do connect with [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2088.4s)]
*  people. Trump has just mastered this. This party is Trump is the democratic party that we grew up [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2094.2400000000002s)]
*  with. It's kind of crazy. It's kind of crazy, right? And then the Democrats became this elitist [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2099.76s)]
*  group that seemed to be in the pocket of business interest. I don't know what bizarre world we're [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2104.96s)]
*  living. I think you tapped into it right there. It's like, uh, I think that they could easily win [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2108.8s)]
*  the next election if they made it a class war, but they don't because it feels like they're in the [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2114.6400000000003s)]
*  pockets of these billion dollar corporations. So they can't really, I mean, Bernie did it really [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2119.44s)]
*  effectively, right? Like this random Jew that lives in Maine or something like that is like, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2124.96s)]
*  yo, we got to get some money from these rich people, give it back to the poor. And all of [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2129.76s)]
*  a sudden all of America turned him into like our surrogate grandfather. So you can, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2133.28s)]
*  and then he got shipped by Hillary and the machine. And, and I mean, what did they say [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2138.56s)]
*  about his fans? Like they went very specifically, they were like, he has a, his, the Bernie bros [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2143.76s)]
*  have a sexism and bigotry problem, right? They made them radioactive, right? So now you killed [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2148.96s)]
*  the working class. Now the working class is no longer supporting the democratic party. So who [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2155.92s)]
*  do they have left? They have the identity politics groups. So they can't piss off the identity [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2159.44s)]
*  politics groups. Cause they're like, that's all we got left. They did the same with us during the [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2164.48s)]
*  election, right? They're like the podcast bros have a sexism and bigotry probably. They try to make [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2168.88s)]
*  people radioactive. And it's like that card's been played so many times that people are [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2174.0s)]
*  don't work anymore. I think there's one big shoe left to drop. I think we've started the process [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2177.8399999999997s)]
*  of really, really taking a bunch of heat out of the asset markets, like equities. So we've taken [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2182.24s)]
*  trillions and trillions of dollars of wealth away. I think we're going to take trillions more, but [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2187.2s)]
*  the next big market, and this is actually where Andrew, to your point, we reestablish some hope. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2192.08s)]
*  I think for a lot of people is we are going to whack the housing market. It's just going to happen. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2197.36s)]
*  And let me just say something about that. How is that going to happen? Jamoth explain it. Cause [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2202.48s)]
*  there are 7 million homes that we still need to build to service just current demand. How does [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2205.92s)]
*  that actually happen with the supply demand problem in your mind? There are a bunch of mechanisms [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2211.04s)]
*  that have to get cleaned up right now. So one mechanism is that there are a whole host of [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2217.28s)]
*  mortgages that are basically being propped up. It was a program that's that really got out of control [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2223.52s)]
*  under the Biden administration. Nick, you can find this article in the wall street journal. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2230.56s)]
*  We are going to figure out how to get these two government related agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2234.24s)]
*  Mack out of what's called conservatorship. And these are the folks that are responsible for [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2240.24s)]
*  essentially wrapping guarantees around mortgages so that the mortgage market can function. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2244.16s)]
*  The details don't particularly matter that much, but the point is that what we are doing is we [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2250.3199999999997s)]
*  are unwittingly propping up with American taxpayer dollars, the U S housing market. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2256.4s)]
*  Why is that bad? It is locking an inordinate number of people from that first critical step [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2264.56s)]
*  that actually makes them feel like they are winning and they're on their way to achieving [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2271.52s)]
*  their dreams, which is can I make a deposit on a home and then can I live this out? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2275.52s)]
*  And you have these artificially inflated prices all around the country as a result of this. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2280.48s)]
*  So I think this next wave is deeply beneficial to the middle class, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2286.4s)]
*  which is there is no reason like you guys see it when you read the wall street journal. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2291.6800000000003s)]
*  I think it is the dumbest in the world when I see an article, which is like this house just is [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2296.96s)]
*  $65 million on 0.4 acres in some rando place in Miami. Yeah, I was thinking Malibu, but yeah, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2301.2000000000003s)]
*  but what is this? This makes no sense. And so when you re rationalize a bunch of equity values [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2309.36s)]
*  and you re rationalize the cost of a home, I think what you're going to do is you're going [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2318.6400000000003s)]
*  to allow a lot more people to find a more reasonable way to enter the housing market. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2323.92s)]
*  And I do think that that's a really big step in allowing them to feel like they're part of the [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2328.1600000000003s)]
*  dream. So you lower asset prices, you can own some stocks, maybe you own a 401k or if you've [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2331.6800000000003s)]
*  never had a 401k, but your employer offers it for the first time, it may actually make financial [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2338.16s)]
*  sense to put a small amount of it in there. You've never been able to own a home. All of [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2343.2799999999997s)]
*  a sudden, home prices are whacked 30 or 40%. You're able to do that because of how Trump goes after [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2347.12s)]
*  the budget. When his rate of borrowing for the U.S. government goes down, your mortgage rate goes [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2352.7999999999997s)]
*  down. Now all of a sudden you can enter in because home prices are less and you can actually get a [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2358.3999999999996s)]
*  mortgage. They may all seem very random, but they can come together in giving 50, 60 million people [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2362.24s)]
*  a shot that they have been screaming since the great financial crisis they don't have. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2370.0s)]
*  This is so huge because on like a core emotional level, you want as many Americans as possible [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2373.68s)]
*  invested in American success and excellence. And the greater the delta between like them and their [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2380.16s)]
*  first home or their first investment in stock, the greater that distance, the more disillusioned [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2388.0s)]
*  they become in America in general. When they feel like, like you said earlier, like the way that you [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2392.88s)]
*  guys got into the market when you could basically take out loans for nothing and then you saw these [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2397.52s)]
*  incredible gains, they feel left behind. The second they feel like they're in on it, they own an apartment, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2401.44s)]
*  they own some shares of Tesla. That's why crypto is so popular because they're like, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2406.88s)]
*  it feels like it's their only access. Yeah, it's like comedy in some ways, like all I need is a [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2410.72s)]
*  microphone or music. Like there's a path for me. And crypto obviously is a giant scam. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2416.16s)]
*  It's a scam, sure. But I can get a piece of this. I can get a piece of this, this American dream. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2421.2799999999997s)]
*  And I would rather that they were invested in the, you know, a Vanguard account or something like [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2426.3999999999996s)]
*  that. I would rather they're invested in the entire market. I mean, there's this, this idea, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2431.3599999999997s)]
*  and I'm sure you poke holes and tons of holes into it. And, but this idea like every American [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2435.2799999999997s)]
*  born gets a thousand bucks put into a Vanguard account. Yeah. It's a friend of ours, Brad Gershwin with this [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2440.3199999999997s)]
*  invest America is the concept. And regardless if the concept is good or not, the emotional [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2444.64s)]
*  connectivity to the success of American industry is really important. When you know at 22, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2449.44s)]
*  that you could get this thing that's been compounded for 22 years, you could pay off some college loans, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2456.0s)]
*  you could put something down on a house, you could pay for trade school, whatever it is. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2460.24s)]
*  I think you have a different energy towards America and its success. And then you have a [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2463.92s)]
*  lot less of these kids who are just like America's this horrible place and capitalism is bad. Yeah, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2468.0s)]
*  capitalism's bad when you're left behind when you're invested in capitalism. It's great. Baby. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2471.92s)]
*  Absolutely. We're on the express train. Let me give you guys. I did an analysis. I was, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2477.44s)]
*  I wasn't sure if I should put it out, but I'll tell you guys the numbers. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2483.04s)]
*  The U S social security program is meant to be kind of the retirement program for folks that [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2487.6800000000003s)]
*  don't have access to private retirement accounts. Okay. And this program was set up in the 1930s [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2493.36s)]
*  after the great depression. And there's a trust fund, the OASDI, which is the fund that they [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2500.48s)]
*  invest the capital. So every year we all put money in with our social security taxes out of our [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2506.96s)]
*  paychecks goes in there and it gets invested. You know what it gets invested in? It gets invested [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2510.72s)]
*  in one thing, U S treasuries, which have averaged about 4.8% return since the beginning of the [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2516.56s)]
*  program for a year. Meanwhile, what if you put it into the market? Meanwhile, the S and P has [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2523.68s)]
*  been averaging 11%. So here's the math. If in 1971, which was the year that we went off the gold [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2527.68s)]
*  standard in the United States, if we invested the social security trust fund in the S and P, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2534.08s)]
*  the balance of the social security trust fund today would be $15 trillion. That would be roughly [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2539.04s)]
*  one third of the value of the total S and P 500, which would be jointly owned by all Americans [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2545.2s)]
*  who took their capital. Now here's what's up. What's up is that the middle-class people who [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2551.12s)]
*  had access to private retirement accounts benefited by buying the S and P 500 and the wealthy were [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2556.48s)]
*  able to access it. So all of the equity value that accrued from American enterprise and the [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2561.44s)]
*  prosperity of the American system accrued to the people that had access to the private accounts. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2566.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, the people that only had access to the public accounts got stuck owning treasuries. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2570.64s)]
*  Today, the social security trust fund has $2.7 trillion balance and based on the outflows and [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2575.68s)]
*  inflows, it's going to go bankrupt in 2032. That means social security is either going to get cut [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2580.4s)]
*  or the fed's going to print a ton of money to keep social security benefits. Retirement age goes [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2586.0s)]
*  up a little bit. Yes, a lot of levers. Yeah. Wow. So I did the math. If you assume that the S and P 500 [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2590.16s)]
*  continues to grow at 10 and a half percent a year on average, there's ups and downs and sure there [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2595.92s)]
*  could be basically drawdowns and all these other sorts of things. But here's the important point. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2600.24s)]
*  We could put about $500 billion in the trust fund today and it will not go bankrupt again. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2604.56s)]
*  And it will continue to grow every year. And then all Americans have participation in American [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2609.2s)]
*  enterprise. And importantly, this becomes the world's largest sovereign wealth fund ever. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2614.24s)]
*  You don't need a separate sovereign wealth fund. We already have one. We have it. It's called the [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2618.3999999999996s)]
*  social security trust fund. And what we've done is we've totally mismanaged it. And I went back to [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2623.04s)]
*  try and understand why this is the case. Why have we only ever bought treasuries early on? The U.S. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2627.6s)]
*  needed someone to loan money. So they basically forced the citizens to loan the government money [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2632.4799999999996s)]
*  in the form of treasuries. But today the social security trust fund owns only less than 10 percent, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2637.04s)]
*  about 8 percent of the total treasury bonds outstanding. The rest are owned by the Fed and [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2642.96s)]
*  foreign investors and private investors and others that want to own it. So why are we forcing all the [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2646.8s)]
*  American citizens to participate? Yeah, we're propping it up for no reason. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2651.04s)]
*  And we're discouraging access. So basically we've created through the social security system, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2653.84s)]
*  we've created the deep inequity we see in this country. If instead we had allowed the social [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2658.64s)]
*  security system to invest in the S&P 500 to buy American enterprises, to fund American businesses, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2663.84s)]
*  then every American would be wealthy. And that middle class that uniquely participated by [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2669.76s)]
*  basically arbitraging the market where they forced the treasury bond yields on the poor [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2674.88s)]
*  and they got to take access to the equity yields would have not happened. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2679.92s)]
*  They had 401Ks, right? They had 401Ks. They had a device. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2683.28s)]
*  And they were able to participate with brokerage accounts and buy in the market. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2687.28s)]
*  What we can do right now is we can fix it. And here's an important point. People will then argue, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2689.92s)]
*  oh, well, what if there's a down year, two down years in a row? You know what? We're already going [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2694.48s)]
*  to be printing money to make up the hole in social security. We're not going to let social [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2698.96s)]
*  security go bankrupt. We're not going to let it dry out. So we're already going to print money to [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2702.2400000000002s)]
*  make the social security hole. So if that's the case, we can create a backstop for social security. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2705.92s)]
*  We're going to have to do it either way, but we might as well take on the bail. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2711.52s)]
*  Shultze, go. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2716.4s)]
*  Yeah. No, no, no. Chomath, you were going to say something. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2716.88s)]
*  The reason why we didn't do it goes back to what you said before, which is we had a bunch of very, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2719.92s)]
*  quote unquote, well-educated Ivy League trained people running these institutions. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2726.3199999999997s)]
*  And the feedback, I don't even know what it said, but I can tell you what the memo said. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2731.04s)]
*  There's too much risk. We've sensitized this model. It doesn't make sense. This is the safest thing [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2736.24s)]
*  to do. So it goes back to just like, we need a little bit more practical thinking. Like at [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2741.68s)]
*  the end of the day, why the S&P 500 exists is of all the thousands and thousands and thousands of [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2747.36s)]
*  companies in the world. You know how many companies in the world make more than a billion [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2753.28s)]
*  dollars a year? More than 20,000. And of that 20,000, the S&P 500 is just the 500 best. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2756.88s)]
*  It's the best of the best of the best. So to your point, Freeberg, it didn't take a PhD from [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2766.32s)]
*  Harvard to figure out that if you just owned an index of the absolute 500 best things happening [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2771.76s)]
*  at any given point in time, it would have gone up. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2777.52s)]
*  Also, since when are Americans risk intolerant? There's something baked into the DNA of the people [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2780.72s)]
*  that decide to leave their families and move here. Totally. Immigrant country. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2788.8799999999997s)]
*  And to your point, imagine logging in. We've all had, I'm assuming a 401k account, and I remember [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2793.3599999999997s)]
*  how exciting it is to log in and see the account. And Shultz, I want to say something that's really [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2798.3999999999996s)]
*  important. You talk about us people early on, commentary, which is something I hear a lot. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2802.72s)]
*  My first job was making $4.25 an hour cleaning toilets in a pool hall in upstate New York. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2807.44s)]
*  Chamath has similar stories. J. Cal has similar stories. Like any of us that participated- [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2812.88s)]
*  I made $4.55 Canadian working at Burger King. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2817.28s)]
*  Yeah. And then the worst part about my job in the pool hall was that then the manager made me go [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2820.48s)]
*  play poker at his house and he took all the money back, which was really- [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2825.28s)]
*  I stole the chicken fingers at night. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2828.16s)]
*  And bring them home. My mom would whip them up. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2830.56s)]
*  But it was so exciting in my career, in my life, to be able to go from that moment to the moment [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2833.76s)]
*  where I had a 401k and I could log in and I could see the businesses that I owned and I understood [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2839.36s)]
*  that. And I saw the value go up and I got to participate in that. Imagine if every American, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2843.28s)]
*  when you get your social security statement today, all it tells you is a dollar amount and how much [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2847.2000000000003s)]
*  you're going to get in the future. Imagine if you logged in and you got to see all the businesses [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2851.5200000000004s)]
*  you own a piece of. Every single day. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2855.0400000000004s)]
*  And you got to participate. Every single day. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2856.88s)]
*  You feel connected. You would be lighting a Tesla on fire. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2857.6000000000004s)]
*  And by the way, we can solve both the sovereign wealth fund question and the social security [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2860.8s)]
*  trust fund question. Every dollar that's going into these sovereign wealth fund ideas or if they [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2864.8s)]
*  come to fruition or in my opinion, and obviously I haven't spoken to Max about this, but the [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2869.6s)]
*  crypto fund and all this other sort of stuff, every dollar that should go into the social security [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2873.52s)]
*  trust fund. And that social security trust fund should be for the benefit of all Americans. And [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2877.28s)]
*  it should be equities. It should be ownership. It should be participation in what the American [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2881.6800000000003s)]
*  out-dream enabled us all to succeed. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2886.2400000000002s)]
*  The American dream enabled us all to succeed and it should enable everyone else to participate in [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2888.16s)]
*  shares and equity in American enterprise that can come to market. So it's not about a thousand [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2892.64s)]
*  bucks when you're born. It's about an ongoing participation, putting your money in and having [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2896.96s)]
*  that money allocated in a way that's smart and wealthy Americans get to allocate it, which is [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2900.72s)]
*  into owning shares and businesses. That's it. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2906.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2908.48s)]
*  Sheltzy. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2908.56s)]
*  Yeah. No, I think it's great. Hopefully you guys don't feel like I'm like discrediting you by saying [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2909.28s)]

*  No, no, no. I think it's a great, it's an important framing because it's like, you're 100% [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2915.52s)]
*  right. But like, you know, we see comments on YouTube, like, oh, you guys. And I'm like, dude, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2920.16s)]
*  I remember like, it feels like yesterday when I was in frigging debt, I graduated college with a [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2923.7599999999998s)]
*  bunch of debt and I went and like found a job and worked my ass off and I was working 20 hour days [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2929.92s)]
*  and never slept. And like, you know, it wasn't easy. I mean, I feel like very emotional about [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2935.12s)]
*  this right now. Sorry. Hang on. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2939.12s)]
*  It was hard. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2942.8s)]
*  Build the fields, man. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2943.36s)]
*  Listen, it was hard. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2944.32s)]
*  It wasn't easy, bro. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2945.6000000000004s)]
*  It wasn't given to you. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2947.1200000000003s)]
*  None of us inherited. None of us inherited. We came to American and to see the joy, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2948.32s)]
*  to see what we all benefited from. I'm getting emotional about this, but it's like- [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2954.0800000000004s)]
*  Well, the American dream's broken. We gotta fix it. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2957.28s)]
*  Well, no, I need to have- [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2961.28s)]
*  Fix it for us right now. Come on. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2961.92s)]
*  To have people talk about it as if being successful and getting there is a crime. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2962.88s)]
*  It makes you a bad person. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2969.28s)]
*  No, it's a dream. It's a dream. Sheltzy, go. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2970.56s)]
*  I think the framing of this is very important. Like my mom is also an immigrant, right? She [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2972.72s)]
*  came here from Scotland. She has no education. Then she stopped going to school like 14 or [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2977.2s)]
*  something like that. Comes to America and she's this massive success here in terms of like [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2981.04s)]
*  where she came from, where she got to, right? And what she was able to buy. She was able to buy a [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2985.68s)]
*  home in the East Village of New York City. She was able to buy a beach house, like just off of [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2990.0s)]
*  grinding hard work. And what she saw here, which I'm sure a lot of you guys also saw, is opportunity. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=2994.9599999999996s)]
*  She had ambition and opportunity. And I think that that's what, I think a lot of times that's [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3000.8s)]
*  what immigrants see when they come here because they probably come from places where they feel [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3007.6000000000004s)]
*  absolutely no opportunity. So the second they feel like there's a little of it, if they work [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3011.44s)]
*  those 20 hours a week, I mean, I saw my parents grind. Totally. Like my work ethic just comes [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3015.36s)]
*  from watching them. You know what I mean? Just watching them just kill it every single day. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3019.44s)]
*  So what I think that you guys are speaking to, which is really important, and I think it's [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3023.52s)]
*  important that people know your story as well because it becomes more accessible when they see [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3027.68s)]
*  you guys and they know what you came from. They know you're working at Burger King and now you [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3031.52s)]
*  guys are worth billions of dollars. It's very important that Americans know that that's possible [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3034.8799999999997s)]
*  for them. Maybe not to hit a billion, but maybe to hit a million, maybe hit 300,000, maybe to buy a [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3038.72s)]
*  house that's a hundred thousand dollars that they're really proud of. And own it outright. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3044.56s)]
*  And the fact that this is accessible, like what you just said to me is just hope and abundance. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3050.3999999999996s)]
*  That's the messaging of what you just said. You said something that made it seem very simple to [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3055.92s)]
*  me. We put this money here. Everybody's now invested in the success of the American economy. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3059.36s)]
*  And now when we see the stock market ticker look green, which is all the average person sees, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3063.92s)]
*  green or red, we don't really know anything. But when we see green, we get excited. We go, [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3069.36s)]
*  wait, wait. Yeah. And now we start goes up and we start rooting. Come on, feels that way too. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3073.76s)]
*  Yeah. Well, but think about it. He's getting excited right now if you're saying it. But he's [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3079.1200000000003s)]
*  going to start crying. Oh wait, it's green tonight. It's been red for a week. But think about like [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3082.4s)]
*  CEOs, right? Like these people have become villainized, right? And it's because we are [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3086.96s)]
*  not attached to the success of their companies. That's right. When, if you have your biggest [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3092.56s)]
*  holding is Tesla, please believe you're not upset. I think people think that their success now works [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3096.96s)]
*  against your best interests. Yes. And the system's rigged and the system's rigged and you can't be [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3103.04s)]
*  part of it and you're being ground down. This is a, I think really good proposal, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3108.56s)]
*  freeburg. And if you look at housing, that's the other one. I, when I, if I run for president, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3113.04s)]
*  you know what my position is going to be? Chelsea, what's that I'm going to build five cities [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3117.92s)]
*  with 3 million homes in each. And you can only buy them if you make under X amount per year. It's [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3122.0s)]
*  not going to be like the projects or like, you know, subsidized housing in New York talking about, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3127.2799999999997s)]
*  it's not going to be stuyvesant. Okay. It's going to be like nice house. It's pretty good. If you [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3132.08s)]
*  can get it. Yeah. It's like, that's not bad, but not like projects. I'm talking about like proper [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3136.08s)]
*  homes and bill. We are the most innovative country society ever created. I mean, since the Greeks, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3140.4s)]
*  they were pretty great too, but we could build five new cities. Why the can't we build five [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3147.7599999999998s)]
*  new cities with 3 million homes in it? Let's do with some like Manhattan project for housing [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3151.12s)]
*  and then healthcare. How the hell do we not have like good healthcare for everybody in this country [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3155.2799999999997s)]
*  with the richest country in the world, greatest economy, whatever we should be able to solve [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3159.2799999999997s)]
*  those problems. And that's why people don't feel like they're part of this is because basic housing, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3163.04s)]
*  basic healthcare and your retirement. It's not like it's rigged against you. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3168.32s)]
*  This sounds crazy, but for young people, I think they would forgive healthcare if they were invested [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3172.08s)]
*  in the market. And I think it's interesting. Investing in the market is just so daunting, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3179.52s)]
*  but the feeling that everybody else is getting rich when you're not is the reason why I bought [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3184.0s)]
*  crypto, not knowing anything about it. It's the reason why everybody else bought it. It's this [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3189.04s)]
*  feeling that the train is running away and you're not going to be part of it. So how do we get them [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3193.44s)]
*  to feel part of that success? I think really importantly, you know, today, just to give you [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3198.72s)]
*  guys some other statistics, 60% of a middle-class household's net worth is in their home. Only 10% [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3203.36s)]
*  of their net worth is in owning the S&P 500 in index funds or whatever in their retirement accounts. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3210.64s)]
*  So by creating this American dream around housing and allowing the federal government to provide [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3216.3199999999997s)]
*  loans on housing, we've increased the cost of housing. We've created a very destructive housing [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3220.96s)]
*  bubble in the sense that it has reduced people's exposure to participation in productive value [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3225.68s)]
*  creation. And that's through the ownership of businesses. Instead, we've stored our net worth [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3231.36s)]
*  in a house. And in order to keep the economy and the social structure stable, we've created policies [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3236.24s)]
*  that allow the continuation of the growth in the value of houses. So people feel like their net [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3243.28s)]
*  worth is incrementing. And that's unfortunately very unnatural. They restricted making new housing, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3248.0800000000004s)]
*  which makes it worse with the restrictions. Have you guys heard of Warren Buffett's most public [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3254.0s)]
*  failure? No. Warren Buffett's most public failure was when he was brought on as an advisor to Arnold [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3258.32s)]
*  Schwarzenegger when Schwarzenegger was running for governor. And Buffett kind of looked at the laws [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3264.88s)]
*  in California. And there's a law in California when you own a home that when you pass on, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3272.48s)]
*  you can pass it off to your kids and you can basically keep the cost that you paid in terms [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3277.92s)]
*  of setting the real estate taxes. And it's had an enormously negative effect in unlocking turnover [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3283.44s)]
*  of homes. And that's a large driver of why homes are so expensive in California. So Buffett looked [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3291.12s)]
*  at this and there was a lot of fanfare. Schwarzenegger's like, here's my economic genius. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3296.08s)]
*  First thing he said was, guys, I think we should repeal this law. He was gone two days later. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3301.92s)]
*  Wow. And by the way, there's a lot of other policies like this. If you do the true kind of [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3306.16s)]
*  macro analysis as an investor, you should probably have about 20% of your net worth in the US in real [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3314.7200000000003s)]
*  estate, not 60%. And so we need to give people the ability and we need to think about all the [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3319.76s)]
*  follow on and trickle effects of creating a set of laws, a set of policies that basically incentivize [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3325.84s)]
*  almost all of your net worth to go into a single asset, your home. And what that then means in the [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3331.84s)]
*  fact that we have to keep pumping up the value of that home and we have to have a system in order [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3336.2400000000002s)]
*  for people to feel like they're getting ahead, keep inflating and eventually people can't afford [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3339.92s)]
*  homes. And that's where we are today. When did you guys first start your education in the markets? [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3343.6000000000004s)]
*  At what age did you feel like you sought out? I bought my first stock in the company I was working [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3349.68s)]
*  for, or the parent company, the company I was working for in 1989 when I was 18 years old. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3357.9199999999996s)]
*  So 18, what about you, Dave? I bought $300 in stock. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3362.72s)]
*  I signed up for an E-Trade account in college because I saw that TV show called Bull. Do you [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3366.56s)]
*  remember that TV show? It was about investment banking during the dot-com bubble. It was such a, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3372.72s)]
*  no one knows that show. And I was like, man, Wall Street is so cool. I want to learn about stocks [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3376.24s)]
*  because I was an astrophysics major. I didn't know what I was going to do after I was going to go to [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3381.04s)]
*  graduate school or whatever. And then I got caught up in the dot-com bubble and I started reading the [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3385.2s)]
*  Wall Street Journal every day. I would take it down to the freaking plaza and I would read the [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3389.6s)]
*  journal at school during lunch. And I tried to learn about tech and business and markets because [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3393.2799999999997s)]
*  I've always been a tech guy. And I'm like, man, there's all these startups and this is how the [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3397.68s)]
*  markets work. So I set up an E-Trade account. I put some money in it and I started and I bought [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3400.64s)]
*  some stocks and I read the investor business daily on what stocks to buy. They had a rating [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3404.8s)]
*  and I bought those stocks and they went up and I'm like, man, this is awesome. Like I love owning [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3410.48s)]
*  stocks and that kind of kicked me off. And then I got an investment banking job after college and [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3414.4s)]
*  it totally changed my career trajectory. I was like, I want to go work in the tech industry and [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3418.32s)]
*  work in business. What about you, Chamath? And it shifted it up for me. When did you buy your first [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3422.1600000000003s)]
*  equity? But by the way, sorry, let me just say one thing. What you asked is a really important [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3424.88s)]
*  question. I just realized this, Andrew, because my interest in that stock market thing at that time [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3429.28s)]
*  actually changed my career trajectory and it really reset what I was going to do with my life [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3435.1200000000003s)]
*  to get involved in business and go work in the tech industry as opposed to work in science [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3439.36s)]
*  as a researcher. And that was a really big shift for me. So it gave me that kind of a feeling of [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3444.1600000000003s)]
*  like, oh, I got to learn more. And then that kind of changed my career. Sorry, go ahead, Chamath. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3448.96s)]
*  I was 14 or 15 years old and there was a, this is when Rodney King had the kicked out of him and [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3452.72s)]
*  almost died. Well, these race riots in LA and nothing had changed actually in America, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3459.7599999999998s)]
*  but where I was growing up in Canada, the provincial government created a program that said, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3466.7999999999997s)]
*  if you're a minority and you're on welfare, we'll pay for you to get a job. I was a minority on [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3471.68s)]
*  welfare. So I got a job and it was at a startup that was just going parabolic and their stock was [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3478.32s)]
*  going nuclear. And I lived in this part of town and I would see the controller of that company [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3486.56s)]
*  drive past me every day while I was waiting for the bus. And one day he stopped and I went with [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3494.4s)]
*  this guy, Sam Legge. He drove me that whole summer and he taught me what does the company do, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3500.8s)]
*  why is the founder a billionaire, what the hell does this even mean? He unpacked me. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3507.84s)]
*  And so I saw firsthand what it meant to work, not for a salary, but to get a stake in the thing that [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3512.32s)]
*  you're working for. I bought a couple of shares, it went up and it was great. But then I really [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3518.96s)]
*  fell in love with this idea that I could understand something and own a piece of it. And then it really [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3525.76s)]
*  accelerated when I graduated from college because I was like Freeburg, I was in debt and I was like, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3530.88s)]
*  how the do I get out of debt? And I traded stocks on behalf of my boss, this guy, Mike Fisher, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3535.52s)]
*  who I thank to this day. And I made so much money right before the dot com crash. He gave me the [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3542.64s)]
*  money to pay off my student loans. Wow. And then ever since then I was hooked. I was like, okay, [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3549.12s)]
*  I can learn this and I can deal with the vicissitudes of this. Look, the markets are brutal. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3554.48s)]
*  There are moments where you just wake up and it looks like everything's working. And then there [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3559.6s)]
*  are moments and this is what everybody needs to understand though, if some of these programs work, [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3563.28s)]
*  where it literally looks like the bottom is falling out and I cannot describe to people [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3568.6400000000003s)]
*  the pressure you will feel on behalf of you and your family when it looks like you're taking a [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3573.84s)]
*  30 or 40 or 50% negative downturn to your net worth. It inflicts a level of psychological damage [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3579.6000000000004s)]
*  that I cannot describe to you. And the bigger the numbers get, by the way, I told this story on [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3589.04s)]
*  Tucker, there was a period where I would wake up and I could just tweet and the markets would go [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3594.16s)]
*  up. They were like, what's he going to say next? And then it all stopped. And then there was a [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3598.08s)]
*  two and a half year period where I gave it all back and then some frustrating. The Midas touch [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3602.88s)]
*  goes away. It's beyond frustrating. It shakes you to your core. So if we do these programs, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3609.2799999999997s)]
*  I think the Friedberg idea is just beautiful. It's lovely. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3614.88s)]
*  What about you, Shultz? When did you make it? [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3618.56s)]
*  But just to finish, if we do it, we have to try to teach people how to deal with the drawdowns [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3620.2400000000002s)]
*  because that's where if you don't teach them how to deal with the vol, the volatility of losing money, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3626.32s)]
*  it's great when everything's green. But those red days, man, how you comport yourself, [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3632.8s)]
*  how you act, how you treat other people in the red days are the only days that matter. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3638.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's so experience. What about you, Shultz? When did you buy your first equity? [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3643.76s)]
*  I was probably. 35. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3646.88s)]
*  Oh, think about it. So, so my, my, I mean, my, how old are you? [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3651.36s)]
*  I'm 41. So I would maybe even a little bit later. Now I might've like owned stock without even [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3656.2400000000002s)]
*  realizing it type of thing where like I had like a business manager who set up some retirement fund [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3661.1200000000003s)]
*  or something like that, but not me actively choosing a stock and buying it. My, what my wife's [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3665.6800000000003s)]
*  father-in-law is a very successful businessman. And he's, he's, he's, I don't want to say like [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3672.88s)]
*  predicted the markets really well, but he has, I mean, he was in Nvidia like super early, early, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3679.76s)]
*  early, early and a bunch of others. And we were like sitting down and like Aspen somewhere. And [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3684.32s)]
*  he like said, Hey, listen, what do you mean? You don't own anything. He goes, Hey, can you take a, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3690.16s)]
*  you know, I don't know if we said 10 grand or a hundred grand or something like that. He goes, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3694.08s)]
*  can you just put it in these different stocks? I go, okay, sure. I open up this like E-Trade account [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3697.12s)]
*  or whatever the f**k it was. But an interesting thing right there is like you guys were so young [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3701.28s)]
*  was 18, 22, 14. And to me, I think like the education of this is really important. Like my [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3705.92s)]
*  parents did really well, but they're financially illiterate. Like there was no passing on this [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3713.2000000000003s)]
*  like knowledge of like investing when what it means to invest. Like they made their money by [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3718.2400000000002s)]
*  like working every single day for it. Not like you guys don't, but like they were teaching dance [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3723.1200000000003s)]
*  lessons. So I was like, this is how much the dance lesson costs and you pay me and maybe I'll have [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3726.5600000000004s)]
*  40 people in the class. Okay. More people are paying and now other teachers can also teach, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3730.88s)]
*  but it was intimidating to them. It was intimidating to me. It still is intimidating to me. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3735.36s)]
*  Well, this is the, I think the upside of crypto in some ways, also the upside of prize picks or, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3740.6400000000003s)]
*  you know, gambling poker. It's the upside of Robinhood and Coinbase and all these things [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3745.76s)]
*  being available. This generation, generation bet, like they love to gamble these young kids. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3750.6400000000003s)]
*  This is my concern. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3754.8s)]
*  No, but they're learning. They're learning how to take the, the downdrafts. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3756.4s)]
*  I think they are learning. I think they are learning. So maybe like the barrier to entry [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3760.08s)]
*  is less, but my concern is that they're treating it more like gambling than investing. And I think [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3763.52s)]
*  that we've almost like tricked the American public into thinking that investing is gambling. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3768.88s)]
*  That's when the way that you guys are describing is it's not, it's like investing in the S and P [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3774.08s)]
*  and then leaving it there and taking those downturns and waiting for it to come back up. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3778.48s)]
*  Yeah, but here's the thing. You have to learn these lessons at the poker table. You cannot play poker [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3782.64s)]
*  without real money or else you're not going to get the burn. You're not going to stay up at night. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3786.88s)]
*  So that's what these kids are doing there. How do we educate them? It's not every kid, right? [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3791.2000000000003s)]
*  The education comes from doing, and if you let these kids trade, they will figure it out over [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3795.12s)]
*  time. And then what happens is like you, they get married, they get a baby, they want to get a house. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3799.92s)]
*  And then they say, you know what? I'm going to, I'm going to stop buying meme coins. I'm going to [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3804.56s)]
*  start buying Bitcoin. I'm going to stop buying Bitcoin. I'm going to buy Nvidia and things. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3808.0s)]
*  That's not true. Jason, they just get addicted to gambling. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3811.44s)]
*  Exactly. I agree with you. I don't think that I think you're being super reductive, like, oh, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3814.48s)]
*  they'll get on the, the, all of a sudden understand Dave Swenson's Yale endowment asset allocation [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3819.52s)]
*  model. I've seen, they won't, I have seen thousands and thousands and thousands of guys over time who [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3825.52s)]
*  deeply steeped in this business wash out. Yeah. And each two a one, the more sophisticated they get, [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3833.28s)]
*  they all fall to the same pressures, which is they don't know how to simplify and they don't [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3841.36s)]
*  know how to be patient. These are things that every human being needs to learn. And I don't [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3846.96s)]
*  think time in the market actually solves those two traits. Those are psychological traits that you [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3852.6400000000003s)]
*  have to go and figure out in a different way. You look inside yourself and you have to figure [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3858.08s)]
*  those out. Okay. Yeah. Fair enough. But between the choice of, Hey, we're going to grow up blue [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3863.2000000000003s)]
*  collar. We have no access to these markets. We have no way to trade in them. We have no way to [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3868.16s)]
*  learn. And then today I think the system we have today is better. Can people go off the, you know, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3873.12s)]
*  jump the fence and lose all their money? Of course they can, but they could go to Vegas and do that. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3878.8799999999997s)]
*  Prior to that, they could work with a bookie. They could do football sheets. I think they're [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3883.3599999999997s)]
*  learning. And when you use some of these modern apps and you look at the strategies and you see [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3887.12s)]
*  people on Reddit working on these stocks and their thesis, I think it's trending in the right way. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3891.2799999999997s)]
*  They can always be more education, but this is, let's hope. I think the average American doesn't [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3895.92s)]
*  even know what compound interest is. I agree with you. In fact, I'll tell you a great story. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3902.7200000000003s)]
*  One of the best things that happened when I invested in the goals of state warriors, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3908.88s)]
*  I bought 10% of the team in 2011 or something. I got to meet all of them and I got to meet a [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3913.12s)]
*  lot of my heroes. And I remember one meeting where I sat with a goatee like player. Let's [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3918.8s)]
*  just put it that way. No, I don't want to say his name, but you, okay. Fair enough. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3926.0s)]
*  And he, he asked me the most incredible question. He's like, can you explain compound interest? [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3933.1200000000003s)]
*  And Schultz, I can tell you, I still have this spreadsheet. I just showed him a compound interest [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3940.88s)]
*  table and he had no idea how 8% versus 10% is like gargantuan over 50 years, over 20 years. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3947.2s)]
*  Yeah. And to your point, it was illuminating that you're right. Unless you, unless you go and you [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3957.3599999999997s)]
*  jump into it and you live it. And Jason, I agree with you. Like there's nothing like, look, Stan [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3963.68s)]
*  Druckenmiller says the same thing. Invest, then investigate. Like there's nothing like putting the [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3969.12s)]
*  risk on. Okay. There's nothing like playing a hand in poker. There's nothing like taking a shot [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3973.12s)]
*  at a different strategy in blackjack. Win or lose, you get feedback. But my point is most people [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3978.08s)]
*  don't get better. And so that's what you have to solve is like, how can you make it interesting, [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3983.7599999999998s)]
*  fun? How can you talk about the losses? Like this is a thing that I had immense trouble with. I [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3988.96s)]
*  still do today. I think I've gotten better with it is to be able to talk about the losses. How do [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3993.44s)]
*  you talk about getting whacked for $4 billion? So I can do it now, but it's brutal. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=3998.0s)]
*  It's stung for a while. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4002.8s)]
*  You're a better person since then. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4005.52s)]
*  You saw me go through it. How ashamed was I for the two years that I had to unwind that? [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4006.56s)]
*  It was hard for you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was hard. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4012.4s)]
*  I mean, you're imagining your whole identity is built into, you know, you being successful in [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4014.4s)]
*  these markets. And you measure it the wrong way. Like you point to the number in the bank account, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4019.04s)]
*  not the way your wife treats you, not the way your kids treat you, not the way your friends [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4023.2s)]
*  treat you. And then you're like, okay, well, I'm 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80% poor. So I'm just that much [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4026.96s)]
*  less of a human being. Yeah. But that's a good reality check to lean into family and those things [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4033.6s)]
*  that matter. So my point is like, if you can, if we can get people more into the market, I think [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4039.2s)]
*  it's an incredible thing, but you have to wrap it in these guardrails that have nothing to do with [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4043.28s)]
*  the market. Everything to do with who you are as a person. And I think like the first step is showing [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4048.08s)]
*  like, what is the most simplistic version of the benefit of the market? And I think it's compound [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4054.72s)]
*  interests. I really think that that is, if we start there, like remove the stock market, don't [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4060.72s)]
*  even talk about it. Just like, what happens if I left it in a savings account that's getting 4%? [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4065.12s)]
*  And I don't touch it right now. You know, the rule of 72, that was the one that opened my brain up. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4069.6s)]
*  So the rule of 72 is whatever the percentage you grow per month divided into 72. So let's say you [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4074.0s)]
*  were growing 7.2% in the market per year divide that it takes 10 years to double your money. So [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4081.36s)]
*  it's a time to double your money. Okay. If you were growing 7% a month, you know, on whatever your [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4087.6000000000004s)]
*  investments are, let's say you got a great business that's growing like Facebook or something like [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4093.84s)]
*  that. That means you double the number of users or revenue every 7.2 months. Once you understand [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4097.360000000001s)]
*  that, you can do it quickly. Just like in poker, you know, the number of outs, each card represents [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4102.08s)]
*  roughly 2% chance because it's 50 of them, right? So they each count for about 2%. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4106.24s)]
*  Then you can start doing this stuff in the back of your head. I had this idea. I think I talked [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4111.76s)]
*  about it here on the program of doing the kids investment club and I bought the domain kids [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4115.5199999999995s)]
*  investment club. I actually need to do this. I kind of prioritize this and find a CEO for it [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4118.8s)]
*  or do it as a nonprofit or something. Just kids need to learn this early. Robinhood or somebody [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4124.32s)]
*  should make an app where they can invest like a shadow, but it's, you know, like with their parents, [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4129.679999999999s)]
*  maybe they can make the trade. The parent approves it, something like that. There's something where [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4134.08s)]
*  we should be learning all this in high school. They should be like, what's more important than [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4138.24s)]
*  this? Remove the fear, remove the fear. And the reason it's important to what we were saying [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4142.48s)]
*  earlier, get the American people invested in American success and you will find so much more [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4147.5199999999995s)]
*  patriotism. You will not find us nitpicking on all these little things that a lot of us maybe go, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4153.2s)]
*  why is this such a big deal? Like the bathroom, like most of us are unaffected. I cannot begin [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4158.56s)]
*  to explain how quickly we'll forget about the bathrooms when the S and P is up 15% and you're [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4164.4800000000005s)]
*  looking at your portfolio and you're like, you could take a wherever you want. Okay. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4170.240000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. Yes. I have something else to focus on. Absolutely. Look at this. Hey, [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4175.280000000001s)]
*  Friedberg, here's your time machine. Check it out. There's your favorite show. I don't want to make [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4180.240000000001s)]
*  you more emotional, but there is your guy, Stanley Tucci from bull. I think it only made it one season [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4184.72s)]
*  right? One season, but Tucci gang in full effect. I was such a tech nerd growing up, but I never [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4191.280000000001s)]
*  thought about the business of technology. And then the startup boom happened and you got this bull [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4196.320000000001s)]
*  show on TV. And I'm like, man, this is so much more exciting than sitting in a fricking lab doing [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4200.8s)]
*  mathematical modeling where I was like pulling my fricking hair out. I'm like, I want to get after [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4205.04s)]
*  that. And the rest is history. You know, have you guys watched Stanley Tucci on HBO where he [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4209.12s)]
*  tours Italy and he does these little so great. And on Tick Tock, I've seen it and I've seen him cook [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4214.24s)]
*  on Tick Tock. He's like today, is it rolling? It's rolling today. I'm going to make you a fruit of [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4219.76s)]
*  the demand. It's a got there, but I'm doing it in the Capaccio a base and we're going to put, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4225.76s)]
*  and I'm like, I just, can this guy do ASMR or put me to bed at night? And this guy, he is, I'm going [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4231.599999999999s)]
*  to man crush on Tucci. I mean, he's, I would like to roll with Tucci. Can you imagine if we went to [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4238.48s)]
*  Italy and just had like a, just roll with Tucci through Italy? Oh, I love that guy. Any dream is [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4244.5599999999995s)]
*  possible. J. Cal you could pull it off where we're all dreaming here. We're all dreaming here. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4251.2s)]
*  All right. We're still dreamers by the way, really important. Everyone should know that. I think [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4255.759999999999s)]
*  like there's no, the thing that, the thing that a lot of people assume this is the true about humans [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4260.32s)]
*  in general is there's an end to the rainbow, but there isn't. You ride the rainbow till you die. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4265.36s)]
*  That's it. And there's always hope. There's always dreams. There's always more and it doesn't stop. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4269.839999999999s)]
*  So it makes it fun. Are you taking the ketamine in Austin or something? What happened? You just [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4275.36s)]
*  got all full of something. I'm a little hungover today. I started drinking at 10 AM yesterday. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4278.719999999999s)]
*  We went to, we went to the mothership last night. And we, well, we hung out with a couple of your [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4282.08s)]
*  boys, I think we hang out with Tony. Well, Tony, Tony was very nice. And, [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4288.08s)]
*  Shane Gillis was there. Shane Gillis was there, but he was big time. He was big time. There was [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4295.599999999999s)]
*  a mob around and we didn't get to meet him. The guy Burt who take, I didn't recognize. Yeah. He [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4299.759999999999s)]
*  had his shirt on. So I didn't recognize him. Yeah. I was like, but then I saw the body shape and I [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4305.2s)]
*  was like, yeah, that's, that's probably, probably him. When did you start in comedy? I was, I think [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4310.24s)]
*  it's almost been like 18 years or something like that. She started in your early twenties in New [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4315.759999999999s)]
*  York going to the funny bone or what? I have a question. How'd you get into it? How do you keep [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4320.0s)]
*  your, like, how do you pay for your life before you make it? Like what, like, is it that you have [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4324.56s)]
*  a normal day job? I lived, I lived with my parents for like a very long time. Like my parents lived [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4330.160000000001s)]
*  in these village. So I was walking distance from like multiple comedy clubs. It was, you know, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4335.52s)]
*  incredibly, uh, I mean, I worked like with my parents for a little bit. Then I managed restaurants [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4339.52s)]
*  and I like just managed them. You managed restaurants in Manhattan? Yeah, I did. I started [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4344.96s)]
*  in Santa Barbara when I was going to college. That's where I did my first comedy gig. And then [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4348.320000000001s)]
*  I managed a restaurant out in Brooklyn and, um, not really, not very good. Which one would I know [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4352.56s)]
*  it? It was called biscuit barbecue. It was in Park Slope, Brooklyn. And then, um, and then I [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4357.04s)]
*  started to make a little money in standup. It was like enough to like buy a moon's falafel. I like [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4362.160000000001s)]
*  had like a five to ten. You had falafel money. I had, I had a five to $10 a day budget and like, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4366.8s)]
*  like I could eat cereal for breakfast. And then I just, and I saved some money because I was going [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4372.160000000001s)]
*  to school. Well, when I was going to school, I was working at that restaurant and I like saved some [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4376.96s)]
*  money. And like, I had a little pipe dream of opening up a bar with a friend of mine in New York. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4381.04s)]
*  And then I was like, you know what, I'm just going to spend this money trying to be a comedian. And [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4385.12s)]
*  I hope by the time I get rid of the money, I'm making money at comedy. And it came down to like [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4389.28s)]
*  $700. My bank account, I was like renting out the room where I slept in and I would sleep in a closet [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4395.04s)]
*  in my apartment. And, uh, it just, and it worked out, it just worked out. I started making a couple [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4400.08s)]
*  of money, do a couple of gigs, start touring, got on a TV show and then it kind of worked out. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4405.68s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Was there a moment that where, [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4410.96s)]
*  because when you, when, you know, when the cancel culture was alive and well, that's when I first [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4413.4400000000005s)]
*  encountered you, it was initially on TikTok actually. And you were on fire because you were [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4417.52s)]
*  saying stuff nobody else was saying. And I thought, how does he even dare to pull this off? And [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4422.64s)]
*  was there, was there a moment that where you broke or you tipped or no? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4428.16s)]
*  So you kind of like, it's interesting, you kind of break and then you go away. Like, so I, [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4431.12s)]
*  so I broke on like some MTV shows and I was, you know, doing all these things on MTV, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4435.36s)]
*  had my own shows and all that kind of stuff. And then I kind of, you know, the MTV thing kind of [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4439.76s)]
*  dried up and then I kind of went away. But I was luckily doing this podcast with Charlemagne and [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4444.24s)]
*  the podcast was very popular and that was like providing for me. And then I was doing some [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4447.84s)]
*  shows on the road and you know, people would come out from the podcast. But, um, and then I really [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4452.32s)]
*  couldn't get any traction in standup world. So when I was doing like comedy stuff with MTV, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4457.76s)]
*  it wasn't really in the stamp world in this, cause my standup maybe wasn't of the ilk of what was [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4462.56s)]
*  like popular at the time. And I have a lot of empathy, by the way, for like the people who are [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4467.360000000001s)]
*  just working at a network, they're producing these shows, like they, they're kids in private school. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4472.320000000001s)]
*  I want to tell a crazy joke about women or gays or whatever it is. And they're like, I'm not trying [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4476.96s)]
*  to get fired. And like, I'm just trying, my kids in private school, we just got them into Dalton. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4482.96s)]
*  I don't want to rock the boat. Like, you know, it's reasonable. You understand, like, I don't [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4486.96s)]
*  think that they're self preservation. Exactly. So, but I didn't want to change my comedy. So I was [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4491.44s)]
*  like, okay, where can I put it out? And luckily we were putting the podcast out on YouTube and [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4496.56s)]
*  it was successful. And I just started putting things out on YouTube and I started doing these [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4502.08s)]
*  shows and these shows start selling out. It was like really weird. Like the first thing I put out, [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4507.28s)]
*  I sold out the next weekend and I was never going to sell that. How many seats were like 300 seat [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4511.36s)]
*  clubs and you do maybe four or five shows a weekend and you get 50 bucks a seat, 20 bucks [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4516.08s)]
*  a seat. No, not even you get a flat rate. You get two grand to do the weekend or something like that. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4520.5599999999995s)]
*  And a lot of these times the comedy clubs would just like call people and say, Hey, do you want [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4524.8s)]
*  to see this guy and give away the tickets for free? It was really the old model was basically, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4528.72s)]
*  it's like a bar. So you just get the people in and they sell the drinks. So the weekend would sell [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4532.5599999999995s)]
*  out and another one would sell out. And I was like, Holy s**t, maybe, maybe there's something. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4536.96s)]
*  There's a conversion rate that I didn't see. And I kept putting stuff out on YouTube. I would do a [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4540.64s)]
*  new clip every week for a year on YouTube. And then I put these a special on YouTube instead. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4545.04s)]
*  And then I learned very quickly that there was this huge like white space in the market. Like the [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4550.0s)]
*  comedy on TV was corny and people didn't really like it. And nobody was putting out like the [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4554.48s)]
*  quote unquote, like real comedy. There's different versions of comedy, but I'm being very simplistic. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4559.92s)]
*  And the more edgy stuff I put out on YouTube and it just exploded. And yeah, my career kind of really [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4565.12s)]
*  took off from there. And then COVID came around and there was a, I was able to be a little bit more [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4571.36s)]
*  honest because I wasn't tied to a network and worried about maybe losing my job at the network. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4578.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then it just, I think in America, we reward bravery. Yeah. You just signed a Netflix [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4584.5599999999995s)]
*  deal, right? I mean, you did this show. Yeah. We're actually doing the show in Austin tonight, [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4590.24s)]
*  where we're going to talk with some folks about this general concept where you start out as kind [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4595.36s)]
*  of an independent, say whatever you want. You're totally free. It's your own platform. It's your own [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4598.96s)]
*  voice. And then you go sign a deal with another platform. Like, are you now, do you find it hard [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4603.6s)]
*  to trade the money for whatever might come along with that? There's restrictions. There's two ways [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4609.44s)]
*  to look at it, right? It's like, there's one, I think that I don't want to give myself too much [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4615.2s)]
*  credit here, but I think that what we did is created another marketplace for comedy that [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4620.56s)]
*  the streaming networks had to now compete with. Yeah. So they were losing comics to YouTube [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4625.28s)]
*  because it was more advantageous to put your comedy up on YouTube and build a following and [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4631.12s)]
*  then go sell tickets on the road. Whereas before the only way you could really make a big chunk [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4635.36s)]
*  of money on your comedy is if you've got one of these fancy specials. Now people are like, [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4639.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't even want to do the special because if I put it on YouTube, I can tour for years and really [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4643.2s)]
*  build a fan base. So I have this autonomy. The Netflix thing is interesting because Netflix is [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4647.28s)]
*  the second biggest, I guess, streaming service on the planet. It's like YouTube and Netflix. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4652.24s)]
*  So if I already have this huge imprint on YouTube, it would only be smart for me to now tap into the [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4657.5199999999995s)]
*  second biggest and see if there's some people there that aren't consuming my content on YouTube. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4663.84s)]
*  So back to the, so then back to the guy who's got the kid at Dalton now, when you go and negotiate [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4667.12s)]
*  a deal with Netflix, are they basically silent or do they have- [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4672.88s)]
*  Not a single note. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4676.8s)]
*  Yeah. So you do whatever you want and it is what it is, let it rip. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4677.92s)]
*  Now my last special was supposed to be with Amazon. So it was with Amazon and they had some notes [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4681.2s)]
*  and I bought it back from them and I put it out myself. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4686.4s)]
*  Wow, really? Wow. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4688.16s)]
*  Yeah. And I sold it myself and it was actually one of the coolest things ever because [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4689.599999999999s)]
*  I think I'm maybe one of the only comics that actually knows what they're worth. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4694.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4698.08s)]
*  You don't really know what your- [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4698.72s)]
*  Well, walk us through that. So you do it and what do the notes say that you're like- [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4700.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it was two jokes and I get it. They make money selling toilet paper. Why are they going [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4705.28s)]
*  to have this huge, you know, kerfuffle- [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4709.12s)]
*  You made fun of the toilet paper industry. I got it. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4712.64s)]
*  Yeah. Big toilet paper, big TP, very powerful lobby. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4714.72s)]
*  You know what's funny is like culture has changed and I feel like a lot of times the streamers are [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4718.88s)]
*  like downriver from culture. So like, I bet now I would be able to put it out on Amazon and be [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4722.64s)]
*  totally fine. But at that time it was maybe very edgy and a volatile time culturally. So [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4726.8s)]
*  I was able to put it out and, you know- [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4732.4s)]
*  But you had the choice, right? You could have taken the jokes out and kept it, [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4734.64s)]
*  but then instead you took the harder path, which is I'm just going to buy it back. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4737.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4741.28s)]
*  And I take the risk and I'll figure it out later. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4741.84s)]
*  Yeah. I'm not risk averse at all. I actually enjoy risk. It kind of excites me. But what [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4743.84s)]
*  excites me more is like putting out the piece exactly how I want to put it out. And I can't [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4750.32s)]
*  like scream about censorship and comedians should do the jokes we want to do. And then the second [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4754.08s)]
*  somebody gives me a big check, I go, whoa, we don't have to do the joke. Like I have to be at [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4758.72s)]
*  least consistent on that. And culture continued to change and you got to give Netflix credit too. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4762.96s)]
*  They took a lot of hits for putting out comedy that some people thought was maybe a little bit [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4770.4800000000005s)]
*  too offensive. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4774.32s)]
*  I mean, the Chappelle stuff. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4774.64s)]
*  The Chappelle stuff is really- [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4776.0s)]
*  Got put them in the crosshairs. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4777.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4778.96s)]
*  They stood strong, right? [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4779.36s)]
*  Absolutely. They stood strong. And like seeing that gave me a lot of confidence. So I was like, [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4780.96s)]
*  okay. And they did literally, we just made the whole thing and they just gave us money. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4784.88s)]
*  So like they were not involved at all in like the creation, so to say, they they were involved in [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4790.08s)]
*  giving us money for it. And then they're involved in the marketing, obviously, and their algorithm [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4796.16s)]
*  and getting it. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4801.36s)]
*  That's all Sarandos. He's he believes in comedy. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4801.76s)]
*  Yeah, but he's a huge comedy fan from back in the day. I think people don't realize that about him. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4804.4s)]
*  Like you need somebody who actually loves the art and is not just looking at it as a thing that they [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4808.5599999999995s)]
*  can monetize. Like there's a term this guy used that you have to find somebody spiritually aligned [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4813.84s)]
*  with you. And that's not mumbo jumbo. It like they truly understand the intention of comedy. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4818.96s)]
*  So things aren't as hurtful or painful to them because they understand what you intend to do. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4823.92s)]
*  So, and then I got- [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4828.8s)]
*  Interesting too. They tried to cancel you. What was the joke? [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4830.24s)]
*  Who? [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4833.44s)]
*  The mobs. Cause they went after Tony Hinchcliffe twice. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4833.92s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4837.68s)]
*  And each time he went 10X, they came after Chamath on this program. That was the first level up. We [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4838.16s)]
*  got three times the audience after they tried to cancel Chamath. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4842.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4845.28s)]
*  The White House released a statement. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4845.84s)]
*  It doesn't really work when you have like core fans that believe in you. And I feel like you guys [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4847.44s)]
*  have probably built that, you know, the relationships you've built with your fans. There's probably [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4852.48s)]
*  people very grateful of the information that you give them. And so when they try to paint you in a [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4856.0s)]
*  certain light, you actually have like a hundred hours of time with those people. They know you [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4861.919999999999s)]
*  to be more than that one statement that you've said. So now they're not as concerned about that [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4867.5199999999995s)]
*  thing you said that maybe is taken out of context or people have been offended by. I think that the [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4872.16s)]
*  biggest thing that people miss about comedians is like, you're allowed to be offended by the joke [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4876.32s)]
*  that I say. Like you're allowed to react however the fuck you want to react about it. You had your [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4882.16s)]
*  life, you went through some crazy shit. Maybe you were bullied as a kid and like you don't want other [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4886.24s)]
*  people to potentially have those feelings. So you see a joke that could elicit that and you're like, [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4892.0s)]
*  I want to protect them from that. That's kind of noble. I'm like, I'm cool with that. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4895.84s)]
*  If you yourself tell me you don't like me teasing you, I'm not going to tease you personally ever [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4900.719999999999s)]
*  again. I want you to feel good, but it doesn't mean that I won't continue to make those jokes [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4905.44s)]
*  somewhere else. And I think my shows, like I got the most diverse audience in comedy history. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4909.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. So it's like you come out to one of my shows, you can't tell me that people don't [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4914.16s)]
*  like these jokes. And I try very hard to like, like if I'm curious about your culture, you'll [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4919.679999999999s)]
*  know it through the jokes. It's not some little bullshit. Like I'll try to dive deep and even [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4925.44s)]
*  surprise you about something that I might know. And I think in that way, people start to feel [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4930.4s)]
*  seen and they don't feel bullied. They actually feel like represented and they're like excited [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4935.04s)]
*  about it. Look, you said something at the beginning, which I thought was really interesting, [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4939.84s)]
*  which is you're like a, you have to great comedians are great observers of culture. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4943.28s)]
*  So can you, can you just tell us like, just observe the cultural moment? What we talked a [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4948.0s)]
*  lot about it, but I just want you to be maybe like, put a point on it. Where are we? Where's [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4952.24s)]
*  America? What the hell is going on? Like what's happened? What's happening? Like however you feel [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4956.48s)]
*  that question, like what the hell is going on? All time, low confidence in institutions, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4960.56s)]
*  low confidence in information. There's an obsession with conspiracy because there's, [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4969.84s)]
*  I mean, that's twofold. One, like it's the easiest way for dumb people to feel smart. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4976.88s)]
*  Like when you know something no one else knows and you get to share with people, [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4980.64s)]
*  like there's that like dopamine hit where like, I bet you didn't know this happened, you know? [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4983.280000000001s)]
*  But those thrive in times where there's not real transparency. So I think everybody's looking for [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4987.68s)]
*  answers and nothing is exactly how it seems. And the only way to re-instill that confidence is I [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4993.92s)]
*  think like brutal transparency. Like you got to just be like really honest with the people. This [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=4998.72s)]
*  is what it is. And we're Americans, we're proud people, you know, so we can get through whatever [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5003.68s)]
*  you say, but you got to tell it to us as it is. And I think we're just assessing relationships [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5008.08s)]
*  right now. And I think like when the economy is rough, like you're seeing all the Jewish stuff [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5013.52s)]
*  right now, right? Like obviously it's a conflict. Well, this is the thing you got to understand. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5017.92s)]
*  Like most people have never met a Jewish person. Like most Americans have no clue what a Jewish [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5022.88s)]
*  person is outside of Kirby or Seinfeld. They don't know what it is. They think Jews are [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5027.6s)]
*  Upper East Side New Yorkers. Like Seinfeld or they think it's like Hasidim. Like it's just like one [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5032.96s)]
*  or the other. Exactly. They don't even know what like a Sephardic, they don't know what an African [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5040.08s)]
*  Jew is or Moroccan Jew. They have no clue what that is. And they shouldn't. They're like, how many [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5043.6s)]
*  Jews are there? They're like more people from Laos than there are Jews, right? Like it's like a very [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5049.2s)]
*  small population. So I think there's like a little bit of a disconnect. And, you know, when you don't [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5052.96s)]
*  know people, and I think this is probably true, and I could be off, but I think there's like an [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5060.48s)]
*  ambient feeling towards Jews from people who don't know Jews. It's an ambient light. And [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5065.04s)]
*  the stereotypes are probably not like the best. They're not exactly negative as long as the [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5071.92s)]
*  economy is good, right? They're like, oh, they, they're successful. They kind of stick together. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5077.52s)]
*  They own businesses. They whatever. And as long as the economy is good, everybody's cool. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5082.32s)]
*  And then eggs get expensive and you're buying on your rent and you don't feel hope. And you know, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5087.12s)]
*  and then you start going, why do they got all that? What the what are they about? Why are they, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5092.0s)]
*  why are they separatists? You know, like, I'm here proselytizing, I'm trying to get everybody [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5097.68s)]
*  to go to heaven and they just got their own thing with, and it's very easy for them to become this [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5101.6s)]
*  like other group. And then you extrapolate that with what's happening, like Palestine and Israel. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5106.24s)]
*  And you get people to start like assessing like the relationship between America and another [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5113.2s)]
*  country. Like you saw America become very uninterested in Ukraine quickly. Like we, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5117.44s)]
*  the second economy goes down, we start going, well, what do they do for us? What, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5125.759999999999s)]
*  why are we giving them like, and they're starting to ask similar questions about Israel. And [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5129.679999999999s)]
*  there's a lot of anti-Semites that are jumping on it and they're muddying the whole thing. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5137.28s)]
*  They're going, ah, this is what the day control the government. They do this all the every [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5140.5599999999995s)]
*  conspiracy. We told you so. By the way, you're, you're speaking a profound secret that many [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5144.24s)]
*  administrations in government have known for a long time. And I think this is where some of the [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5151.76s)]
*  mistrust comes from. I talked about this, like maybe it was like a couple months ago, but [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5156.08s)]
*  the most incredible stock market was actually under Biden. The most amount of money printed [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5160.96s)]
*  was under Biden. The most cumulative total budget deficits was under Biden. The most amount of [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5166.0s)]
*  short-term refinancing of debt was under Biden. And part of what you can explain is that if you [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5172.64s)]
*  keep the signals that everything is healthy or up, you're allowed to propagate all of these other [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5178.8s)]
*  things that would get very quickly recapitulated. And when you take the gas out of the market and [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5185.360000000001s)]
*  you take the gas out of all these other markets and all of a sudden the price of energy is up and [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5192.08s)]
*  the price of this is up and the price of that is up, then you start to question, hold on a second, [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5196.160000000001s)]
*  why are all of these things as important, you know, the above the line, below the line conversation [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5199.84s)]
*  that we have tried to have several times on this pot, Jason. Yeah. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5205.4400000000005s)]
*  You have to meet people where they feel in order to communicate with them, right? Like they could, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5210.88s)]
*  like when people right now are like assessing like America's relationship with Israel, like it's, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5215.280000000001s)]
*  it's, and they, you hear these like soundbites, like that's our closest ally. And then they go, [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5219.360000000001s)]
*  what does that mean? It's like, well, let's explain to them what that means. Like, let's explain the [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5223.6s)]
*  importance of that relationship and how it's beneficial to Americans. Because if you don't [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5227.36s)]
*  explain it and you just go, oh, just be quiet, whatever, then they start to look at these [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5231.44s)]
*  lunatics on Twitter and start to go, wait a minute, is that, is that true? [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5236.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And then they're down the conspiracy hall. Like you have to explain, like I don't know what [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5240.24s)]
*  the mineral deal was about, but I know for, with, with Ukraine, but I know for a second, [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5245.599999999999s)]
*  there was some Americans who go, oh, we're going to get some minerals out of that. All right, [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5250.0s)]
*  minerals sound good. Like it's going to pass back. It's that, it's that simplistic, right? [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5252.719999999999s)]
*  So it's like, I think, I think that kind of communication is important and it will actually [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5257.2s)]
*  help understand these relationships, which I imagine are very important. I'm not privy to all [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5262.96s)]
*  the geopolitical decisions that are going on there. Who knows intelligence from Israel could [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5268.4s)]
*  afforded 20 more nine 11s. Yeah. Maybe you can't say that because you expose the intelligence [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5272.5599999999995s)]
*  operatives you have in the field, but it would, I think be helpful to understand the value of that [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5277.2s)]
*  for the everyday American. So this is where you see something crazy on Twitter. You can go, [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5282.72s)]
*  okay, you're just an anti-Semite and you're looking for a justification for your hate. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5287.2s)]
*  I mean, this is your point about Trump. Sometimes he has these take care of it. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5291.84s)]
*  We'll see you later, bro. Take care of it. This is like, I think the point is going to be [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5295.28s)]
*  a conspiracy theory about that right now. I just want to let you know. You just talked about [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5299.2s)]
*  Israel and he's like, yeah, I'm the one Jewish guy left. I'm ready to go. Way to go. Sheltzy. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5303.12s)]
*  You are. This is how it starts, David. David, this is how it starts. You drove them out. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5307.2s)]
*  Thanks a lot. You drove them out. Right. Sheltzy, when you said, you know, [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5312.4s)]
*  Trump's a masterful kind of communicator here. Biden gave all these weapons to, to Ukraine under [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5315.28s)]
*  the auspices of what's called a loan lease. They have to pay them back, but Biden never [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5322.639999999999s)]
*  communicated that well. Tell us. And then Trump comes out and he said, you know what? We gave [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5327.12s)]
*  them 180 million, 180 billion. They're going to give us 500 billion back. We're making a 40. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5331.84s)]
*  He basically described a 42% compounded return. Sounds good to me. Yeah. Better than anything [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5336.639999999999s)]
*  that's ever happened. I mean, he is out there in terms of his ability to communicate it. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5342.88s)]
*  Chamath, as we wrap here, any final thoughts? What do you think about Trump and what he's, [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5347.36s)]
*  how he's doing and what he's doing so far? And what do you think about Elon and Doge? [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5353.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay. So, uh, Trump and what he's doing, how he's doing so far, like I, I don't know, like, [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5359.12s)]
*  in other words, like, I don't, I don't know if I can like assess it right away. Maybe I'm giving [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5365.04s)]
*  him a little bit longer, uh, like landing strip or whatever than other people. Cause I have a [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5369.36s)]
*  little bit more hope or optimism. Again, if you don't like the guy, you're going to see how [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5374.32s)]
*  horrible this is immediately, but I'm going to give them a little bit more leeway to see if it [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5377.92s)]
*  doesn't work out and it's really horrible. I'll be the first person to call it out. Like I, [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5382.32s)]
*  I've, he's empowered. We should definitely check the people in power, but I'm hoping that these [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5386.639999999999s)]
*  actions in the short term are beneficial in the long term. Is everyone going to work out? No. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5392.0s)]
*  Um, Doge is like, I'm so depressed about not depressed and stupid, but like I'm bummed about [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5396.88s)]
*  because I don't think there's any American that is pro waste inefficiency and bloat. This should be a [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5401.92s)]
*  bipartisan issue. Like all Americans should be coming together going, Oh my God, the DMV is [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5409.2s)]
*  going to get better. This sounds awesome. And I think, you know, I have a lot of respect for Elon, [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5414.5599999999995s)]
*  but I think sometimes on Twitter, he's like twisting the knife a little bit. And it's like, [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5420.88s)]
*  you don't need to twist the knife. Like we all want this. This is something we can come together [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5426.24s)]
*  as a country and support. This sounds great. Don't twist it. Just kind of let it be, show your wins. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5432.32s)]
*  When you do something wrong, we can acknowledge the things that we did are wrong and we'll respect [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5440.24s)]
*  that. It bums me that this has become so partisan. And I do understand there are a lot of people on [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5444.400000000001s)]
*  the left that are making this partisan as well. And they're weaponizing. There was this crazy [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5449.2s)]
*  clip between Rogan and Elon where Rogan was like, how does all this go down actually? And he's like, [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5454.4s)]
*  well, I can't really speak about the corruption because I'm afraid it would get me assassinated. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5460.24s)]
*  He's like, actually, if I tell you what I know, it was the weirdest like two minute clip. And then [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5464.08s)]
*  they just kind of left it and moved on. And my brain was like, what are they talking about? What, [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5469.5199999999995s)]
*  what must be going on? I mean, there's a lot of money going out the door. Yeah. But who's [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5474.32s)]
*  killing Elon? Like if we are going to have World War III, don't you want the guy that has the [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5478.96s)]
*  rockets to go to Mars on your side? Yeah. You kind of want the super genius on your side. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5483.44s)]
*  For sure. Another thing that's like really interesting to me is like people keep going, [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5488.64s)]
*  people keep doing this things like, what is Elon's play? Like, what is he doing here? Like, [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5493.28s)]
*  is he actually going to take over? And it's like, Elon has been dealing with like local government [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5497.52s)]
*  for so long, trying to push through. Like he is not an American citizen. He cannot be present. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5502.0s)]
*  He is at the highest position he will ever be in his lifetime in America. You can't get higher [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5507.52s)]
*  than being the right hand man of the president. Since you're not from America, you can never be [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5512.88s)]
*  present. So I think he's going to behave really well, because now he's in the most powerful [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5516.8s)]
*  position he will ever be in. If you want to talk about like power plays, you got to watch out for [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5522.88s)]
*  JD. That guy's that guy's high emotional intelligence like that. That's somebody that I would be keeping [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5528.96s)]
*  my eyes on if I'm Trump. But Elon, he's going to be a good, he's going to be your best friend [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5536.32s)]
*  because it's only downhill if he pisses Trump off. Interesting, interesting little man, [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5541.04s)]
*  Turing candidate for JD. No, no, no, I'm not saying that he's going to do anything bad, [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5546.719999999999s)]
*  but he is like, don't treat him lightly. We got this. Don't sleep on JD. New Yorkers, [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5550.88s)]
*  we do this all the time. We hear some with like a Southern accent. We think they're a goofball. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5557.04s)]
*  And it's like, that guy went from like a broken home to Yale, Appalachia to Yale. And then the [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5560.32s)]
*  VP and like 40. He's your age. He's like 40. He called Trump Hitler or something. And he ended [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5565.76s)]
*  up as he said, I'm a never Trump guy. He's so to say that he's not emotionally intelligent. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5571.52s)]
*  Does he say he doesn't know how to manage or whatever that term is? He's sappy. I keep an [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5577.280000000001s)]
*  eye on him. Keeping an eye on him for sure. All right, listen, Andrew Schultz is playing at the [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5582.72s)]
*  funny bone on April 16th and 17th. He'll be at chuckles on the 20th drink minimum by the VL. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5587.04s)]
*  You know where to find them incredible, incredible Netflix special. Who do you think? Who do you [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5595.76s)]
*  bait? Last question. Who do you think is the funniest? If you had to just take a wild stab at [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5601.2s)]
*  who the funniest person? No, me, me, Jason or free. Oh, between the three of you. Okay, so [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5605.76s)]
*  you can say me. Jason. So Jason is the most like naturally inclined to be funny. He's probably [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5614.320000000001s)]
*  just the most funny being around. Chomoth will probably get the biggest laughs when he says [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5619.84s)]
*  something funny because he's like, he's not asking for much. Like he'll just say something [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5624.64s)]
*  that's like a dart and it will kind of like hit you and you'll be like, Oh, and then I think David [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5629.76s)]
*  will like structure something really funny. And you're like, Oh, that was a clever I see how you [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5635.12s)]
*  did that right there. I was actually when I was an astrophysicist, Chelsea, I am so that would be my [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjU-Nd6iiQ4&t=5640.08s)]
