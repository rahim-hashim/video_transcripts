# In conversation with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
**All In Podcast:** [May 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g)
*  Saks, you ready? You got your quick time going? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=0.0s)]
*  Oh, let me do that real quick. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2.4s)]
*  And just a quick note, Saks, Mr. Kennedy doesn't have earpieces in, so we just have to be careful [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4.72s)]
*  of the crosstalk. We're talking over each other. I'll direct questions to each person [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=10.08s)]
*  and then follow-ups. You can obviously just use your judgment and went to insert yourself, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=13.92s)]
*  but be gentle on the insertion there because we don't want... That came out wrong. Just [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=17.68s)]
*  be gentle when you interrupt. There's your cold open. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=22.12s)]
*  At least if you did it incorrectly, it'll be quick. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=27.56s)]
*  Okay. Here we go. In three, two... [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=30.04s)]
*  All right, everybody. Welcome to the All In Podcast. As many of you know, this podcast has [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=49.32s)]
*  gotten quite popular the last two years, typically in the top 10 or 20 each week. And we talk about [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=54.04s)]
*  politics. We've got a big following in DC. Why are you calling me self-absorbed, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=59.0s)]
*  Chabot? Let me listen to how your co-host opens his show. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=64.84s)]
*  Calm down, everybody. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=67.48s)]
*  It's okay. Yeah. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=68.12s)]
*  And as part of that, our ongoing discussions about politics and presidential candidates has [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=69.24s)]
*  resonated in particular communities. And today we are lucky enough to have one of the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  top presidential hopefuls in the 2024 election joining us, Robert Kennedy Jr. And we will be [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=82.36s)]
*  inviting all presidential candidates to come on to the All In Podcast and have candid discussions [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=89.88s)]
*  that are unfiltered the way the audience would expect them. We're going to play with different [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  formats, but we decided for this first one, we've got a series of topics we'd like to cover, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=101.16s)]
*  and we're going to treat it like any other All In Podcast. With that, I'll have David Sachs, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  who is the most conservative of our panel, who has been also the most enthusiastic, I think, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=113.16s)]
*  of everybody here and one of the most enthusiastic supporters of Robert Kennedy Jr.'s pursuit of the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  presidency of the United States. So with that, David, would you like to introduce our guest? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=126.52s)]
*  Yeah. Let me give Bobby a proper introduction here. So Robert Francis Kennedy Jr. is [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=129.96s)]
*  entering the political arena as a candidate for the first time at the age of 69, but it's perhaps [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=135.48s)]
*  no exaggeration to say that he was destined for the mission he is now pursuing. He is the nephew [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  of President John F. Kennedy and the son of Attorney General and Senator Robert F. Kennedy. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=144.76s)]
*  When Bobby was 14, his dad was running for president on a platform of civil rights, civil [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  liberties, lifting Americans out of poverty and opposing the Vietnam War. He had just won the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  California primary when he was tragically assassinated. R.F.K. Jr. graduated from Harvard [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=157.64s)]
*  and the University of Virginia Law School and became an environmental lawyer who aggressively [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=162.2s)]
*  litigated against corporate polluters and government agencies that were failing to regulate them. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  He has always put the health and safety of the American people at the forefront of his activism, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=171.48s)]
*  and this has made him controversial at times as he has questioned the safety of some pharmaceutical [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=175.32s)]
*  products and also criticized COVID restrictions during the pandemic. For this, the mainstream [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=179.39999999999998s)]
*  media has tried to paint him as a, quote, conspiracy theorist. But given that so many [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=185.0s)]
*  conspiracy theories about COVID have been vindicated, Tablet Magazine wrote, quote, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=188.92s)]
*  at this point the fact that Robert F. Kennedy is the country's leading conspiracy theorist [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=193.64s)]
*  alone qualifies him to be president. But the biggest reason why I think his candidacy is so [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=197.72s)]
*  interesting and relevant is that it hearkens back to a democratic party that believed in peace instead [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=202.76s)]
*  of war, free speech and civil liberties instead of censorship, building up the middle class instead [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=207.64s)]
*  of the donor class, and opposing corporate greed, especially in the military industrial complex, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=212.11999999999998s)]
*  which is a message you just don't hear much anymore coming from the democratic side of the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=217.0s)]
*  aisle. So with that, Bobby Kennedy, welcome to the program. Thank you so much for having me. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=221.24s)]
*  So maybe we could start with foreign policy, something we've discussed here, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=226.52s)]
*  specifically the Ukraine and Russia's invasion of Ukraine and our support of that war. Sax, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=230.84s)]
*  would you like to tee up a question for Mr. Kennedy? I think Bobby's tweets on the subject [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=237.4s)]
*  show that he has a really deep understanding of it. He's been saying a lot of things that I've [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=242.44s)]
*  been saying since the beginning of the war, which it not just the fact that we're risking [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=247.24s)]
*  World War Three over, you know, getting involved in a country that isn't a treaty ally of the United [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=253.48s)]
*  States, has never been a vital interest in the United States, but I think your critique goes [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=260.52s)]
*  deeper because you actually understand the causes of how this war started. So maybe, you know, Bobby, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=263.72s)]
*  you could speak to that. How did we end up in this proxy war with Russia from your standpoint? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=269.96s)]
*  Well, you know, first of all, let me start by saying this. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=278.52s)]
*  I supported the humanitarian aid to the Ukraine, which is what we were told initially was the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=285.96s)]
*  mission. Although I was suspicious of it. And my son, as I've mentioned, actually went over, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=293.24s)]
*  left law school, did not tell us where he was going and went over and joined the Foreign Legion [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=302.92s)]
*  and fought in the Kharkiv offensive with a special forces group. He was served as a machine gunner. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=309.16s)]
*  He was in engagements with the Russians. And but he feels the same way, essentially, that I did, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=316.84s)]
*  that this is no longer a humanitarian mission and all the decisions the United States have made [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  has made since the start has been about have been about prolonging the war, about maximizing the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=330.67999999999995s)]
*  violence of the war and being absolutely intransigent against the many opportunities [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=340.2s)]
*  to actually settle the war. And that my understanding of the war is that not that Zelensky [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  is pushing this war as hard as he can, but that the neocons in the White House want this war. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=356.03999999999996s)]
*  They want it regime change with the Russians. They want to exhaust the Russian armies. This [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=363.48s)]
*  what Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in 2022, our objective is to exhaust and degrade Russian [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=368.04s)]
*  forces so they cannot fight anywhere else in the world. And President Biden acknowledged that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=375.40000000000003s)]
*  one of his objectives in the war is regime change in Russia, removing Vladimir Putin. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=381.88s)]
*  Well, if those are the objectives, that is the opposite of a humanitarian mission. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=387.08000000000004s)]
*  That is a mission to maximize casualties, to prolong the war. It's essentially a war of [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=392.12s)]
*  attrition. And that's what we're seeing. And the brunt of this is being paid by the flower of [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=397.64000000000004s)]
*  Ukrainian youth. There have been over 300,000. This is something that the US government and the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=403.64000000000004s)]
*  Ukrainian government have worked hard to hide the number of casualties, which has been catastrophic. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=409.56s)]
*  This is the most violent conflict since World War Two that's taken place probably anywhere in the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=415.24s)]
*  world. And the casualties are enormous. Over 300,000 Ukrainian dead. The Russians are killing [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=420.04s)]
*  Ukrainian, depending on who you believe, at a ratio of five to one to eight to one, which is the seven [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=427.8s)]
*  to one in the recently leaked, whistleblower leaked Pentagon documents. And the Russians cannot [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=436.28000000000003s)]
*  lose this war. We're being told they're losing. They cannot afford to lose this war. This is [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=445.48s)]
*  existential for them. And they have been building up their forces. They have a 10 to one artillery [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=450.6s)]
*  advantage on us. And this is an artillery war. It's simply, and we do not have the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=457.24s)]
*  artillery to replace what we've lost up there. This is a war that is proceeding in a very [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=463.0s)]
*  cataclysmic trajectory. And the answer to your question about how we got in this war [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=470.2s)]
*  goes back a long way. But I would say that the real story starts in 2014, when the US government, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=479.64s)]
*  and particularly the neocons in the White House and elsewhere, participated and supported the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=487.88s)]
*  overthrow, violent overthrow, a coup d'etat against the democratically elected government of the [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=495.16s)]
*  Ukraine and put in a very, very anti-Russian government. This prompted the Russians who then [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=501.8s)]
*  believed that the US Navy was now going to be invited into the Black Sea to have a port at [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=509.40000000000003s)]
*  Crimea. It prompted the Russians to preemptedly invade Crimea. At the same time, the government [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=517.64s)]
*  that came into the Ukraine began enacting a series of laws that turned the Russian populations of the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=528.4399999999999s)]
*  Dombass region into second class citizens. They illegalized essentially their culture, their [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=537.4s)]
*  language, and they began ultimately killing them. They killed 14,000 of them. And it prompted a [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=544.12s)]
*  civil war in the country. And the Russian response, which was illegal, I have no sympathy [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=552.44s)]
*  towards Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Putin is a gangster and he's a thug, but his response [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=562.68s)]
*  in the Dombass was not irrational. So I guess the question becomes, if you were elected president, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=571.32s)]
*  would you stop sending armaments to Ukraine? I would immediately have a ceasefire [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=578.6800000000001s)]
*  and I would settle the war. And I think it can be a settle. I don't even know. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=587.6400000000001s)]
*  I mean, listen, the best settlement for this war was outlined in the Minsk Accords in 2014. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=593.88s)]
*  The Minsk Accords, which all the European countries agreed upon, was when the Russians and the Russian [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=599.8s)]
*  people in Dombass voted to leave Russia and Russia did not want them, Russia said, no, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=609.32s)]
*  let's develop an accord, an agreement, which would make Dombass an autonomous region within the [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=615.72s)]
*  Ukraine, which would agree to not put missile systems in Ukraine, NATO missile systems, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=622.44s)]
*  which would agree that Ukraine would not join NATO. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=628.84s)]
*  If Zelensky says, no, I want to keep fighting, would you stop sending US weapons? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=632.2s)]
*  I would settle this. I would settle this war. Ukraine cannot fight without US support. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=636.6800000000001s)]
*  So then at some point you would tell Zelensky, if I'm reading into what you're saying correctly, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=643.1600000000001s)]
*  hey, settle it or we're out. I would settle the war. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=647.64s)]
*  Do you think that we somehow allowed Zelensky to believe that we would allow him into NATO? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=654.36s)]
*  Meaning, do you think that US foreign policy somehow almost induced this thing to happen? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=663.88s)]
*  I just want to try to understand the boundaries. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=670.6s)]
*  We have been doing integrative military exercises with the Ukrainian military. So we were [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=672.44s)]
*  actively integrating them into NATO forces. There was no question that the one thing that Putin said [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=679.5600000000001s)]
*  from the outset, this is a red line. When my uncle was president, one of the things that he said, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=688.0400000000001s)]
*  he said a couple of things. He said, number one, the principal job of a president of the United [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=694.5200000000001s)]
*  States is to keep the nation out of war. And he succeeded doing that during his term in office. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=700.2s)]
*  He sent 16,000 military advisors to Vietnam who were not authorized to participate in combat. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=705.48s)]
*  That didn't mean that some of them didn't. They were not authorized. In fact, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=714.0400000000001s)]
*  that was fewer federal troops than he sent to get James Meredith into the University of [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=719.08s)]
*  Mississippi. So he sent fewer to Vietnam and two weeks before he died, he signed a national security [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=724.36s)]
*  order ordering all of those troops home by 1965 for the first thousand to come home that month, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=732.12s)]
*  by November. And he died two weeks later. So, and then of course, Johnson came in and remanded the [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=738.6800000000001s)]
*  war and sent 250,000 troops over there, which is what all of my uncle's military advisors wanted [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=745.4s)]
*  him to do. And he stood up to them. One of the other things my uncle said, and you know, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=751.24s)]
*  the anniversary of his speech at American University, which is an extraordinary speech, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=757.08s)]
*  probably one of the best in American history, Jeff Sachs has called it the most important speech [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=761.4s)]
*  in American history. It was a speech to the American people. And it was an extraordinary speech [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=767.8s)]
*  because he read it is asking them to put themselves into the shoes of the Russians [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=775.4s)]
*  and understand that the Russians bore the brunt of World War II. They lost one out of every 13 [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=783.48s)]
*  Russians died in that war. A third of their country was occupied and leveled to the ground. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=789.48s)]
*  It's like he said, it's as if the entire East Coast of the United States to Chicago was put [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=794.76s)]
*  into rubble. And he described this in detail for the American people to say, you know, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=801.4000000000001s)]
*  we're all people, we're all on an arc, and we need to we need to understand each other's motives [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=808.36s)]
*  and not just vilify each other. And what we're seeing now is this formula vilification, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=815.4000000000001s)]
*  this narrative that we saw with Saddam Hussein was, you know, Putin with every little war that [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=821.6400000000001s)]
*  we want to get into those guys are pure evil, we're pure good, and we're going to go rescue, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=826.6s)]
*  you know, the damsel in distress. Just on that, could you contrast and compare [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=833.16s)]
*  just maybe the last three or four presidents on this very narrow dimension of that of JFK's promise [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=837.48s)]
*  of what a president should be doing, Bush, Obama, Trump, and now Biden? How do you see [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=843.8000000000001s)]
*  the things that these guys have gotten right? And or very wrong here on that dimension, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=849.8000000000001s)]
*  just on that dimension? You know, I've been friends with Joe Biden for many, many years. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=855.32s)]
*  Joe Biden is, you know, he's a go to war guy. He was one of the strongest supporters of the Iraq [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=860.2s)]
*  war. He's been a supporter of every war that's come along. And that, you know, I think that's [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=866.12s)]
*  one of the reasons that, you know, some of those that portion of the Democratic Party, which is a [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=870.6800000000001s)]
*  very, very powerful kind of king pickers was very happy with him getting an office is that he never [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=876.36s)]
*  says no to a war. I think Trump, you know, I liked a lot of what Trump said about foreign policy, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=883.72s)]
*  about disentangling us from this knee jerk reaction of, you know, of constant wars and that the cause [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=890.9200000000001s)]
*  that that imposes on our country, what it's doing, it's hollowing out our middle class. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=899.24s)]
*  But then Trump did a lot of things, including walking away from the, you know, from [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=904.12s)]
*  the Intermediate Nuclear Missile Treaty, which is it was another provocation for Russia, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=909.08s)]
*  because that treaty, you know, we're putting these intermediate missile systems all along [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=918.28s)]
*  the Russian border in Romania and Poland and, you know, and in Ukraine. And those missiles can hit [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=924.36s)]
*  Cuba, I mean, can hit Moscow in a few minutes. So there was a very destabilizing system, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=934.92s)]
*  we all signed it and he walked away from it. And now I don't think that was a I think that was [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=942.04s)]
*  another provocation, we should be de escalating these provocations, though, you know, the why [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=947.0799999999999s)]
*  it did NATO is what George Kennan said, after, after, you know, the Soviet Union collapse, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=953.0s)]
*  why do we even have NATO anymore? Why do we have it? Why do we have it unless we're going to [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=961.72s)]
*  involve the Russians in it? Why don't we do a Marshall Plan for Russia? We won the war, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=967.3199999999999s)]
*  they are the losers. They admit they're the losers, but they want to join the European community. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=972.92s)]
*  Let's make that easy for them. Let's not continue to treat them as if they're the enemy, because [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=980.36s)]
*  that is a self fulfilling prophecy. And that unfortunately is what we did. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=985.24s)]
*  Let's pivot then, you want to contain and you would force everybody to the table to a resolution, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=991.24s)]
*  if I'm understanding correctly, you weren't explicit in terms of would you remove support, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=997.0s)]
*  but I think we can infer from it, you would have a point at which you would stop sending armaments [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1001.8s)]
*  to Ukraine. We have tremendous moral pressure and economic pressure and everything else on Ukraine. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1006.28s)]
*  How about this, Jason? I mean, would you be willing to take NATO expansion off the table [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1013.56s)]
*  if it helps resolve this conflict? Yeah, everybody's Biden won't. Well, Biden won't, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1018.1199999999999s)]
*  right? Yeah, no, no, it's absolutely. Why are we trying to expand? We gave our word [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1022.28s)]
*  we would not expand NATO one inch to the east. And now we've gone to 13 countries. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1027.96s)]
*  You know, it's a it is a provocation. Let's talk about Taiwan. So [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1033.8799999999999s)]
*  we got to stay out of wars. If Xi Jinping decides Taiwan is strategic and he invades Taiwan, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1039.88s)]
*  what would your response be if you were elected president? Well, my response would be to de [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1046.0400000000002s)]
*  escalate that conflict. There's essentially a war party in Washington that is is encouraging that [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1050.5200000000002s)]
*  conflict that is drumming up that conflict. What I would do is I would I would de escalate it. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1060.7600000000002s)]
*  De escalate it. I would stop looking at it as a threat right now and and and allow [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1068.76s)]
*  the Chinese and the Taiwanese to come to their own solution about what kind of relationship they have. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1076.76s)]
*  And I think that that that if we stop our provocations toward the Chinese, that that [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1083.3999999999999s)]
*  would naturally de escalate. And if China decided it's strategic and we're going in anyway, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1089.3999999999999s)]
*  would you if you were president defend Taiwan? That's a question that I would not answer. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1094.92s)]
*  I'm curious, why not? Why don't presidential candidates just answer that question? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1102.6000000000001s)]
*  Because you're committing the country to a war in the future. That would be probably the bloodiest [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1106.52s)]
*  war ever fought. And it's not something that strategically it's not good strategy to protect [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1113.4s)]
*  reject your your intentions. You want to leave room for negotiation, you want to leave [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1120.44s)]
*  room for all kinds of movements, and you want to have a debate with the American people [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1127.24s)]
*  and with Congress. Biden's been clear that he would defend it, right? So that's an it's an [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1131.3999999999999s)]
*  interesting insight right there. Freeburg, do you want to talk maybe a little bit about the economy [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1135.96s)]
*  and the spending that we're seeing? Yeah. So Robert, I think my biggest question, I've [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1141.08s)]
*  referenced this on the show a number of times, is this extraordinary concern I have [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1145.96s)]
*  about the fiscal deficit and the debt level of the US running deficits north of a trillion dollars [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1153.0s)]
*  a year, 33 trillion in total debt. Some people use the debt to GDP metric, which you know, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1161.32s)]
*  at this point is approaching or has exceeded 130%. And 52 nations that have reached that [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1167.6399999999999s)]
*  level of debt to GDP, only one of them has not had to restructure their currency or restructure [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1175.32s)]
*  their debt payments. Obviously, with the debt ceiling approaching and some [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1182.6s)]
*  fiscal conservatives using this moment as a point to try and generate leverage, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1188.4399999999998s)]
*  I guess my biggest question for the country now and going forward is, you know, do we actually [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1193.56s)]
*  have the ability to pursue all of these interests on a social, geopolitical, a security agenda [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1200.36s)]
*  and do so without having either a balanced budget or a plan that says here are the boundaries and [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1207.8799999999999s)]
*  here are the boundary conditions? Because in the last couple of years, and particularly [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1217.32s)]
*  in the last five years, we've seen almost like a bipartisan, unmitigated spending spree [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1221.6399999999999s)]
*  that, you know, is largely driven to, you know, to do what the electorate wants, which is to give [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1228.68s)]
*  people stuff. And giving people stuff costs money and that money has to be paid back at some point. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1233.8s)]
*  I guess, how do you think about the importance of this? And how do you think about the boundary [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1239.8s)]
*  conditions that you would, you know, look to articulate and impose as you, you know, think [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1245.56s)]
*  about this role with respect to the deficit spending and the debt levels for this country? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1252.28s)]
*  In terms of a boundary, I, you know, I would love to hear arguments about that. But I, you know, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1257.56s)]
*  as you say, I think the debt is now 32 trillion, the GDP, our GDP is around 25 [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1265.3999999999999s)]
*  trillion. So that is, that's just a really alarming ratio. If you look at why, you know, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1273.0s)]
*  the primary cause are our military expenditures. We're spending eight this year, I think, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1280.12s)]
*  $8.4 trillion on the military budget this year. But if you throw in the homeland security and all [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1285.72s)]
*  that surveillance and security expenditures at home, it's 1.1 trillion a year. That's 1.1 trillion [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1296.6000000000001s)]
*  a year that is attributable to, essentially to our, you know, warmongering. And I don't think we can [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1304.44s)]
*  afford to be policemen of the world anymore. We have 800 bases around the world. We need to start [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1312.44s)]
*  rebuilding our middle class at home. We need to be responsible with our debt. And we need, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1318.04s)]
*  my grandfather always said, we should make America too expensive to conquer. We should make fortress [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1323.88s)]
*  America. We should arm America to the teeth at home so that, so we're too expensive to conquer. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1331.16s)]
*  And then we should concentrate on building up our economic power and a robust middle class [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1338.12s)]
*  as what's going to make America strong. And instead of projecting military strength abroad, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1344.1999999999998s)]
*  we ought to be projecting our economic strength and a marketplace of ideas and economic power. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1350.04s)]
*  I, you know, right now we're borrowing six, $6 billion a day, mainly from the Chinese and [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1357.4799999999998s)]
*  Japanese just to serve the interests on that debt. That's not a healthy thing for America to be. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1365.64s)]
*  And we got to figure out, you know, a way to impose fiscal discipline. But I can't tell you [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1370.3600000000001s)]
*  exactly what my boundaries would be. That's something I need to think about. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1376.1200000000001s)]
*  Soterios Johnson 30 minutes But how do you, how do you think about that? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1380.6000000000001s)]
*  Like, I think non, of discretionary spending, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1384.76s)]
*  you know, defense is, is about 800 billion, non-defense is about 900 billion. And then [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1389.48s)]
*  obviously there's social security benefits, Medicare, Medicaid. In order to get the budget [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1394.92s)]
*  balanced, you think cutting defense would be kind of the first priority and you could kind of get [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1401.4s)]
*  there through, you know, that approach. But I, there still seems to be a big gap to me on, you [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1406.92s)]
*  know, given how much we're spending on how do we actually get there? Are we ultimately going to have [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1412.2s)]
*  to kind of change retirement benefits, restructure Medicare, Medicaid, or are we going to raise taxes, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1416.92s)]
*  or are we going to do all three to get to this point? Otherwise, we have this obviously kind of [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1423.1599999999999s)]
*  never ending debt spiral that that's going to cause a massive crisis, whether it's not this year, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1427.1599999999999s)]
*  maybe it's in five years or 10 years. Right now, it's projected social security will go bankrupt [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1431.96s)]
*  in 2035, 2034 around that range. So this is coming up fast. What are we going to be cutting besides [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1437.0s)]
*  defense? And are we going to be raising taxes to 70%? Do you think to kind of bridge this hole? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1443.48s)]
*  I can't answer that question any better than I already have. You know, I think there are targets [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1449.0s)]
*  for opportunity in the homeland security. I think once we stop fighting these wars all over the [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1455.16s)]
*  world, there's a lot less need for us to have a surveillance state at home. So the real cost in [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1463.16s)]
*  the military is 1.1 trillion a year, not just the 800 trillion that shows up on the books. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1468.52s)]
*  And I think those are targets for opportunity. And I can't, you know, I have to know I need to [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1475.64s)]
*  study more the issue about how to how to get back into a balanced budget. I you know, one of the [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1481.5600000000002s)]
*  things I'd say disturbs me is that I don't think we should be playing chicken in Congress about [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1487.72s)]
*  raising the debt ceiling. Because I think I don't think we should mess around with the full faith [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1496.2s)]
*  and credit of the United States, particularly at this point in time. One of the things that's [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1501.8s)]
*  happened in the world, Bobby said, there's been a couple of countries, France is probably the [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1506.52s)]
*  best example that had to raise the retirement age. And irrespective of the view that one has on [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1512.76s)]
*  whether that was right or wrong. The practical reality of doing it is just that when these [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1522.28s)]
*  initial social safety nets were passed, the average life expectancy of folks was 10, 15 years [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1528.12s)]
*  less than what they are today. And presumably, as we keep inventing technologies, folks are going to [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1535.2399999999998s)]
*  live to 80 90 100 years on average, which may seem implausible, but is likely if you look at the trend. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1541.08s)]
*  I'm just curious how you think about the state of our social safety net. And what has to change? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1548.84s)]
*  What would you keep the same? And what has to be totally reimagined for what the world will look [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1557.24s)]
*  like in 30 or 40 years? I would say it's a red line for me to touch social security, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1562.28s)]
*  or Medicaid or Medicare. I think we need to take care of people, particularly people who [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1568.6s)]
*  have spent their whole life playing into a system with a promise at the end of it, and have worked [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1573.32s)]
*  hard and saved and done what they're supposed to do. I don't think they, you know, it's right to [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1580.4399999999998s)]
*  pull the rug out from under them. But again, I, this is an issue that I need to spend more time [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1588.12s)]
*  looking at and studying. Maybe the next time I come back here, I'll have a better answer for you guys. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1595.08s)]
*  I think this is my concern is sorry, but Robert, the comment you just made is the same comment I [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1601.08s)]
*  hear from both sides of the aisle, that we can't touch social security, Medicare, Medicaid, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1607.0s)]
*  because it would be so unpopular, we wouldn't get elected. And that's ultimately kind of what [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1612.68s)]
*  a democracy like ours may lead to, is that folks vote and elect representatives that are going to [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1617.64s)]
*  create these systems that benefit them. But in aggregate, we may not be able to support those [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1625.24s)]
*  benefits over time and at scale. And we may be facing that moment sooner than any of us want to. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1630.04s)]
*  And I think it's one of the more pressing issues and concerns, not just for the United States, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1636.6000000000001s)]
*  but for the global economy, that if the US doesn't resolve this massive hole, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1642.0400000000002s)]
*  talking about social security, for example, going bankrupt in the next 12 years, as one acute example [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1649.16s)]
*  of that problem set, you know, we may not be able to turn it around. And I mean, do you think that [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1655.72s)]
*  politics is set up to solve the structural economic problems that the US is now facing? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1662.52s)]
*  Because so much of politics ends up leading towards what additional benefits can I provide to my, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1668.6s)]
*  the folks that get me elected? Here's the thing is, we spent $8 trillion in the war in Iraq, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1674.28s)]
*  $8 trillion, and we got nothing for it. Yeah, that's pretty nuts. That's nuts. In fact, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1682.2s)]
*  we got worse than nothing. We killed more Iraqis than Saddam Hussein, we killed a million Iraqis, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1687.6399999999999s)]
*  probably. We created ISIS, we turned Iraq into a proxy for Iran, which is exactly what we've been [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1692.44s)]
*  not trying to do for 40 years. And we drove 2 million refugees with the Iraq war and its [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1699.96s)]
*  aftermath, Syria and Yemen and, you know, Pakistan and Afghanistan, 2 million refugees in Europe, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1706.92s)]
*  destabilized democracy in Europe. And we go ahead, so $8 trillion there, we spent $16 trillion on the [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1713.4s)]
*  pandemic, on the lockdown, and again, got nothing in return. So that's $24 trillion. And now we're [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1721.32s)]
*  doing bank bailouts every, you know, couple of months. Silicon Valley Bank, the Fed said that it [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1728.2s)]
*  was printing $300 billion for that, made up for all of the, you know, deflationary steps that the [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1735.72s)]
*  Biden administration had previously taken. So you go to, you know, you go to an American who's been [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1746.76s)]
*  working their whole life, and has been promised at the end of the life that they're going to get a [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1754.28s)]
*  few bucks every month. And, you know, I have a friend who I brought to my speech with me, who's, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1758.84s)]
*  during the same month that we committed another $750 million during March, we sent $750 million [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1767.08s)]
*  extra to the Ukraine. We got 15 million Americans from Medicare. My friend got a call from the [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1774.6799999999998s)]
*  government on his cell phone, a recorded call saying that your food stamps have just been [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1785.6399999999999s)]
*  cut by 90%. He went from $283 a month to $25 a month. So you try to feed yourself on $25 a month. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1791.56s)]
*  There are 30 million Americans who are starving right now. And that to me is unacceptable. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1803.56s)]
*  And it's hard to go to people like that, people who have been honest, who played by the rules, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1811.0s)]
*  who have done everything that they were supposed to do with the promise that they would be taken [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1816.6s)]
*  care of, that their health care would be taken care of at an old age. You go to those people and [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1821.48s)]
*  say, okay, now we're going to cut your food stamps and try to feed yourself on $25 a month, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1826.44s)]
*  try to feed yourself for $25 a week. We're telling them that. And then, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1833.56s)]
*  and then spending $800 billion to make a plane. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1840.6000000000001s)]
*  How are you going to cut the federal budget when you're sending over $100 billion to Ukraine? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1843.0800000000002s)]
*  You have no more authority to do it. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1847.48s)]
*  I want to finish up by saying, you know, you're like tinkering in the engine room when the ship [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1848.92s)]
*  is sinking, you know, because, you know, the order or switching deck chairs on the Titanic. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1854.84s)]
*  Let's deal with the real problem. Let's figure out how to make this nation a nation that is [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1862.04s)]
*  really focused on taking care of our people inside rather than saying, okay, well, in order to pay [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1867.0s)]
*  for the Ukraine war, we got to screw every American on social security and Medicare. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1872.9199999999998s)]
*  We've had, by the way, the inflation that we've created from, you know, from just printing money [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1879.32s)]
*  is making my friend Keith's food twice expensive. So the cost of stables in this country has raised [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1887.6399999999999s)]
*  by 76% in two years. And now they're cutting his food stamps and bailing out the same month, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1893.7199999999998s)]
*  $300 million, this Silicon Valley bank. We got to, I mean, it doesn't make any sense. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1900.76s)]
*  And having this kind of conversation, how do we screw the poor to make sure that we can, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1906.84s)]
*  you know, we can milk them while we're doing all of this crazy. It's like this country is acting [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1913.08s)]
*  like the alcoholic who is behind on his mortgage and who takes the milk money and goes into the [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1919.56s)]
*  bar and buys rounds for strangers. You know, that's what you're dealing with. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1926.52s)]
*  That's a pretty good analogy. Shots, everybody. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1930.52s)]
*  So let me ask the follow up question on this debt ceiling fight, which is a game of chicken. And the [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1934.52s)]
*  country's economy might go off a cliff in the next month because Republicans and Democrats can't [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1941.48s)]
*  agree. So Biden's position is I want a clean debt ceiling increase, no terms on it. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1946.04s)]
*  The House Republicans have passed a debt ceiling increase, but it contains things like a 1% cap on [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1953.56s)]
*  spending growth. It claws back unspent COVID-19 relief funds and it would halt Biden's student [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1962.12s)]
*  debt forgiveness plan. So Robert, I guess the question to you would be, would you negotiate? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1969.2399999999998s)]
*  Like what would your posture to House Republicans be? Would you be willing to negotiate? Because [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1975.8s)]
*  Biden is basically saying I will not negotiate at all. So negotiate or not negotiate, I guess [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1980.6799999999998s)]
*  that's my question to you. You have to negotiate. I'm not sure if he's posturing, you know, or what [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1985.6399999999999s)]
*  they have to negotiate. They have to, you know, they have to work out something that's good for [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1991.72s)]
*  our country. And that, you know, and they're going to both sides are going to have to give up [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=1995.9599999999998s)]
*  something. We have to, you know, we have to put our country first. And it's insane to play this [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2000.84s)]
*  game of chicken with, you know, with this, when the stakes are so high. There's been a lot of talk, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2007.1599999999999s)]
*  Robert, about the deep state, the FBI, DOJ, CIA, your family, obviously having dealt with [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2014.36s)]
*  two tragic assassinations, your father and your uncle has dealt with this firsthand in terms of [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2020.68s)]
*  just having the CIA information about these assassinations released. I'm curious your position [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2026.04s)]
*  on some of the most radical proposals people have this election cycle of dismantling the FBI, CIA, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2033.3200000000002s)]
*  DOJ, aka the deep state. Do you believe there's a deep state? And how would you as president [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2043.8s)]
*  deal with this intelligence operation we have? And then also personally, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2050.2s)]
*  what are your personal feelings on it? Well, on the, you know, I have, I have a pretty clear idea [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2057.64s)]
*  about how I would handle the intelligence agencies. And in fact, my father was thinking very [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2067.24s)]
*  deeply about that at the time. My father who believed his, you know, first reaction when his [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2074.68s)]
*  brother was killed was that the CIA had killed him. And in fact, the first three calls he made [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2079.96s)]
*  on that day, and, you know, I was home at the time and John McComb, the CIA was right across the [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2086.2799999999997s)]
*  street from my house. And so John McComb was the CIA director, you would come to our house and swim [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2094.04s)]
*  every day after work during the spring and summertime. And my father called the CIA desk [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2099.8s)]
*  and talked to a desk officer and said, did your people do this? That was his first call. And he [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2106.92s)]
*  called Harry Ruiz, who was a Cuban, who was one of the Cubans who had remained friendly with my [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2111.88s)]
*  family. You know, while we were surrounded by Cubans growing up because of who were Bay of [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2119.2400000000002s)]
*  Pigs refugees, my father had got them freed after a year and, you know, in the [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2124.7599999999998s)]
*  cashless prisons. And, and my father and mother spent a lot of time finding houses for them, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2131.64s)]
*  schools, integrating them to the US military, finding jobs. And so we were all raised very, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2139.72s)]
*  very closely with the Cuban community, but gradually they turned away from my family. But this [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2144.8399999999997s)]
*  one Cuban who had been an engineer had fought with Castro and then turned against him when he [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2151.8s)]
*  became communist was very close friends with my father. The second call that he made was to Harry [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2157.08s)]
*  Ruiz and he said, did our people, meaning the CIA people do this? And, and that was, and so [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2163.1600000000003s)]
*  my father was thinking very, very, very carefully about how to handle the CIA. He had been, you know, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2173.9599999999996s)]
*  he had been essentially managing the CIA since he came into office. And he recognized that the [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2181.3999999999996s)]
*  problem, and, you know, as I talked about in my speech, and I think David on this show mentioned [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2188.04s)]
*  this, that during the Bay of Pigs invasion, my uncle realized that he had been lied to by, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2193.7999999999997s)]
*  by Charles Bell and Alan Dulles and Richard Bitzel, the heads of the CIA, as well as his [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2201.0s)]
*  Joint Chiefs. And he came out in the middle of the invasion when it turned against them. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2206.68s)]
*  And he realized these, these men were being killed on the beach. And he said, I want to take the CIA [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2212.7599999999998s)]
*  and shatter it into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the wind. So he recognized that the function [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2217.3999999999996s)]
*  of the intelligence agencies had devolved and that they were, they had become captive of the [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2223.3999999999996s)]
*  military industrial complex and the military contractors. And their, their function was [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2229.16s)]
*  essentially to provide our nation with a constant pipeline of new wars to feed the military industrial [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2236.2799999999997s)]
*  complex and the growth of the surveillance state. And my father, when he ran for president, Pete [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2244.52s)]
*  Hamill, who was one of his favorite news men, asked him on the bus during two weeks before he died. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2250.7599999999998s)]
*  Asked him what he was going to do about the CIA. And he said, what we need to do is to, we need to [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2259.56s)]
*  remove the espionage division, the espionage branch from the plans division. The plans division, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2266.92s)]
*  the CIA is essentially the dirty tricks provision. That's the division, the action division. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2276.12s)]
*  They do the assassinations, they fix elections, they do paramilitary operations, black ops, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2283.96s)]
*  torture, black sites, all of that stuff. The espionage division and CIA was originally [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2289.24s)]
*  set up by Cuba, by Truman as an espionage agency. Espionage means information gathering and analysis. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2295.08s)]
*  It's not violence. It's about information acquisition. And unfortunately, the, the, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2303.56s)]
*  the clandestine action division was wagging the espionage dog. So the function of the espionage [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2311.16s)]
*  division was to provide new actions, things to do for the clandestine division, and then covering up [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2320.2799999999997s)]
*  their mistakes. So there was never any accountability. And what my father understood [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2328.52s)]
*  is that the espionage division should not be working for the clandestine services. They should [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2334.2s)]
*  be overseeing them and particularly doing accountability. Oh, you know, what if the CIA [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2339.64s)]
*  looks the way that the CIA looks at the war in Iraq is it was a success because we accomplished [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2349.56s)]
*  our mission of deposing Saddam Hussein. But and you know, the CIA was George Tenet who lied to [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2355.3199999999997s)]
*  President Bush and said it's a slam dunk. So they got us to go in there at weapons of mass [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2361.96s)]
*  So as president, would you rethink it? And then just as a final question, as a final follow up to [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2367.96s)]
*  that, do you believe they murdered or were involved in the murder of your uncle? What have you come [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2374.68s)]
*  to personally? Yes, they were definitely involved in the murder and that, you know, and the six [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2380.52s)]
*  year cover up, they're still not releasing the, you know, the papers that legally they have to [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2385.56s)]
*  release. But I don't think there's any doubt if you look at this huge, you know, mountain, monumental [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2390.52s)]
*  mountain of evidence and confessions and, you know, so many people have confessed to their involvement [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2398.12s)]
*  and, you know, we understand the if you look, I mean, for anybody who has doubts about that, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2403.88s)]
*  I would recommend a book by Jim Douglas called The Unspeakable, because I think he's done a better [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2411.72s)]
*  job than anybody else at kind of assembling and distilling all of the millions and millions of [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2417.48s)]
*  documents that have been released over the past 50 years. And these things, these revelations are [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2424.84s)]
*  released incrementally. And so nobody really takes notice of when you put them all together, the [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2432.84s)]
*  story is very clear. So you would definitely rethink the CIA, the FBI, DOJ, you know, the whole [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2437.4s)]
*  intelligence. At the minimum, I think what you're saying as well as maybe you would also [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2443.4s)]
*  release the documents that maybe would at least provide some more transparency. I just wanted [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2449.2400000000002s)]
*  to build on that because you had a very provocative tweet. Part of what you're talking about is [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2454.52s)]
*  accountability, and we need data and transparency to have that. There are people that have whistle [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2460.28s)]
*  blown. There are people that have leaked. And I think it's fair to say that they've all been treated [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2465.56s)]
*  by the security apparatus in largely the exact same way. But you tweeted recently about your [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2471.64s)]
*  desire to see some of those folks forgiven and pardoned. Do you want to just take a few minutes [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2478.44s)]
*  just to talk about some of those folks that you think has allowed us to actually see the truth if [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2483.56s)]
*  we want to see it and why you think that and what you think should be done with folks like that? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2489.0s)]
*  I mean, Julian Assange is an example. Julian Assange is a newspaper publisher. He published [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2492.2799999999997s)]
*  leaked documents. You know, why are we? I mean, if I was any newspaper publisher in this country, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2499.0800000000004s)]
*  I would be worried about that. And now he can go to jail for life because he published leaked [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2506.1200000000003s)]
*  documents of great import to the American people of things that should not have been secret, that [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2510.84s)]
*  we should have known about. Revelations that affect our civil rights, affect our foreign policy, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2515.96s)]
*  affect things that we have a right to know about. And, you know, it's really [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2524.2s)]
*  strange that there's any support for his imprisonment among the press. And I think the [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2530.52s)]
*  press is beginning to figure this out. Finally, the most controversial of those figures is Edwin [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2534.52s)]
*  Snowden. But Edwin Snowden released documents that showed us that we were all being spied upon. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2540.12s)]
*  And that's important for Americans to know. And in fact, it was so important that Congress passed [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2549.56s)]
*  laws based upon his revelations to protect the American people. So why are we punishing the [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2557.24s)]
*  whistleblower rather than punishing the people who were, you know, who were illegally spying on us? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2563.48s)]
*  That's what we should be doing. We shouldn't be jailing dissenters in our country. We shouldn't be [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2570.52s)]
*  jailing whistleblowers. We should be jailing the people who break the law. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2576.28s)]
*  To keep this bipartisan, do you believe the deep state is acting to subvert the Trump presidency [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2579.64s)]
*  and that they are framing him on these three or four indictments that they are working on, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2587.48s)]
*  some that have dropped, some that haven't? Do you believe there's a deep state [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2594.76s)]
*  conspiracy against Trump? Because you might be facing him. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2598.36s)]
*  I don't use the word deep state. I mean, I've described how these bureaucracies function. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2601.0s)]
*  It's not so much a group of people. The kind of deep state implies there's a group of people and [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2611.88s)]
*  it's kind of, you know, black coats in a smoky room pulling strings. But the corruption is systemic. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2617.56s)]
*  The these, you know, all of these agencies are captive agencies. The CIA is ultimately working [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2625.08s)]
*  for industry like the oil industry, the coal industry, and the military contractors. And [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2634.04s)]
*  they've always had that tie since the very beginning. You know, Alan Dulles, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2639.88s)]
*  who had worked for Sullivan Cromwell and ended up doing coup d'etats on behalf of his former [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2644.84s)]
*  clients like Texaco and United Fruit, Texaco and BP in Iran in 1953. His former client, United Fruit, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2649.88s)]
*  when Jacob Arbenz in Guatemala tried to nationalize United Fruit, you know, the CIA under Dulles went [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2659.08s)]
*  over through the government to protect the interests of his former clients. So there's always [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2668.28s)]
*  been these ties to industry and the ties now, and particularly the oil industry, and the ties to [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2672.04s)]
*  to the military industrial contractors really drive CIA action and CIA intelligence. And we have to, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2679.48s)]
*  you know, you have to stop. And this is systemic in all these agencies. I mean, USDA is run by Cargill, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2688.28s)]
*  Smithfield, Monsanto, Bo Pilgrim, John Tyson, EPA is run. When we sued EPA, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2696.04s)]
*  we got discovery documents that showed that the head of the pesticide division, Jess Rowland, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2705.0s)]
*  had been secretly working for Monsanto for a decade. And you know, sending memos back and [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2711.96s)]
*  forth with Monsanto directing them, you need to kill this study, you need to kill that study. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2717.96s)]
*  And this unfortunately is not the exception. It is the rule. Most of the people who work for those [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2722.6800000000003s)]
*  agencies are good citizens. They're good Americans. They're honest and they're patriotic. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2728.2000000000003s)]
*  And they're patriots. But the people who tend to rise in those agencies and occupy these very, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2733.4s)]
*  very powerful key positions for decades or years, like Anthony Fauci, 50 years, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2739.2400000000002s)]
*  are people who are in the tank with industry. And what we need to do is unravel that across [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2745.4s)]
*  the government. And that's really what people say that's the deep state. That really is what [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2752.36s)]
*  is a systemic corruption within our agencies that is driven by agency capture. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2756.92s)]
*  Can we actually just talk about the Coronavirus, maybe pandemic for a second? And I just want to [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2764.76s)]
*  tie in two concepts. Sometimes, again, there's a lot of mainstream misinformation about it. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2769.2400000000002s)]
*  There is a lot that came out about you, particularly as it relates to vaccines. I [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2776.52s)]
*  just want to give you an opportunity to set the record straight. Just on what you think happened [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2781.32s)]
*  COVID, all that corruption, your thought on vaccines, the efficacy of our programs, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2785.72s)]
*  how we should change, what we keep the same, just maybe a chance to clear the air so that we can [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2789.72s)]
*  get some of the gobbledygook on the internet set straight. I mean, it's hard to, you know, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2793.7999999999997s)]
*  I wrote a 250,000-page book about it, and I've written a couple of books. And so it's hard to [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2801.56s)]
*  summarize, you know, what went wrong in a second. But essentially, we had instead of a [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2807.56s)]
*  public health response to a public health crisis, we had a militarized and monetized response that [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2816.68s)]
*  was the inverse of what, of everything that you would want to do if you actually wanted to protect [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2822.2s)]
*  public health. We've known, you know, if you look at WHO protocols or CDC protocols, the EU, the NHS [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2828.12s)]
*  in Britain, all those, they all had protocols for how to manage the pandemic. They all said [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2836.3599999999997s)]
*  unanimously, you do not use lockdowns, mass lockdowns. You quarantine the sick, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2841.96s)]
*  you protect the vulnerable, but you keep society moving because the consequences of not, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2849.32s)]
*  of shutting down society will be cataclysmic beyond anything that the disease is going to impose. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2855.16s)]
*  Everybody knew that. And so, you know, we had these agencies that had drilled for years and years [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2861.7200000000003s)]
*  this alternative, you know, militarized response. And instead of, you know, doing what you want to [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2870.36s)]
*  do, which is to get early treatment to people, to have, I mean, you know, we live in the age [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2878.04s)]
*  of the internet, we should have had a grid that connected all 15 million frontline doctors, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2883.48s)]
*  every country around the world, and figured out what are you doing that works in your country, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2889.48s)]
*  you know, and try and then distilling that information and processing it and getting it [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2894.76s)]
*  to other doctors. Well, we knew what was working. We knew Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine would [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2898.92s)]
*  work. And we knew that since 2004, because NIH did this study that said Hydroxychloroquine [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2903.96s)]
*  obliterates coronavirus. We knew what would work at that time. And what was the response? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2909.4s)]
*  They, the response was they could not allow early treatment to occur. Why? Because there's a little [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2915.88s)]
*  known federal law that says if there is a drug that is shown effective against a target disease, [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2922.92s)]
*  it is ill, a drug that is proof for any purpose. It is illegal to issue an emergency use [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2931.48s)]
*  authorization for a vaccine. So if they had admitted that Hydroxychloroquine or Ivermectin [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2940.36s)]
*  worked against coronavirus, it would have destroyed their whole hundred billion dollar vaccine, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2945.8s)]
*  you know, enterprise. So they had to kill early treatments. And they went after stuff that they [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2951.0s)]
*  knew worked. This was the first respiratory virus in history where people would go to the hospital [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2957.4s)]
*  and they would test positive for coronavirus and be symptomatic. They were sick. That's why they [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2964.68s)]
*  went to the hospital. And the hospital would say to them, there is no treatment. Go home until your [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2969.88s)]
*  lips turn blue and you can't breathe and come back and we will give you two things that are [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2976.04s)]
*  going to kill you. Remdesivir and hydroxy and ventilation. So people still look at in this [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2981.16s)]
*  country at Anthony Fauci is a hero. And we were doing things a couple of miles from me in Malibu. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2990.6s)]
*  There were police pulling surfers out of the surf and giving them thousand dollar tickets and telling [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=2998.44s)]
*  them to go home. Getting them out of the sunshine where coronavirus doesn't spread and locking them [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3003.8s)]
*  in their home where it does. And every time they sent one of these people home from the hospital [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3009.1600000000003s)]
*  sick, it was a super spreader event. Oh, you look at our record of coronavirus and this is when [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3014.44s)]
*  nobody can explain who is defending Fauci, et cetera. We had the highest body count in the world by far [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3020.76s)]
*  from coronavirus. We have 4.2% of the world's population. We had 16% of the COVID deaths. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3030.12s)]
*  How does anybody explain that? And you go to nations that didn't do what we told them. Nigeria. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3038.44s)]
*  Nigeria has the highest malaria burden in the world. So everybody gets hydroxychloroquine once [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3045.4s)]
*  a week. They call it Sunday Sunday. Everybody in the country takes it on Sunday. They had the highest [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3051.48s)]
*  river blindness burden. So half the country is on ivermectin. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3057.5600000000004s)]
*  Nigeria never had an epidemic. It had a death rate in Nigeria of 14 people per million population. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3061.88s)]
*  Our death rate, 3000 per million population. Blacks in our countries were dying at 3.6 times [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3068.76s)]
*  the rate of whites. Why were American blacks dying and Nigerian blacks weren't? And then you go to [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3075.5600000000004s)]
*  Haiti. Haiti had a, and by the way, Nigeria had a 1.3% vaccination rate. Haiti had a 1.4% vaccination [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3083.08s)]
*  rate. And they had a death rate of 15 per million population. These are the countries that Tony [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3091.96s)]
*  Fauci and Bill Gates said, we got to get them vaccinated. We got to do whatever we can because [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3099.08s)]
*  they're going to get totally wiped out because of their poverty. And guess what? They never had a [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3103.7999999999997s)]
*  pandemic. Across Africa, there was a 10% vaccination rate. And guess what? They had a death rate of [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3108.04s)]
*  about 340. Some people think that the death rate here was overstated because of incentives to do [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3114.12s)]
*  that. Do you believe that as well? So maybe part of that death rate is it was over-estimated. But [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3122.36s)]
*  you believe looking back on this, that Fauci, as well as the pharma companies, Bill Gates, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3127.32s)]
*  investments in those areas that led us down a path, if we'll call it the medical industrial, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3133.0s)]
*  the pharma industrial complex, you believe the pharma industrial complex dictated our response [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3138.92s)]
*  to coronavirus and then Freiburg, I'll let you jump in. Yeah. But you believe that that's the- [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3144.04s)]
*  I don't have any question. I believe this was, you know, as I said, it was a military response. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3150.52s)]
*  I mean, look at who was running the coronavirus response. Wouldn't you think it would be HHS? [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3160.28s)]
*  Well, when Warp Speed had to present its declassifying its organizational charts [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3169.48s)]
*  to show to the FDA committee called VRBAC, when they demanded it, and Warp Speed went in and showed [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3177.8s)]
*  them the organizational charts, the agency running Warp Speed and pandemic response was not HHS. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3184.92s)]
*  It was NSA, the National Security Agency. Avril Haines is the director of national intelligence. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3195.0s)]
*  So she was running Operation Warp Speed. And who was manufacturing? It wasn't Pfizer and Moderna. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3202.04s)]
*  It was 140 military contractors who had lines ready. And you say, you know, and then, you know, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3209.56s)]
*  all of this clamped down on civil rights that we saw, the censorship, the closing of the churches, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3217.32s)]
*  the closing of the right to assemble, the banning of jury trials against pharmaceutical companies. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3225.0s)]
*  They crushed the Seventh Amendment, the First Amendment. They closed down 3.3 million businesses [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3231.7999999999997s)]
*  with no due process, no just compensation. They obliterated the Fourth Amendment right to, you [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3237.48s)]
*  know, to against warrantless searches and seizures with all these intrusive, you know, you can get [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3244.28s)]
*  to show your medical records to go and get out of your house or to get into a public building. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3251.88s)]
*  Freberg, what is correct here? Do you believe in what is incorrect about Roberts? What's [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3256.76s)]
*  Robert saying, if anything? Well, look, I mean, there's obviously a lot of things I could say. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3260.76s)]
*  By the way, I was on the executive team at Monsanto for a couple of years. So, you know, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3263.8s)]
*  I one thing I will say is I sat at the table facing the EPA and the USDA and certainly didn't [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3267.5600000000004s)]
*  feel like a very cozy relationship in at least what I saw in the few years I was there. It was, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3274.76s)]
*  it did feel like a very kind of independent regulatory and challenging, frankly, regulatory [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3281.0s)]
*  process that Monsanto had to manage and deal with and go through and releasing new products. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3286.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, I don't think that this notion that there were kind of embedded parties that did [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3290.92s)]
*  our whims and wishes really plays true, at least from my experience sitting there. And I'm not a [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3296.44s)]
*  long time Monsanto executive. I built a software company, sold it to Monsanto and sat on the exec [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3300.6s)]
*  team for a few years after the acquisition. But I guess the more kind of, I think bigger framing [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3305.4s)]
*  question for you, Robert, is really around vaccines in general. I think your commentary [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3312.84s)]
*  around the COVID response and, you know, the influencing forces there [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3319.0s)]
*  didn't start with COVID, right? I mean, you've been a kind of, you know, outspoken voice on [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3325.72s)]
*  vaccines in general for some time. Is that a fair statement? Because I think that that's part of the [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3332.84s)]
*  media narrative around your history and legacy is that you have been kind of outspoken on vaccines [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3336.68s)]
*  and the, you know, the risks and the effects that you consider to be kind of, I don't know [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3341.96s)]
*  if it's implied or explicit with respect to the use and wide adoption of vaccines over time. Maybe [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3349.08s)]
*  you could share a little bit about your broader perspective in the years leading up to COVID [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3354.2s)]
*  and how that then kind of informed your point of view specifically on COVID. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3357.96s)]
*  Robert Hicks You know, my objective is not to vaccinate. I'm not anti-vaccinated. I'm fully [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3361.32s)]
*  vaccinated. My kids were fully vaccinated. I wish at this point that I had not done that because [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3366.04s)]
*  I know enough about them now. But my principal objective is that vaccines in the childhood vaccines [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3372.2s)]
*  are immune from pre-licensing safety testing. Of the 72, when I was a kid, I got three vaccines. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3380.2s)]
*  My children got 72 doses of 16 vaccines. And the vaccines are the one medical product that does not [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3388.28s)]
*  have to go through placebo controlled trials where you test and expose versus unexposed population [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3396.92s)]
*  prior to licensure. And there's a number of historical reasons for that that come out of the [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3403.4s)]
*  military beginnings. These vaccines were regarded as national security defenses against biological [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3409.08s)]
*  attacks in our countries. And they wanted to make sure if the Russians attacked us with anthrax [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3417.4s)]
*  or some other biological agent, they could quickly formulate and deploy [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3421.88s)]
*  vaccine to 200 million Americans with no regulatory impediments. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3426.44s)]
*  So they call them biologics rather than medicines and exempted biologics from [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3430.84s)]
*  pre-licensing safety trial. I've litigated on the issue. Not one of them has ever been [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3435.56s)]
*  tested, pre-licensure against. So nobody knows what the, you know, you can say that the [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3439.8s)]
*  vaccine is effective against a target disease, but you can't say that it's not causing worse [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3447.4s)]
*  problems. Now I'll just summarize this story. The vaccine schedule exploded in 1986. The vaccine [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3453.96s)]
*  industry succeeded in getting Ronald Reagan to sign a law. And my uncle was also, you know, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3464.44s)]
*  a group that was pressured by Wyeth, which was losing $20 in downstream liabilities [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3469.8s)]
*  on every vaccine it made because of losses for every dollar that it made. And they went to [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3476.6s)]
*  Reagan and said, we're going to get out of the vaccine business and you're going to be left [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3484.04s)]
*  without a vaccine supply unless you give us full immunity from liability. Reagan, you know, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3488.92s)]
*  reluctantly signed that. And so today, no matter how negligent the company, no matter how grievous [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3494.6800000000003s)]
*  your injury, no matter how reckless their conduct, you cannot sue them. That caused a gold rush [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3501.2400000000002s)]
*  because now you've got a product that there's no downstream liability. You're immune from that. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3506.6800000000003s)]
*  There's no upstream safety testing. So that's a $250 million saving. And there's no marketing [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3513.32s)]
*  or advertising cause. Because the federal government is going to mandate this product [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3519.56s)]
*  to 76 million American children, whether they like it or not. And there's no better product [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3524.28s)]
*  in the world. And so there was a gold rush. And instead of three vaccines, we quickly ended up [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3529.56s)]
*  with 72. And now we're going to, you know, toward 80 right now. And there's no end in sight. And a [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3534.2000000000003s)]
*  lot of those vaccines were unnecessary. They're not even for casual disease caused disease. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3540.12s)]
*  Here's what happened in 1989. Beginning in 1989. We experienced a chronic disease epidemic in this [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3545.0s)]
*  country. It is unlike anything in human history. We went from having 6% of Americans affected by [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3552.3599999999997s)]
*  chronic disease to 54% by 2006. And what do I mean by chronic disease? I mean neurological disease [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3559.72s)]
*  that I never saw when I was a kid. ADD, ADHD, Specia-A language like Tick's, Tourette's syndrome, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3567.16s)]
*  ASD, autism, narcolepsy, all of these suddenly appeared. Autism rates went from one in 10,000 [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3575.24s)]
*  to one in every 34. 1989 was the year this began. Allergic disease, peanut allergies suddenly [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3581.7999999999997s)]
*  appeared. Food allergies, eczema suddenly appeared. Anaphylaxis and asthma, you know, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3589.96s)]
*  which had been around, but it exploded. And then autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3597.8s)]
*  juvenile diabetes. I never knew a kid. I had 11 siblings, about 70 cousins. I never knew anybody [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3603.96s)]
*  with any of these diseases. And suddenly, why do five of my kids have allergies? So then, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3611.48s)]
*  if you look at the manufacturer's inserts for those 72 vaccines, there's 420 diseases that have [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3620.28s)]
*  been associated with the vaccines that are listed, including every one of those diseases that went [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3630.68s)]
*  epidemic in 1989. And this is the country which most heavily vaccinated. And this was happening [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3636.84s)]
*  here unlike any other country in the world. And so we have this, you know, and, you know, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3643.8s)]
*  it's good for the pharma. This pharma now makes 60 billion on the vaccines. When I was a kid, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3650.28s)]

*  Friedberg, do you believe that these vaccines are over prescribed and are part of the rise in ADHD [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3661.4s)]
*  and all this litany of diseases? I'm just asking Friedberg, who's our resident scientist here, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3671.7200000000003s)]
*  do you believe this? You know, explicitly, as a scientist, I'm curious. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3675.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't think there's direct evidence supporting that relationship. I think that there's a lot of [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3680.36s)]
*  environmental factors that have been driving changes in, you know, the rate of problems with [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3685.32s)]
*  autoimmunity. It relates to our food products, our food system. It relates to environmental [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3693.0s)]
*  chemistry like Robert has talked about generally. I think there's a lot of environmental [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3699.96s)]
*  conditioning that's caused this rise in problems in human health. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3704.6800000000003s)]
*  Can I interrupt for a second? Because I don't think it's solely the vaccines. Our children [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3708.28s)]
*  today are swimming around in a toxic zoo. But there's a timeline. And actually, a toxicologist [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3712.68s)]
*  that I've used in many of my lawsuits, probably the most famous in the country, Phil Landrigan, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3719.48s)]
*  looked at the timeline of the explosion of all these chronic diseases. And he said, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3724.9199999999996s)]
*  there's only a finite number of things that have caused it. You know, one is glyphosate. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3731.24s)]
*  Things that became ubiquitous in every demographic beginning around 1993, 1989. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3737.1600000000003s)]
*  One of them is glyphosate, neonicotinoid, a pesticide, PFOAs, cell phones, ultrasound, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3747.0s)]
*  and he made the whole list. And so it's a finite number. And the question is, and vaccines are part [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3753.32s)]
*  of that. And you know, it is suspicious because the vaccines list all of these side effects. Now, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3761.4s)]
*  I've put together books, you know, one of my books on this subject, on connecting these, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3767.56s)]
*  has 1400 references and 400 studies digested. So the science out there is pretty clear. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3775.48s)]
*  But we, NIH refused to study these things, because it knows that whatever, wherever they follow the [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3782.52s)]
*  dots, it's going to end up with a big shock. And so they simply have stopped studying them. And they've [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3791.64s)]
*  turned themselves into an incubator for pharmaceutical products. And they don't do this kind of basic [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3796.6s)]
*  research. I want to just give you guys one example. The most common vaccine in the world is called the [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3800.9199999999996s)]
*  DTP vaccine, diphtheria tetanus pertussis. We gave it in this country, and beginning around 79. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3807.0s)]
*  It was killing or causing severe brain injury in one out of every 300 kids who got it, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3814.8399999999997s)]
*  UCLA study funded by NIH that found it. So they got rid of it. That's what caused all the lawsuits [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3820.92s)]
*  and eventually precipitated the passage of the vaccine. We stopped it here, they stopped in [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3827.56s)]
*  Europe, but Bill Gates and WHO are still giving it to 161 million African children every year. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3832.76s)]
*  It's the most popular vaccine on earth. Bill Gates says publicly it saved 30 million lives. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3838.6800000000003s)]
*  He went to the Danish government and said, we've saved 30 million lives. Will you support this [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3845.64s)]
*  program? In 2017, the Danish said, show me the study that shows that it saved all those lives. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3849.72s)]
*  He couldn't do it. So they went down and they conducted a study in West Africa with the Danes [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3856.2s)]
*  operate all these health clinics, and they looked at 30 years of data. And as it turned out in a [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3861.64s)]
*  nation called Guinea-Bissau, half the kids in that country at the age two months had received the [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3866.9199999999996s)]
*  vaccine and half had not. It was a perfect natural experiment. And they looked at 30 years of data [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3872.6s)]
*  and what they found was that the kids who received the vaccine were not dying of diphtheria, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3879.3199999999997s)]
*  tetanus, and pertussis, but girls who received the vaccine were dying at 10 times the rate of [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3884.4399999999996s)]
*  unvaccinated girls. And they were not dying of anything ever, anybody ever associated with [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3891.7999999999997s)]
*  the vaccine. They were dying of diphtheria, of bilharzia, malaria, anemia, minor cuts and scrapes, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3896.3599999999997s)]
*  and mainly pulmonary respiratory disease and pneumonia. And what the researchers concluded, [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3904.28s)]
*  and this was a study funded by the Danish government and Novonortis, which is a vaccine [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3911.32s)]
*  company, and the scientists were all pro-vaccine. What they said is this vaccine is killing more [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3917.1600000000003s)]
*  people than the disease ever were. Nobody knew it because nobody associated the people who were [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3923.7200000000003s)]
*  dying because they were dying of all these different things. How were only the unvaccinated [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3929.64s)]
*  kids? So the vaccine had saved them from diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, but it had ruined their [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3934.6s)]
*  immune system so that they could not defend themselves against other diseases. And that's [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3940.3599999999997s)]
*  the danger of not having placebo-controlled trials prior to introducing the product, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3944.52s)]
*  particularly when you're going to mandate a product for healthy people. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3951.08s)]
*  Let's, with our remaining time here, move on to energy. You and the environment, you've got an [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3954.84s)]
*  incredible track record. I remember growing up in New York, the amazing work you did for the [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3960.76s)]
*  watershed project, and I'll let you expand upon that in a moment. But the only confounding thing [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3965.64s)]
*  I found in your position, and I'm curious if it's changed or not, is that you spent decades trying [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3971.16s)]
*  to close the Indian Point nuclear power plant in a time when clearly nuclear power has gotten safer [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3977.48s)]
*  and is clearly, I think the world believes, and certainly everybody who's on this panel believes, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3985.16s)]
*  nuclear is a key point in the transition to renewables. So what is your actual position? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3990.6s)]
*  Explain it to us as basically as you can on nuclear power, and do you regret or have you [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=3997.16s)]
*  rethought your position on Indian Point? No, I mean, Indian Point is leaking tritium into the [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4003.4s)]
*  nods every day. So I don't see how you can say it's safe. And they still haven't figured out what [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4011.4s)]
*  to do with the waste. They're now storing it. It's 18 miles from midtown Manhattan. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4018.12s)]
*  If the shack where they were storing the fuel rods had the structural integrity of a Kmart, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4024.6s)]
*  a terrorist attack against it would basically render New York [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4033.48s)]
*  uninhabited for the next 5,000 years or so. So to put something that risky so close to 10 million [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4040.84s)]
*  people doesn't make any sense. Now, nuclear power, I'm all for it if they can ever make it safe, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4050.76s)]
*  or if they ever make it economical. And it's not me saying it's not safe. It's the insurance [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4057.2400000000002s)]
*  industry. They can't get an insurance policy. If they can't get an insurance policy, then I would [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4063.1600000000003s)]
*  say I don't want it. But the American nuclear industry, I mean, you go look at what Fukushima, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4068.36s)]
*  they're poisoning the Pacific every day. They're poisoning the whole world. They're poisoning the [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4074.44s)]
*  Pacific every day with huge amounts of really deadly radiation. And they and out their only [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4079.08s)]
*  solution to it is to suck the water out of the groundwater and store it in these big tanks. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4085.3199999999997s)]
*  And if you just go on the internet and look at a picture of the Fukushima water tanks, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4091.7999999999997s)]
*  and they go on to the horizon, and there's no end to it. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4096.28s)]
*  Robert, can I just make a point? The thing with nuclear that's worth separating is [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4098.84s)]
*  that it's not the fundamental technology there that's broken in either example that you use, [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4103.4s)]
*  but it's the profit and motive that caused both the industrial engineering of both plants to be [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4109.32s)]
*  subpar. Because Fukushima, for example, was engineered not to the seismic levels that you [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4115.88s)]
*  really needed. Or elevation. Even considering all that. Here's what I would say is that, [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4120.76s)]
*  in our country, nuclear is regarded as so dangerous that they can't get insurance. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4127.4800000000005s)]
*  So the industry had to go to Congress in a sleazy legislative maneuver in the middle of the night [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4136.52s)]
*  and get the Price Anderson Act passed. So that to shift their accident burden onto the American [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4143.08s)]
*  public. So if their plant goes up, and I was 10 miles from that plant, then I'm going to have to [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4150.200000000001s)]
*  pay for it. So I don't think that's free market capitalism. I believe in free markets. And I can [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4156.04s)]
*  tell you this, there is no public utility on the face of the earth that will build one of those [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4162.04s)]
*  plants without massive public subsidies. Not one. Nobody will ever do it. And then they have to [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4168.28s)]
*  store the waste for the next 30,000 years, which is five times the length of recorded human history. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4175.4s)]
*  And if you tell me how that, you know, if they had to amortize that rate up front, there's no way [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4181.24s)]
*  anybody do it. Number two, or three or four, whatever I've gotten to. It costs now between [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4187.96s)]
*  nine and 16 billion dollars to build a nuclear power plant. Just the construction costs. And [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4195.8s)]
*  then you've got to get the technicians and then you've got to get, you know, the waste disposal, [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4202.2s)]
*  the regular outages and all of this. There's no way that it could compete in a free market. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4206.44s)]
*  I believe in free market capitalism. I am a radical free marketeer. I believe that our energy [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4211.96s)]
*  system should reflect the marketplace. And right now you can build a solar plant for a billion [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4218.919999999999s)]
*  dollars a gigawatt. You can build a wind plant for 1.2 billion dollars a gigawatt. A coal plant [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4226.599999999999s)]
*  will cost you about three and a half billion dollars a gigawatt. And then you have to pay for [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4233.0s)]
*  the fuel by cutting down the mountains of West Virginia, poisoning 22,000 miles of streams, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4237.4s)]
*  burning, you know, putting mercury that gets into every freshwater fish in America, sterilizing the [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4245.08s)]
*  lakes of the Appalachians. If they had to internalize that cause, coal, which says is that, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4250.84s)]
*  you know, it's for nuke, which says it's too cheap to meter. It turns out it's the most expensive [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4257.08s)]
*  way to boil a pot of water that's ever been divided. I'm just trying to make the point that [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4262.68s)]
*  if you look at the levelized cost of energy now, what you're saying is exactly why solar and wind [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4266.200000000001s)]
*  are winning. It's just so much cleaner. It makes so much more sense. There's no fuel cost. And if the [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4271.08s)]
*  impediment is distribution is that we don't have a grid system that can effectively, you know, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4275.72s)]
*  orchestrate a variable power. And that's what we let me provide a counter that maybe it's not about [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4283.16s)]
*  distribution, but it's about scaling production capacity. So, you know, if you look over nearly [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4288.76s)]
*  any historical time scale, since we've had industrial energy production on earth, for every [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4294.2s)]
*  1% increase in GDP per capita, you see a roughly 1.2% increase in energy consumption per capita. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4299.56s)]
*  And so if you forecast out by the end of the century, the GDP per capita estimates in the [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4306.360000000001s)]
*  US and around the world, we need to increase global energy production by roughly, you know, [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4311.8s)]
*  anywhere from 5 to 10x. And, you know, the current system of pulling carbon out of the ground and [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4317.88s)]
*  burning it up and pulling heat energy out of it doesn't scale doesn't make sense, obviously, [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4323.96s)]
*  put aside the carbon effect problem. And there appears to be, you know, reasonable chance of a [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4328.12s)]
*  pretty serious material shortage for renewable sources by the middle of next decade. So what do [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4333.0s)]
*  you think is the right answer to long range energy security? And what sort of technologies should we [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4338.52s)]

*  grow in the way that it needs to to support the population demands over the next century? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4348.28s)]
*  Dr. John F. Kennedy, Ph.D. I mean, I'm agnostic about the energy sources. And I think you need [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4353.96s)]

*  But we, I mean, we have enough energy, we have enough wind energy. In North Dakota, North Dakota [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4365.0s)]
*  is the windiest place on earth outside of the Arctic. In North Dakota, Montana and Texas, [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4372.36s)]
*  we have enough wind energy to produce five times the amount of our entire grid. The problem is, [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4378.04s)]
*  North Dakota wind farmer cannot get his product to market because it dissipates in a, you know, [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4386.599999999999s)]
*  we have an antiquated grid system that simply will not efficiently move electrons across country. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4393.08s)]
*  And we need a DC grid system that, you know, with off ramps in the big cities, etc., that can do [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4403.8s)]
*  that. In North Dakota, if you have an acre of farmland, it's worth about 300 bucks. If you [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4409.24s)]
*  put a wind turbine on it, it's worth about 3200 bucks. So every farmer in North Dakota [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4416.2s)]
*  wants to put wind turbines in their cornfields. And the problem is, they cannot get that energy [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4422.84s)]
*  to market. That is the only choke point. And if we, and the same is true, you know, in, in, in, [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4428.44s)]
*  you know, we have great solar power in this country. We have, you know, we have an abundance [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4435.4s)]
*  of renewable energy in this country. And the problem is, the incumbents were, were, were, [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4442.36s)]
*  were operating on rules, under rules that were written by the incumbents to reward the dirtiest, [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4450.28s)]
*  filthiest, most poisonous, most toxic fuels from hell rather than the cheap, clean, green, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4456.28s)]
*  wholesome fuels from heaven. And we ought to reverse that and make it, make them all competitive. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4461.799999999999s)]
*  Well, it seems like technology and economics have reversed that in a way. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4467.4s)]
*  Yeah, one last question on this. So as president, would you support initiatives [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4471.5599999999995s)]
*  that could advance and allow approval of safe nuclear fission [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4476.92s)]
*  production systems to be built here in the US? [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4483.32s)]
*  Well, I will, like, like I say, I support new and new technologies of new that are safe, [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4486.04s)]
*  you know, where they but, but as long as they can compete in a marketplace, you show me and by the [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4493.24s)]
*  way, I think we should be doing science even when there's no, you know, economic end to it. So we [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4498.68s)]
*  should be looking at this stuff. But I would not promote new if it's not competitive in the [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4504.4400000000005s)]
*  marketplace. And it's, you know, and that means, you know, cleaning up your mess after yourself, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4509.4800000000005s)]
*  which, you know, is a lesson we were all supposed to learn in kindergarten. They have to show us [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4515.16s)]
*  what they're going to do with the ways how they're going to internalize their cause, [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4519.72s)]
*  rather than what they're doing now, which is to externalize their cause and internalize their [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4523.4800000000005s)]
*  profits. Okay, we have covered a lot of territory. And I hate to get to controversial ones, [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4527.48s)]
*  like culture wars, but it's going to come up in the presidential election. I personally don't think [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4535.32s)]
*  this is what's important in the presidential election. I think the fiscal stuff, the energy [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4539.08s)]
*  stuff, the the wars and political stuff we've discussed today are much more important. But [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4542.599999999999s)]
*  I'm curious your take on the issues around Disney, DeSantis, trans, and this cohort of issues, [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4548.68s)]
*  which have become an obsession, it seems, between certain members of certain political parties, [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4558.12s)]
*  or both parties, the media, and certainly it's taken over a lot of discussions amongst the [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4564.280000000001s)]
*  generation on social media. What's your take on all this? And when you get caught up in these [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4569.0s)]
*  debates in the presidential debates about trans athletes, as but one example, do you think [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4575.08s)]
*  a trans woman who was a biological male should be able to be put in a female prison? Do you think [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4581.48s)]
*  they should be able to play on a female basketball team and change with a bunch of 15 year old girls [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4589.24s)]
*  in a high school locker room? I've already said first of all, I want to say this. I think that [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4594.5199999999995s)]
*  people, I believe in bodily autonomy, and that people's choices about what they want to do with [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4601.72s)]
*  their body should be respected and people should not be shamed. I do not believe that somebody who [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4607.72s)]
*  was born a biological man should be able to compete later on in life, whatever choice they made on a [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4615.72s)]
*  woman's team. I have a niece who is playing softball at BC. She has devoted her entire life [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4623.08s)]
*  to getting that scholarship and it's consumed her. And I've watched during my lifetime, women's sports [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4635.24s)]
*  go from essentially non-existent to equitable mainly with men's sports. And I think that's [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4643.32s)]
*  important. And I don't think that women should lose ground in any way. So I've said, [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4650.44s)]
*  I don't believe that that's the right thing, but I think everybody should be respected. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4661.4s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Let me ask a question then about parents who are struggling with this issue. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4665.4s)]
*  At what age should a doctor be allowed to perform gender reassignment surgery? [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4672.28s)]
*  On an individual, you believe adults? So at what age should you be able to have gender surgery? [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4680.280000000001s)]
*  Because this is going to come up multiple times in this debate. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4688.6s)]
*  Richard F. Reilly I think adults ought to have that choice. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4691.08s)]
*  I don't think a child should have that choice, except with, you know, certainly not without parent [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4694.6s)]
*  permission. And I really don't, you know, I know that the, you know, it's a, and let's start by [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4702.36s)]
*  saying this, this is a difficult issue. And it's an issue that we should not be judging people on [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4711.8s)]
*  and we should not be hating people about. We should be trying to solve people's problems and [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4716.68s)]
*  give people as much leeway as possible to, and as much respect, as much leeway to exercise [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4724.52s)]
*  their choices and much respect for those choices we possibly get. Within that framework, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4731.32s)]
*  I don't believe that it's, that a child without their parental permission should be allowed to [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4736.5199999999995s)]
*  choose that kind of surgery because- Aaron Ross Powell [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4742.599999999999s)]
*  What if their parents agree to it? Should a 15-year-old be able to be? [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4745.24s)]
*  Richard F. Reilly That's a very difficult question. And I don't feel like I'm equipped [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4748.04s)]
*  to answer it. I'm not going to interfere. Aaron Ross Powell [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4753.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think this panel agrees with this is a very difficult issue. And, you know, [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4757.4s)]
*  people should be, you know- Jared [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4760.52s)]
*  What do you think about things like critical race theory? And maybe we can just use that [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4761.52s)]
*  as a way to just talk about the state of US education in general. Are we preparing our [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4768.120000000001s)]
*  children for the task at hand? And what is the task at hand maybe in your eyes and how does it [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4773.320000000001s)]
*  need to change, if at all? Richard F. Reilly [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4780.6s)]
*  I think critical race theory, as much as I understand it, is, you know, listen, we should [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4783.0s)]
*  not be hiding from people. We should be honest people about the history in this country of [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4790.52s)]
*  genocide, of racism and those things. You know, we need to be honest about that with each other. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4796.04s)]
*  Not to shame people, not to make people feel bad, not to make people feel guilty, [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4803.240000000001s)]
*  but to understand the milestones that we never want to go near again and to move forward with [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4808.92s)]
*  those things. I, you know, in turn, I don't really understand the battle over critical race theory [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4815.0s)]
*  in schools, but to the extent, if somebody would say that this has to, that that theme [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4822.12s)]
*  has to dominate all historical teaching, I would be against that. I think it's very, [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4830.44s)]
*  very important. You know, America, our country has done wonderful things in the world. We have [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4836.76s)]
*  a history of idealism. We have a history of moral authority and leadership and we have a history of [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4843.88s)]
*  doing bad things too. But I think for children, for the sake of our national unity, for the sake [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4848.360000000001s)]
*  of, you know, we need to instill children with a sense of optimism and hope and love and also a [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4854.84s)]
*  love of history. I mean, I grew up learning history and learning, you know, kind of the heroic [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4861.64s)]
*  aspects of history, which I now understand are not the only parts of history. But it's really [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4866.6s)]
*  important for children to have role models to look up to and have an optimistic view of our country [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4874.12s)]
*  and to have, understand what the shared values are. And by values, I mean aspirational values, [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4881.8s)]
*  you know, the things that our country is supposed to stand for when we are at our best. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4888.2s)]
*  For example, Robert, in the, in San Francisco, we canceled advanced placement classes because it made [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4893.24s)]
*  people feel bad. Do you think that was a good decision? No. In the name of equity? [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4899.8s)]
*  No, we should be inspiring our children towards excellence. And we should be able to, as adults, [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4904.76s)]
*  give them measures of what we mean by excellence. And, you know, that inspires kids and inspires [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4911.24s)]
*  the best out of them. And, you know, we need to, we need to have those kinds of metrics. So that [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4917.96s)]
*  doesn't make any sense to me. Then what's your view on, for example, just educational diversity [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4922.52s)]
*  and charter schools and your just position on the teachers unions? Yeah, I mean, my view is that we [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4928.28s)]
*  ought to be putting huge resources into public schools and making them the best schools in the [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4935.0s)]
*  world. And I think if we, you know, right now we're making stealth bombers for a billion dollars [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4941.4s)]
*  that cannot fly in the rain. And I think if we just cut production of a couple of those, [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4948.839999999999s)]
*  we can make all our schools the best schools in the world. Do they need competition? Do you believe [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4954.2s)]
*  in vouchers and parents getting to choose which school they go to? Because it does seem like there's [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4959.0s)]
*  not a lot of competition and that these teachers unions have a stranglehold on these schools. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4964.759999999999s)]
*  I have to look at that issue more. I mean, my inclination is that we should be putting resources [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4970.04s)]
*  into making our public schools the best schools in the world. But you said you believed in free [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4975.32s)]
*  markets. With regard to energy, why not free markets in regard to education? It has an appeal. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4979.8s)]
*  I need to look. Okay, fair enough. Yeah, let's talk about censorship. Let's talk about the media. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4987.08s)]
*  One of the things that happened during the COVID pandemic is that a lot of people grew suspicious [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4991.32s)]
*  of the mainstream media, even more suspicious than they already had been. It seemed like the [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=4997.16s)]
*  media was carrying water on certain issues. It was almost impossible for the media to take seriously [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5001.639999999999s)]
*  the idea that the virus might have come from the Wuhan lab. For example, people who put forward that [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5008.12s)]
*  I think reasonable explanation were called conspiracy theorists. The media didn't want to [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5015.08s)]
*  look into why, for example, just as an example, Fauci lifted Obama's moratorium on gain of function [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5020.5199999999995s)]
*  research. Couldn't get the media to really cover whether masking toddlers in schools did anything [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5026.44s)]
*  positive. Then when we found out that the mRNA shots didn't prevent COVID the way they said, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5035.24s)]
*  they never even really asked the CEOs of Pfizer and these other companies, when did you know this? [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5041.879999999999s)]
*  When do you know that the vaccines didn't do what you said they're going to do? I remember at Davos, [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5048.04s)]
*  you had Rebel News. It was this guerrilla media outfit that accosted Berla, the CEO of Pfizer, [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5053.0s)]
*  out on the street. They were just asking him questions that the media is supposed to ask, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5061.56s)]
*  what did you know and when did you know it with respect to whether the vaccines prevented the [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5069.08s)]
*  spread? You couldn't get the New York Times or any of the mainstream outlets to cover this at all, [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5073.56s)]
*  so it fell to this guerrilla media outfit. That's a long wind up, but Robert, what's your take on [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5078.28s)]
*  the media? Why can't we get what seems to be honest media coverage? How does this fit into [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5085.96s)]
*  your theory of regulatory capture? Who are they carrying water for and why? [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5091.88s)]
*  Well, in 2015, I wrote a book on Zymarisol and there was a documentary that came out at that [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5096.04s)]
*  time called Trace Amounts. It was a really good documentary on the mercury-based preservative [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5107.32s)]
*  that was in a lot of vaccines at that time and it's been removed from most except for the flu [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5117.56s)]
*  vaccine now. I had a very close relationship with Roger Ailes, who was the founder of Fox News. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5121.32s)]
*  I had this weird relationship because when I was 19 years old, I spent three months in a tent with [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5130.759999999999s)]
*  him in East Africa. When he started Fox News, he became like Darth Vader to me and we were [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5135.639999999999s)]
*  anesthetical on every issue, but he was a very funny guy and very clever. He was also very loyal [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5144.28s)]
*  to his friends and he would make all of the hosts of Fox News put me on. I was the only [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5152.5199999999995s)]
*  environmentalist who was going on Hannity and Bill O'Reilly and Neil Cavuto, etc. regularly, [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5158.44s)]
*  like weekly. He made them do that, but I went to him with this movie and showed it to him and he [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5163.08s)]
*  found it compelling. He had a relative who he believed was vaccine-injured, a very, very close [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5172.36s)]
*  relative. He believed what was going on and what the thrust of the documentary was. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5178.839999999999s)]
*  He said, I cannot let you talk about this on Fox News. I'm sorry. It was the first time he ever [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5187.799999999999s)]
*  saw me this. He said, if any of my hosts let you on to talk about this, I would have to fire them. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5193.16s)]
*  And he said, if I didn't fire them, I'd get a call from Rupert within 10 minutes. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5200.76s)]
*  He said to me at that time that 70% of the revenues on network news, on prime time, [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5207.64s)]
*  were pharmaceutical ads. He said of 22 ad spaces that we sell on the network news, [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5218.84s)]
*  on the evening news, 17 of those are pharmaceutical. We cannot afford to offend our biggest [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5227.88s)]
*  funder, his advertisers. I had this interesting experience with Jake Tapper [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5238.92s)]
*  where when I worked on my Rolling Stone article, Deadly Immunity, [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5245.0s)]
*  which was about this secret meeting that took place in Simpsonwood, Georgia by CDC and all of [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5249.400000000001s)]
*  the vaccine companies and FDA, et cetera, where they decided to hide the autism effect from the [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5254.6s)]
*  American people. I got the transcripts for him and published in Rolling Stone. Jake Tapper worked for [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5261.08s)]
*  21 days with me on an exclusive story. He was going to add simultaneously with [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5269.08s)]
*  Rolling Stone publishing it. Tapper, the night before it went on, he called me in total distress [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5279.32s)]
*  and he said, it's been pulled by corporate. The whole thing is gone. He said, never in my career [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5286.36s)]
*  has corporate killed one of my stories and I'm really angry. Then I called him back the next day, [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5291.88s)]
*  he's never spoken to me again. But there are consequences for these newscasters who depart [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5296.5199999999995s)]
*  from the orthodoxy. They know it. If you look at Anderson Cooper, he's got now probably a $13 [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5303.16s)]
*  million a year salary. But if you actually do the math, probably around 10 million of that comes [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5309.96s)]
*  from Pfizer, which sponsors his show. He's working for them, he's not working for us. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5317.0s)]
*  They know who they're working for. Aaron Powell [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5324.2s)]
*  is a great guy. He's got a lot of explosive stuff. I can't disagree with you as having been a [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5326.6s)]
*  publisher my whole career. There is- Why even have pharmaceutical ads on TV? Only doctors can [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5332.84s)]
*  prescribe them. It was illegal prior to 1997. There's only two nations in the world that allow [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5340.92s)]
*  pharmaceutical advertising on TV. One is New Zealand and the other is the United States. We both [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5348.76s)]
*  have huge pharmaceutical sales. We take three to four times the amount of pharmaceutical drugs as [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5354.6s)]
*  a European takes. We have the worst health results. We're 79th in terms of health outcomes [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5361.0s)]
*  among all nations. Also, pharmaceutical drugs are the third biggest killer of Americans [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5371.4800000000005s)]
*  after cancer and heart attacks. It is not helping. When FDA changed that rule, [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5377.799999999999s)]
*  the AMA was against it. All the medical institutions said, you can't do this, [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5384.839999999999s)]
*  it is going to destroy health in America. But they did it. The problem is that the [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5389.5599999999995s)]
*  pharmaceutical companies now not only have this platform for broadcasting their product, [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5396.36s)]
*  but they also control content on the media board. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5403.4800000000005s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. As far as I can tell, I think the left, [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5407.08s)]
*  just to be blunt, hates you more than the right. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5410.6s)]
*  Do you want to just comment on your ability to get the mainstream media to pay attention, [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5417.08s)]
*  particularly folks on the left, and give you the airtime so that you can get your message out? [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5422.76s)]
*  And how much the party matters in this process for you? [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5427.08s)]
*  I don't know that they're going to. I mean, it was kind of traumatic what happened this week to [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5429.56s)]
*  them. Not to me, because I'm used to it. The ABC, a person who describes herself as a journalist, [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5434.76s)]
*  journalist, and gave me a long talk when I got to ABC, that when I got to the green room, that she [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5444.4400000000005s)]
*  was not somebody who would ever censor or cut, and they're not working a cherry pick. Because I said [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5453.240000000001s)]
*  I'm very uncomfortable doing a taped interview with you. I know what you guys do when I tape an [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5458.84s)]
*  interview. You cut it up, you cherry pick it, you dice it, and then you play things out of context. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5464.12s)]
*  And she said, you won't do this. See, that's from me. I'm a journalist, journalist. I don't take [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5470.76s)]
*  orders from anybody. And then she asked me, she says, you know, in the interview, I didn't want [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5474.679999999999s)]
*  to talk about vaccines. I'm not going around the country talking about vaccines. If you see my [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5482.44s)]
*  speeches, I don't mention vaccines. But if somebody asks me about vaccines, I'm going to [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5487.64s)]
*  tell the truth. I'm not looking to talk about them. I know a lot about them, but I'm not leading with [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5492.76s)]
*  that. Because I'm interested in a lot of other issues. Oh, she says, everything you've said about [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5497.320000000001s)]
*  vaccines, about vaccines and autism has been debunked. And, you know, vaccines, it's clear, [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5505.160000000001s)]
*  do not cause autism. What do you have to say by that? And then I said, by who? And then I went [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5511.48s)]
*  into a long diatribe where I cited the cases, the dates, the publications, and the studies that show [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5519.719999999999s)]
*  that, yeah, obviously it caused autism. And she cut out that whole section. And then, and then, [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5526.5199999999995s)]
*  so she had her question, which stated the industry talking point. And then she brackets the [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5534.84s)]
*  news report on me with something at the beginning that says, you know, he's known to be a chronic [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5544.5199999999995s)]
*  liar and a disinformation spreader. And then the end she said, we had to remove things he said, [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5549.8s)]
*  because they were false. The whole thing was so weird that she has gotten criticism even from the [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5555.56s)]
*  left. Because, you know, I mean, what is the newscasters supposed to do? Are they supposed [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5561.32s)]
*  to manipulate public information? Is their job to protect Americans from dangerous thoughts? [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5566.92s)]
*  Are they audiences? Do they have such contempt for their audiences that they think that the [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5573.16s)]
*  audiences can't make up their own minds? And what is their whole vision about the traditional role [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5578.36s)]
*  of the American media as the guardians of free speech in the First Amendment in this country? [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5584.679999999999s)]
*  You can be sure our commitment to you is to not take out one sentence of anything you said. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5589.08s)]
*  There's some stuff I'd like you to take out. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5593.56s)]
*  I mean, I also found that a crazy decision for them to make. If you're, if they actually believe [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5597.96s)]
*  that what you're saying about vaccines, which they put on the table, is incorrect, or what you said [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5604.68s)]
*  about autism or COVID is incorrect, they should be trained enough to rebut it and have a thoughtful [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5610.04s)]
*  debate about you. I'll be even more blunt on this. My short takeaway about you, Robert, is that you [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5617.88s)]
*  are this odd person, which is born and raised by the establishment, but raising a lot of very [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5623.72s)]
*  uncomfortable questions about the establishment. And I think that that's very complicated for [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5632.2s)]
*  people to deal with. And I don't think that folks will be very supportive of you in the mainstream. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5636.12s)]
*  And I think the reason is because it'll cause them to question all these systems that they put a lot [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5642.12s)]
*  of trust into that they work within. And so I'm not even sure whether they're trying to play gotcha [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5647.0s)]
*  journalism about vaccines, or which is a much bigger thing, which is here is a guy that I do [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5653.56s)]
*  think it's very similar to Trump that says, he came out of the house and told us what was happening [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5658.76s)]
*  in the house. And it actually turned out that was happening the Dave Chappelle quote from Saturday [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5663.8s)]
*  Night Live. I think you're a very different person than him. But that comment is very much the same. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5667.48s)]
*  I think people are attracted to the truth and the confirmatory evidence about when they think that [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5672.36s)]
*  there's, frankly, corruption. And when it's laid bare in plain English, I think it's validating [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5677.96s)]
*  for those on the outside because we're like, we knew it. And then for folks on the inside, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5685.24s)]
*  they're like, we need to bury it. And I think that that's what you're going to be up against [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5689.16s)]
*  this entire election cycle. So whether it's us, whether it's Rogan, folks that will give you the [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5692.36s)]
*  chance for you to just lay your case out for millions of people who can smartly and intelligently [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5697.64s)]
*  make up their decision, I think that's what it comes down to. So I really just want to say thank [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5703.88s)]
*  you for giving us so much time and just being as honest as you were and transparent as you were. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5708.04s)]
*  Sax closing thoughts here with Mr. Kennedy. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5713.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with that. I mean, I think that's a great reference, Jamoth, to the Chappelle quote. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5716.12s)]
*  I think that the ABC News interview was really telling because I think it's one thing if they [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5723.0s)]
*  had edited the interview for time and just cut certain things, but they didn't do that. They [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5729.0s)]
*  cut out your side of the conversation and then declared you guilty of misinformation, but not [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5735.400000000001s)]
*  letting the audience hear what it is that you said. They simply declared you guilty of it. And I think [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5742.12s)]
*  and I think in that case, I think this is an example of how dissenting views are labeled as [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5747.400000000001s)]
*  misinformation as really a suppression tactic. They can't prove that it was misinformation. They [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5753.72s)]
*  didn't give you the chance to say your side of it. And I think this is a tactic now of the elite to [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5760.360000000001s)]
*  declare certain inconvenient truths or viewpoints out of bounds. They don't want them being considered. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5767.16s)]
*  And I think what's very interesting about your campaign is you are going to force, I think, [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5774.76s)]
*  elites and various kinds, foreign policy elites, [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5780.36s)]
*  Henderson Cooper, [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5783.96s)]
*  political elites, media elites, financial, [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5785.32s)]
*  to consider views that whether you agree with them or not, I think you've made them in a very [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5787.88s)]
*  articulate way. And I know enough about certain of your views, like with respect to the origins of [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5793.0s)]
*  the Ukraine war to say, yeah, I agree with that. I believe that's true. So I don't think they can [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5799.08s)]
*  dismiss you. Today's conspiracy theories, Sachs, as we've talked about our tomorrow's Pulitzers, [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5803.48s)]
*  today's conspiracy theories are tomorrow's Pulitzers. Go ahead, Jamal. I really think that [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5808.759999999999s)]
*  this is what's going to be scary as if you're as this election kind of rolls forward, the contrast [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5812.759999999999s)]
*  and compare on the democratic side is going to be very troublesome to the establishment. And I just [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5818.839999999999s)]
*  encourage you to just just keep sticking to it and telling people what you think. Freberg, any final [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5824.28s)]
*  thoughts as we wrap? Can I say one last thing? Yes, of course. And I want to, because this is [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5830.44s)]
*  such a great platform. What I've always said to people, you know, if I'm promoting misinformation, [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5836.44s)]
*  which I'm constantly accused of, show me what it is. Identify, don't just say I'm an [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5843.48s)]
*  misinformation promoter. Show me the piece that you don't agree with or that, you know, I made a [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5850.04s)]
*  false statement. I would say that I have not promoted any misinformation. Unless misinformation [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5855.64s)]
*  is just a euphemism for anything that departs from government orthodoxies. Every post, I have probably [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5863.56s)]
*  the most robust fact checking operation in North America because I know these attacks are coming. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5870.52s)]
*  So we have 300 and over 320 MD physicians, PhD scientists on my advisory board who see everything [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5876.68s)]
*  that goes out. And everything that I posted on Instagram was cited or sourced for to a government [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5883.96s)]
*  database or peer reviewed publication. I don't want anything. And by the way, that doesn't mean [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5890.44s)]
*  I won't make a mistake at some point. But guess what? If I made a mistake, people would point it [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5896.12s)]
*  out. And you know what I would do? I change it and apologize. You change your opinion in the face of new facts? [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5901.96s)]
*  Exactly. Show me facts. That's the only thing that'll change my opinion. Show me facts. And [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5907.4800000000005s)]
*  I will change it so fast. But you know, you need to show me facts. So just on on the competition [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5913.8s)]
*  between you and Biden for this nomination, I want to say that the Kennedy family has been involved [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5919.72s)]
*  in public life for for decades and many Kennedys has served in public life. And I honestly don't [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5924.84s)]
*  remember one time with any Kennedy who served in public life where they've been accused of receiving [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5931.24s)]
*  money from a foreign government, not once. And we're now up to 12 Bidens, I think, who've received [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5939.16s)]
*  a payment, you know, from foreign governments, potentially in this larger Hunter Biden scandal. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5945.72s)]
*  Do you have a point of view on that? I mean, the fact that it appears that Hunter Biden and other [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5951.5599999999995s)]
*  members of the Biden family receive payments from foreign governments. Is that how do you interpret [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5957.88s)]
*  that? Is that something that you think is fair game in this campaign to talk about? [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5962.599999999999s)]
*  I you know, I don't know enough about it, David, to be able to render judgment on it. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5967.32s)]
*  I don't know the intricacies of those relationships. I think the optics are unfortunate. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5974.28s)]
*  But, you know, I would leave it I think it is fair game for people who are looking into it to [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5981.8s)]
*  criticize and question it. I don't know enough about I'm not in the position to be able to do that. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5987.64s)]
*  All right. On that, I would just like to say I grew up in a Catholic household, Irish Catholic [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=5992.92s)]
*  in Brooklyn, on the wall in my grandmother and grandfather's dining room, were three people, [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6000.12s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Jesus Christ. It's been an honor to have you on the program. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6007.56s)]
*  And thank you for giving us two hours of vibrant debate. We wish you well. And we'd like to have [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6012.2s)]
*  you on again. And perhaps if this platform allows for debates, and they will not host you on the [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6016.92s)]
*  debates, we will here on the all in podcasts, I'll let you go. And on behalf of all the besties, [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6022.76s)]
*  thank you for giving us two hours and deeply engaging on these topics. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6029.320000000001s)]
*  Fantastic. Thank you. I really enjoyed it. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6034.12s)]
*  All right, this I think went spectacularly well. Let's go around the horn here and get [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6037.64s)]
*  immediate reactions. Friedberg, I want to start with you because I think you on the science issues [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6042.2s)]
*  maybe held back a little bit and let him speak. We didn't have much of a dialogue with him. I'd [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6048.68s)]
*  say we all kind of had a few opening statements, but let him kind of speak his mind. I don't know, [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6053.240000000001s)]
*  we'll see how the episode plays with listeners. It was really him having a platform to speak his [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6059.4800000000005s)]
*  mind for the past two hours. And it's interesting. I mean, obviously he's a candidate that's [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6066.52s)]
*  challenging the current sitting president for his own party's nomination. So really kind of [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6071.96s)]
*  interesting moment to participate in. But we did kind of give him the platform to kind of speak [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6079.64s)]
*  his mind. I think my observation is this guy, Robert clearly has a very deep rooted anti-establishment [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6084.52s)]
*  energy and that plays through in many of his points of view. Anti-establishment kind of [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6092.76s)]
*  energy I think manifests as both conspiracy theories [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6102.84s)]
*  where as people have kind of classified some of his claims, which typically involves looking at, [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6106.360000000001s)]
*  call it correlation or circumstance, but not necessarily having the causality or the tie [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6114.12s)]
*  to demonstrate or have proof of point or evidence of point. And I think that that's really where [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6119.96s)]
*  he trips me up on a couple of points personally. Which ones would you say are the points that trip [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6126.76s)]
*  you up most? Where were you like? I think the general statement that there are kind of, [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6131.48s)]
*  you know, embedded interests in government is a good general statement. Then you start to try [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6137.32s)]
*  and tie together different kind of correlations or circumstances and say that's evidence. It's not [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6143.16s)]
*  really, it doesn't resonate true with me as someone who likes to kind of see empirical truth kind of [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6148.44s)]
*  be demonstrated. I think some of these points around, we know that PFOA is one of these products, [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6155.08s)]
*  one of these chemistries he talked about that's in the environment. They're very damaging to the [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6160.6s)]
*  environment. They're very damaging to human health. And there are others that he makes claims around [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6164.280000000001s)]
*  that don't have that same level of evidence, but they all get kind of bucketed together that [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6167.88s)]
*  all this stuff is bad, that all nuclear is bad because there is a facility that was built in the [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6171.4800000000005s)]
*  1950s and 1960s that had some degree of bad engineering. And what some might argue isn't [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6178.4400000000005s)]
*  necessarily a major hazardous radioactive leak, but has above kind of standards of radiation leak. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6184.200000000001s)]
*  And therefore all nuclear is threatening. Those are the sorts of things that kind of trip me up [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6189.8s)]
*  with him. That one can help a little bit as well. The nuclear issue. The thing that matters to me, [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6193.400000000001s)]
*  this is all just bullshit talking, rambling about social issues and you know, like what the fuck are [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6199.24s)]
*  we going to do with education and wars? None of it fucking matters. If we cannot solve the debt and [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6203.96s)]
*  budget crisis problem in this country, we are running into the ground. The United States is [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6210.360000000001s)]
*  totally disagreeing. I know you do. And I think the U S is in a tight moment. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6216.76s)]
*  Your key issue. So for me, this is the thing that I told you guys I'm focused on with every candidate [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6222.04s)]
*  is how much do you think about the prioritization of the fiscal, the federal budget? How do you think [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6227.24s)]
*  about the debt level and how do you think about the boundary conditions? And it's clear that that's [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6232.68s)]
*  not really a concrete part of his platform, nor is it by the way, for any other candidate that I've [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6236.6s)]
*  seen so far. That's kind of where I sit. And it's very unpopular. Chamath, let's have [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6241.400000000001s)]
*  your response here too. I think it's good to have your opinion. I just think that your opinion is [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6246.68s)]
*  an opinion and you presented as this canonical fact. And that's what I have an issue with. I [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6250.92s)]
*  just think that's intellectually not accurate. So I respect the fact that you think that that's an [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6255.8s)]
*  issue, but I think there's a lot of smart people that would say that's not the issue that you think [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6260.4400000000005s)]
*  it is. And there are other issues. Where did you find yourself Chamath in this process, [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6265.64s)]
*  agreeing with him or disagreeing with him? All political candidates at some point have a fork [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6271.08s)]
*  in the road, which is that they're going to be a truth teller of their own truth, [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6277.5599999999995s)]
*  or they're going to be conformist to talking points to try to offend the least amount of people. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6284.84s)]
*  Okay. And the first path is much riskier, but it actually has much larger discontinuous [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6292.2s)]
*  outcomes, i.e. Trump. The other path is a good antidote to the first path, [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6299.96s)]
*  when the first path is what's in power and you saw Biden take that path. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6307.96s)]
*  So for me, I don't agree with some of the things that he said. In fact, there are things like [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6312.76s)]
*  nuclear, which I just think he's wrong about. Sure. But what do I appreciate is that there is [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6318.2s)]
*  a version of his truth that is researched and reasoned from his own lived experience, [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6325.0s)]
*  as well as history and facts. And then he's also willing to say, I just don't know enough about it, [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6332.92s)]
*  so let me rethink it and then come back to you. I thought the comment about school choice was an [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6337.96s)]
*  example. Right? And I think that that's healthy. So on balance, I would rather have candidates in [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6342.92s)]
*  that first bucket, which are truth tellers that have the potential to cause disagreement [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6350.28s)]
*  versus the placators who say nothing. And this is where I do agree with Freeberg, [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6357.4s)]
*  whatever the issues are that may be important, the point is placating doesn't work anymore. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6363.16s)]
*  And you need some kind of confrontation on hard topics for there to be any progress now. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6369.4s)]
*  And so I prefer those kinds of people that are able to draw a hard line, agitators, [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6377.160000000001s)]
*  non conformance personally, I'm so I've always been and I have been very anti establishment, [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6383.88s)]
*  the idea of tearing down all these institutions of power gives me glee. I find it gleeful. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6389.8s)]
*  Sax, when we look at this, this incredible, you know, almost two hour conversation we had here, [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6396.200000000001s)]
*  I think we did hold him and force him on certain issues more than you would normally get in an [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6401.72s)]
*  interview without being sensational. We didn't lead with vaccines. We didn't lead with culture [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6407.320000000001s)]
*  wars. We talked about really important issues. Where did you find yourself in most agreement with [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6412.360000000001s)]
*  him? And where did you find yourself in least agreement with him? Well, I want to make sure [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6417.16s)]
*  we see the forest for the trees here because I think you can disagree with this or that tree, [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6421.16s)]
*  or you can get lost down the rabbit hole of some of these very technical scientific debates. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6425.400000000001s)]
*  But here's the forest is you've got this scion of wealth and privilege who comes from the most [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6430.36s)]
*  prominent, famous democratic family. And he was set in his life to go become an environmental [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6437.24s)]
*  lawyer who go fight against big corporate environmental polluters. And somewhere along [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6442.759999999999s)]
*  the way he realized it wasn't just big corporations was the problem. It was the agencies, the government [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6448.2s)]
*  agencies that were supposed to be regulating them. And he realized that there was a revolving door [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6453.5599999999995s)]
*  going on between industry and these agencies. And so he ended up litigating not just against big [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6457.8s)]
*  companies, but against government agencies. I think that's a really interesting place for a [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6463.4800000000005s)]
*  candidate to come from. And what you heard him say, or what I took away from it is that he has a very [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6469.16s)]
*  sophisticated critique of regulatory capture. And it goes beyond just the environmental area, [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6475.64s)]
*  it goes also to big pharma, and it goes to the military industrial complex. When he's talking [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6481.88s)]
*  about all these unnecessary wars that the United States has gotten into, and who can doubt that [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6486.76s)]
*  after we spent 20 years and $8 trillion bogged down in forever wars in the Middle East, who can doubt [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6492.52s)]
*  that the military industrial complex has played a malign role in our foreign policy. And we've got [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6499.400000000001s)]
*  all these generals when they retire from the Pentagon, they go right onto the boards, [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6506.360000000001s)]
*  these defense contractors. So there's enough right about his critique that I think you can't dismiss [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6509.8s)]
*  it. You can't just say this guy's a conspiracy theorist or a nut. He's saying too many things [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6515.64s)]
*  that I know would be true. And there's a lot of other areas where I don't know what the truth is, [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6520.76s)]
*  but he is making, I'd say sensible arguments, he's presenting data, and he's asking you to [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6525.72s)]
*  challenge him on the data. So in any event, I think he's got this very interesting critique [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6530.76s)]
*  of regulatory capture. What he's basically saying is that we have a ruling elite in this country [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6536.04s)]
*  that is managing the country for its own benefit, and that is screwing the middle class. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6541.96s)]
*  And that critique actually is very similar to what Trump and DeSantis and people on the right [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6546.44s)]
*  are saying. The only difference is that I think people on the right are blaming ideology. They're [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6551.4800000000005s)]
*  saying that the ruling elite is following this woke ideology. What Kennedy is saying is that the [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6556.12s)]
*  ruling class is following the money. But you know what? They could both be right. I think these [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6561.56s)]
*  critiques are very compatible. So look, you might disagree with this or that part of it, but I [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6566.36s)]
*  think that this overall critique, the forest, forget about the trees, I think this forest could [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6571.72s)]
*  find purchase with the electorate. Because I think people just feel like there's something true about [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6577.64s)]
*  this. What I will say is this is exactly how Trump got elected. And there was a great piece, [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6583.16s)]
*  I think it was in the Atlantic when he was running the first time around, that talked a lot about the [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6587.56s)]
*  psychology of his appeal, that he comes from wealth, he comes from the system, but he is the [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6593.08s)]
*  anti-system system product, that he came out of this machine of wealth, this machine of industry, [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6599.8s)]
*  this machine of influence. And he said, this entire system needs to be torn down. And it's, [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6606.84s)]
*  by the way, the psychology that they highlighted, and it speaks to Trump, not necessarily to Robert, [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6612.2s)]
*  but what they highlighted was if you look historically at the rise of authoritarian regimes [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6617.24s)]
*  coming out of democracies, it's typically the folks that are come from an influence of, [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6622.76s)]
*  from a point of influence, and from the point of privilege and power, and they then decided they [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6627.16s)]
*  wanted to tear down the system that produced them. And you trust the bully that comes out of the [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6632.12s)]
*  machine versus the outsider who doesn't really know the machine and doesn't really have access. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6637.48s)]
*  And that's partially why I think maybe he has a shot at being the anti-Biden alternative, [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6641.72s)]
*  more so perhaps in this go around than Trump is. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6648.12s)]
*  Look, he's not a bully, and he's not going to tear everything down. Listen, and I've heard him on [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6650.68s)]
*  other interviews, and what he said is we need a peaceful revolution. We need to reorganize these [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6656.28s)]
*  government agencies. So he's not saying- So maybe that's why he does win over Trump, [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6660.44s)]
*  right? Maybe he becomes the less extreme. He's not the bully, but he's like, I know how to dismantle [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6665.0s)]
*  and rebuild these systems. His ideals are quite, they're incredible. Free speech, supporting the [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6669.24s)]
*  rule of law, burgeoning the middle class. I mean, these are not things that are really controversial [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6675.16s)]
*  in the end. They're good morals, right? They're good values. They're good morals. He's very [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6681.0s)]
*  morally grounded. I think my concern is just the framework for how you rationalize and make decisions [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6684.2s)]
*  if you're allowing influence innuendo and correlation be the driving force instead of having- [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6691.24s)]
*  Make sure you just at least gather and sort the empirical evidence to make those decisions. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6699.72s)]
*  That's what he's doing. He just reached a different conclusion than you. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6704.84s)]
*  Yeah, exactly, because he's saying that the other conclusion is just the orthodox conclusion, [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6707.5599999999995s)]
*  which is nothing to see here. Yeah, by the way, I'm not an orthodox guy and I'm not following [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6711.8s)]
*  folks. Saxa, folks have said you're pushing RFK because you think he's a weaker candidate [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6717.64s)]
*  against the Republicans, your response. No, I don't necessarily think he'd be a [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6724.92s)]
*  weaker candidate for all the reasons we're talking about. I think he'd be preferable to Biden in a [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6729.400000000001s)]
*  lot of people's views. So look, for me, this is not like partisan. I just think he's really [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6733.4800000000005s)]
*  interesting. I think he is a breath of fresh air. I think there are many aspects of his critique [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6739.4s)]
*  of our system and the corruption of our ruling class that hit home. I think regulatory capture [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6745.08s)]
*  is a huge issue. I think a lot of these agencies do need to be reorganized. Well, it is the invisible [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6751.08s)]
*  hand that we don't know how to quantify well in all these other discussions that we have. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6755.16s)]
*  He does put his finger on this really ugly, uncomfortable truth, which is there's a cloistered [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6760.12s)]
*  set of insiders for which there's a revolving door between power and money. And it's going to [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6764.76s)]
*  be very awkward for a small number of people to hear that message as he gets more attention, [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6771.0s)]
*  which is probably why the media industrial complex will not, you know, will do his best to prevent [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6775.96s)]
*  that message from getting out. The media is going to block this guy at every angle because when you [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6782.52s)]
*  said- But you know what? Podcasts could play a huge role. Just like in 2016, social media broke [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6788.12s)]
*  through and played a huge role. I think in 2024, I think that podcast could break through- Podcasts [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6791.96s)]
*  will decide the election. And be the way that unorthodox candidates get their message out. It [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6797.08s)]
*  could be really interesting. It could be the way all candidates get their message out because if [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6801.16s)]
*  after two hours of this, you don't want to learn more about him or you're not going to consider him [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6803.64s)]
*  more fully, I think it's impossible because he's so well-spoken. As you said, he's got a moral [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6808.44s)]
*  compass. He's got a track record. And he's got interesting thoughts. And he's got interesting [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6813.0s)]
*  thoughts. What he isn't saying is he's not just throwing bombs. And there may be things that you [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6816.12s)]
*  can debate with him about his interpretation of what he looks at, you know, and that's very fair [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6823.0s)]
*  criticism, I think. But his critique is well reasoned. And so you have to unpack the nuances [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6829.16s)]
*  of it to understand why he got to it and also to try to prove him wrong. That is very powerful [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6834.44s)]
*  because it's not just him randomly screaming about how things aren't working. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6839.72s)]
*  No, and I the moments I thought were very important here, and especially for the listeners [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6845.08s)]
*  who are listening, who are making important decisions and want to maybe change the political [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6850.360000000001s)]
*  system. There were multiple times on the issue of trans surgery, and I'm going to be very nuanced [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6853.8s)]
*  here, with the permission of the parents, he said, I need to do more research on it on free [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6858.84s)]
*  bird challenging him about spending, spending, he said, I need to, I need to give that some more [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6863.08s)]
*  thought. But broadly speaking, you know, I think we can take money out of the military budget and [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6868.36s)]
*  billion dollar planes that don't fly in the rain. There were many moments where he conceded, I need [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6872.28s)]
*  to give that some more thought, I need to be thoughtful about that. That's not something that [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6876.599999999999s)]
*  you typically hear. But in a platform like this, with, you know, the nuance that we've created [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6881.16s)]
*  on this platform, having discussions, and the audience also being nuanced and having depth, [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6887.88s)]
*  we know the fans of this podcast are in a lot of positions of power, I'm sure 100% or [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6893.4s)]
*  very high percentage of the people who listen to this podcast actually vote, and are very [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6898.36s)]
*  influential within their own circles. I think this kind of platform, we have a very deep discussion [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6902.679999999999s)]
*  and somebody can say, you know what, I need to go deeper on that and think about it. When I asked [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6907.799999999999s)]
*  him about weapons in Taiwan, and then I said, Hey, why wouldn't you give an answer that you defend [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6911.5599999999995s)]
*  Taiwan, Biden gave it. So I don't want to tip my card, you wouldn't want to do that. That's a [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6916.679999999999s)]
*  really good answer. By the way, the official the official policy of the United States towards [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6920.12s)]
*  Taiwan is strategic ambiguity, which means we don't say whether we'll defend it, it depends [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6924.36s)]
*  on the circumstances. And Biden, when he's now said multiple times that he would defend it, [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6928.599999999999s)]
*  and his own staff walked it back, because they said, we're not changing strategic ambiguity. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6933.639999999999s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, the policy he said in that case actually is the United States policy. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6938.12s)]
*  So let me ask you guys a question. If he won the Democratic nomination, [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6943.32s)]
*  and he's up against Trump, who do you vote for? Obviously, [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6948.679999999999s)]
*  RFK. Yeah, of course, RFK. And I think Sachs would have a hard time, he won't say who he's [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6951.96s)]
*  voted for previously. I think Sachs would vote. Sachs is not going to say, are you? Are you gonna [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6957.24s)]
*  say no? Sachs doesn't like to say he's just Machiavellian. I'm reserving judgment on the [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6961.4800000000005s)]
*  general until I know who both candidates are. Okay, he won't even Sachs won't even tell us who [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6965.96s)]
*  who he voted for. I would love for RFK Jr. to be on the ballot and have that choice, for sure. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6969.88s)]
*  And it's possible I would is possible I would vote for him. It depends who the other person [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6976.04s)]
*  is. Really, because you won't even tell us who you voted for, or if you voted in the last election. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6980.12s)]
*  Well, that's my right, Jason, I don't have to tell you. I just think it's intellectually [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6984.2s)]
*  dishonest since you talk about politics so much that I do I think you should tell us who you vote. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6988.44s)]
*  I talk about issues, I decide to balance those issues, because every candidate is a complex [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6994.2s)]
*  mix of issues. That's ultimately my decision. Yeah, but for somebody who injects into everything [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=6999.72s)]
*  to not just say I'm not the one injecting. So to follow up on the question I asked, [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7005.4s)]
*  I would love to see Donald Trump come on the show, and give him an opportunity to have a [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7011.08s)]
*  conversation and see if folks can have a different point of view coming out of that, as well as [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7015.24s)]
*  Joe Biden, and maybe some of the other candidates running for the Republican nomination. And I want [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7021.24s)]
*  to see if the the points of focus for us can, you know, maybe match up with one or more of these [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7026.44s)]
*  candidates. So far, I'm still- Well, Nikki Haley will come on, right? [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7035.32s)]
*  Really? Yeah. So Nikki Haley's in, and then Trump will do it. And then Biden will not. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7039.5599999999995s)]
*  Trump will do it. I think Trump will do it because he somebody would, I mean, he had he did something [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7045.08s)]
*  with Bart's tool, right? Jason, do you want to do you want me to do the announcement on the [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7049.719999999999s)]
*  summit? Oh, please. Okay, so we are confirmed and signed on our venue. And so we are confirmed [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7054.4400000000005s)]
*  for All In Summit 2023 in Los Angeles, September 10 through 12. Secure the bag, baby, let's go. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7065.88s)]
*  We'll put out the- and I think it's going to be really exciting because we'll have an opportunity [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7075.0s)]
*  at this point in the year, we have a lot of time to put together a really high quality [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7080.679999999999s)]
*  agenda for conversations we each want to have with really amazing people. So I'm excited about [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7085.879999999999s)]
*  that. We've kind of started to put together some ideas on what we want to talk about, who we want [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7091.08s)]
*  to invite to have those conversations with us put out some invites. So very good job, by the way. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7095.24s)]
*  And you'll be leading your lead. This is your AI summit. So I'm handing everything off to you. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7099.08s)]
*  I'm helping with the parties basically, but you're driving. Congratulations. Your team is [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7104.28s)]
*  exceptional. I just want to let the audience know- We're doing it together. And it's going to [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7108.2s)]
*  be great. I'm stepping back and letting you drive. I consider this like your- I care very deeply about [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7112.28s)]
*  content and I want to make sure that we get a chance to have- An experience. Yeah, an experience [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7117.639999999999s)]
*  and have a chance to have the conversations we want to have with the folks we want to talk with. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7121.08s)]
*  Nothing can be better than you building on top of the first one. And then we just keep going from [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7125.5599999999995s)]
*  there, Chamath and Saxe, if they want to build on it from there. There'll be three- this is what [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7129.08s)]
*  everybody wants to know is tickets. There's going to be three ticket tiers. There'll still be a VIP [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7132.84s)]
*  one for 7,500 that gets you into the dinners. Oh, sorry. Yeah. That's an important point. The VIP [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7136.04s)]
*  experience this year, we got some feedback on the last go-around that we needed to make sure there [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7140.84s)]
*  was a degree of differentiation. So the VIP experience will include special VIP dinners, [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7145.24s)]
*  early access to the theater, gift bags, special sections during the parties. So hopefully it [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7150.44s)]
*  elevates the experience a bit for folks that are able to pay the higher ticket fee, which actually [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7156.28s)]
*  helps support the whole program. No bottle service. I mean, bottle service if you bring your card. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7160.76s)]
*  But hopefully as a way to kind of support the overall program and keep the cost down for [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7165.24s)]
*  everyone else. And then it's a $1,500 general admission pass, which includes access to the [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7168.52s)]
*  parties. And then we'll still have the scholarship class. Can I tell you guys a funny story? Yeah. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7172.84s)]
*  When I joined the ownership group that bought the Warriors, I heard a rumor, which was that when we [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7177.4800000000005s)]
*  were competing, it was us versus Ellison to buy the Warriors. And Ellison had an idea, I don't know [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7182.68s)]
*  if this is true or not. This is what I had heard that he had a, he had an idea for a new stadium [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7189.72s)]
*  and he's like, he wanted to make it an ultra VIP stadium. And so there's only 5,000 seats. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7194.76s)]
*  And they all were like Singapore Airlines first class seats. So you go to the stadium to watch [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7200.76s)]
*  TV, but it'd be like, everybody would be like up close and you could touch. And outside they also [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7206.68s)]
*  had a thousand guillotines. So you could just, yeah. I mean, it's hard enough for a family to [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7211.08s)]
*  go see. I don't know if that's true or not, but I thought it was very funny. Crazy expensive now. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7216.44s)]
*  It's like crazy. Hundreds of dollars for no split seats for the dictator Tramoff Polyhapitiya [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7221.0s)]
*  for David Sachs who set up this episode and Friedberg, the Sultan of science. We hope you [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7227.799999999999s)]
*  enjoy this. It's the first of many to come. We will still be doing regular dockets. We might [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7234.2s)]
*  have to go to two episodes a week on weeks like this. Who knows, but give us your feedback, [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7238.28s)]
*  share the show and we'll see you all at the all in summit. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7243.0s)]
*  We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just like this, [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7273.0s)]
*  like sexual tension, but they just need to release them out. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=7283.16s)]
