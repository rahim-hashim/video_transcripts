# E123 Trump indictment, de-dollarization, should VCs back Chinese AI? RIP Bob Lee
**All In Podcast:** [April 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8)
*  I can't see what's on your hat. What does it say? Super gut? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=0.0s)]
*  One of my most exciting companies called Ohalo. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2.64s)]
*  Oh, Mahalo. I still have Mahalo.com. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  No, not Mahalo. Unrelated, completely unrelated, nothing whatsoever to do with Mahalo. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=7.44s)]
*  I remember Mahalo. Great product. Sorry, it didn't become like it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=11.84s)]
*  Going up against, you know, we were making $10 million in revenue at the peak. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=16.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=20.8s)]
*  And a hundred people writing like human curated search result pages. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=21.44s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=25.92s)]
*  Look at Chachi. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=26.8s)]
*  You're a great guy to reference the Chachi PT thing coming out of that. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, then what happened was they did the Panda update and we went from 10 million down to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=32.24s)]
*  500,000 in revenue overnight. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=37.52s)]
*  What was the Panda update? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=39.44s)]
*  They looked at who the top sites were, eHow, Mahalo, et cetera. And they just said, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=40.8s)]
*  nobody can get any more than this amount of traffic. And they literally throttled the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=47.52s)]
*  number of unique users they would send to you. And that was it. Game over. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=51.6s)]
*  And then everybody I knew at Google wouldn't return my emails. And they were like, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=56.96s)]
*  we don't have partnerships with anybody. That's what Matt Cutts told me. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  Are you saying that Mahalo's lack of success had nothing to do with the poor product and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=64.80000000000001s)]
*  execution? It was Google's malfeasance? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=69.68s)]
*  It got really rave reviews. It was backed by Sequoia. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  So did the movie, but it sucked. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=74.48s)]
*  You know, when you build a company that gets to 10 million in revenue in 18 months, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  you can talk to him. But basically looking at your resume here, I see that you've created [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=80.8s)]
*  nothing in your entire career. When you get in the arena, the arena, and you actually build [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=84.48s)]
*  a product, then you can talk to me. I had the number one blog in the world, one of the top [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=91.2s)]
*  five tech magazines in the world. And this is the number one tech and business podcast. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=95.2s)]
*  So good. I touched a soft spot. I got to the warm underbelly there. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=98.88s)]
*  Jake Howell so rarely goes after Chamath when he does. It's just gold. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=102.96s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=107.28s)]
*  You're talking to three founders here, Chamath. You're the odd person out. So when you want to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=108.08s)]
*  talk about product, then make one. Okay, so gross. And yet I'm the richest. It's so tilting. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=112.48s)]
*  It must tilt you. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=118.16s)]
*  Totally fine. So Kim Jong Un. So Putin. Okay, there's a lot of rich people in the world. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=119.12s)]
*  But these are three product. Okay, dictator. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=124.32s)]
*  There's your cold open. Let's go. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=127.84s)]
*  All right, let's get started, everybody. It's been a big week. There's a lot to talk about. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=138.08s)]
*  Might be a little bit of a controversial spicy agenda today here on the All In podcast with me [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=150.24s)]
*  again. The Sultan of Science, who is tearing up the YouTube comments, everybody asking the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=156.4s)]
*  Sultan of Silence to contribute more and to speak more. But when he does speak, my lord, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  he drops those knowledge bombs. How you doing Sultan of Science? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=167.04s)]
*  I'm hanging in there. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=170.0s)]
*  You're hanging in there. Okay, well, I'm hanging in there. Man, a few words, I guess. Hanging in [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=171.2s)]
*  there. Okay, great. With us again, of course, another Android, David Sachs. Sachs, how are [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=175.76s)]
*  you doing? I am doing fine. How are you? Wait, let me ask GPT. What's the question? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=181.44s)]
*  How are you doing? Let me ask it. Hold on. Let me see what it says. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=188.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean, basically, chat GPT-4 is the ultimate Asperger's equalizer. You guys are going to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=191.52s)]
*  benefit most from this. I asked it, how are you? It says, as an AI language model, I don't have [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=197.12s)]
*  feelings or consciousness, so I don't experience emotions or states of being like a human does. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  However, I'm here and ready to help you with any questions or topics you'd like to discuss. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  How can I assist you today? That's pretty similar to how you feel, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  except you don't offer to help anybody. Okay, also with us is the dictator himself. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=214.24s)]
*  Talk about topics. Looking forward to today's episode. And with us, the dictator with a [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=219.84s)]
*  shockingly, shockingly low cut. There's only one button on the shirt. Only one button. Okay, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=225.2s)]
*  made from a tiny albino baby. Like right here, they were like, should we put buttons in there? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=230.96s)]
*  Like, why put buttons? Why put buttons? And then conservation movement. Exactly. No, no, no, no, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=236.4s)]
*  the one button is what counts. That is a baby albino rhinoceros that was killed, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=242.96s)]
*  vented chamoth on his vacation and then attached to his linen shirt. I guess let's just get this [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=248.0s)]
*  out of the way. Trump was a arraigned, I guess is the term he was charged in New York with 34 [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=253.6s)]
*  felony counts of falsifying business records. Alvin Bragg alleged Trump orchestrated a catching [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=260.32s)]
*  kill scheme as well to suppress damaging information before the 2016 election. Of course, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=265.28s)]
*  Trump pleaded not guilty and did a feisty press conference or speech rally at Mar-a-Lago. After [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=271.6s)]
*  that, prosecutors say the scheme involved falsifying business records to conceal payments [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=278.96000000000004s)]
*  to Stormy Daniels. We know all that. Same thing Michael Cohen went to jail for the indictment [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  wasn't a speaking indictment, where it explained all the details. So Alvin Bragg hasn't tipped his [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  cards by explaining in detail what the legal theories are and which information he has. And [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=293.20000000000005s)]
*  he was pretty clear about that, that he was not going to tip his cards, which makes us even more [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=297.44s)]
*  hard to understand what's going on and creates even more divisiveness. Predictably, the right is [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=302.0s)]
*  framing this as a witch hunt. But surprisingly, many on the left, including former SDNY head Preet [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=306.88s)]
*  Bharara of the amazing podcast Stay Tuned with Preet, which I love. He felt this was the weakest [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=311.92s)]
*  of the four major investigations that Trump is under. And he expressed some concerns on his [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  podcast that it was light and not detailed. And he might have not actually pursued this, unless he [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=323.20000000000005s)]
*  had a 99% or something like that chance because it is the president's sacks, I guess everybody's [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=331.2s)]
*  expecting us to fight over this, but to just be a little preemptive here. As much as I think Trump [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=337.12s)]
*  is like the most unethical person to ever hold the office. This does seem a little light. And I'm [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=342.56s)]
*  hoping Bragg has the goods on him because why bring a Mr. Meena case? You know, these are all I guess, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  misdemeanors that are being elevated to felonies because of tax evasion possibly or election [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=357.04s)]
*  interference. So what are you, steel man or just generally speak about the case here? Because I [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=362.32s)]
*  know that you're a man of law and order. Well, many people on the left are criticizing this case. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=368.88s)]
*  Jonathan Chait, who's a liberal writer for the New York Magazine, wrote a good column about it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=374.24s)]
*  And look, here are the reasons why. Number one, the underlying behavior here is that [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=379.76s)]
*  Trump engaged in a private settlement with Stormy Daniels. That's not illegal. Even if it is, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  you know, so-called hush money, that is legal. You're allowed to do that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=390.08000000000004s)]
*  Number two is that he used personal funds to do it. He did not use campaign funds. And this is why [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=394.72s)]
*  Alvin Bragg has had to make this kind of distorted, ridiculous claim that he should have used campaign [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=402.08000000000004s)]
*  funds to do it. But does anyone believe that if Trump had used campaign funds, that wouldn't be [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=407.76s)]
*  alleged as the crime? So he's kind of damned if he does, damned if he doesn't here. I think that, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=414.8s)]
*  you know, what the law is trying to do with these rules around campaign funds is protect donors [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  from candidates misappropriating them. And Trump had every right to use personal funds to engage [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  in the settlement. It's a major distortion of campaign finance rules. Third, these campaign [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=428.96s)]
*  finance rules are federal laws. They're not state laws. So it's not up to Alvin Bragg to [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=434.8s)]
*  enforce them. And in fact, the feds looked at this and decided not to prosecute it, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=440.32s)]
*  because if they did, they'd have to enforce similar laws against Hillary Clinton. Recall [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=445.52000000000004s)]
*  that Hillary Clinton had a problem where she used campaign funds to fund the payment to Christopher [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=451.04s)]
*  Steele to write the Steele dossier. And that was a real problem, and it was miscategorized as legal [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=457.68s)]
*  fees. And she had to pay a fine for that, but no one talked about locking her up over it. No one [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=463.2s)]
*  was talking about, you know, indicting her and sending her to jail. And so part of the reason why [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=467.44s)]
*  I think the feds didn't want to look at this is because they'd have to look at similar cases that [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=472.24s)]
*  are even more egregious. And then finally, the last thing is that we're well past the statute of [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  limitations on this whole matter. So Alvin Bragg is really out here on a limb. He's passed the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  statute of limitations. He's enforcing laws that are not his business to enforce. They're distorted [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=487.52s)]
*  interpretations of those laws. And the underlying conduct here is fully legal. So I think everybody [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=492.4s)]
*  is kind of like wondering why he's doing this. And I think there's two theories. Either Alvin Bragg [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=497.91999999999996s)]
*  is incredibly stupid, which he's not, or he's incredibly smart. Yeah. And the sort of three [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=502.64s)]
*  dimensional chess explanation that Ann Coulter has is that this is all a giant honeypot for [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=507.03999999999996s)]
*  Republicans because they're all rallying around Trump here because they perceive, I think correctly, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=512.56s)]
*  that he's being railroaded and he's being, he is the victim of a political prosecution. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=517.92s)]
*  But in rallying around him to defend him, you see that Trump's poll ratings among Republicans in the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=522.3199999999999s)]
*  primary are going through the roof. DeSantis are going down. And so what Ann Coulter fears is that [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=526.7199999999999s)]
*  this is all an elaborate ruse to make Trump the nominee because Biden would much rather face a [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=532.64s)]
*  reelection against Trump than against a young, youthful, vigorous governor like a DeSantis. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=539.1999999999999s)]
*  Do you think Bragg has a bunch of more information and maybe that tax evasion is the issue he'll go [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=544.64s)]
*  after? Because that seems to be the other theory here is he's not going to do the federal, you know, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=549.6s)]
*  election stuff. He's going to go after the tax evasion, which is what they already got [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=555.84s)]
*  the Trump organization on when Weisel, I guess the CFO is going to jail for six months. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=559.68s)]
*  It's going to be hard to connect the dots on these things. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=563.52s)]
*  And they did $1.6 million fine for that company. Good job, mom. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=564.3199999999999s)]
*  These are misdemeanor crimes. And to convert them to a felony, the crime needs to have been done [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=567.36s)]
*  in the process of aiding and abetting another crime. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=574.08s)]
*  And tax evasion is the concept here. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=577.36s)]
*  When he listed the bullet point list of all of the reasons that are all of his evidence, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=580.88s)]
*  it seemed to point to what David said, which was just these campaign finance violations. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=587.04s)]
*  This whole thing just seems like such an enormous waste of time. Just think about [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=591.92s)]
*  the amount of money that will have to be spent on just securing New York City every time he shows up [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=597.84s)]
*  the five car motorcades, the Secret Service, the police, the this, the that, the disruption to [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=606.5600000000001s)]
*  people for what really ultimately I think is right is kind of like, you know, it's a bit of like, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=613.44s)]
*  man, this case should have been brought years ago. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=618.72s)]
*  Well, not at all. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=621.36s)]
*  In relation to that, they were told to stand down from doing that because of the, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=622.16s)]
*  you can't indict a sitting president, and that's paused. So that's another legal [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=626.88s)]
*  theory that's going to have to be tested. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=630.88s)]
*  Jason, the feds looked at this years ago, and they decided not to press charges. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=632.3199999999999s)]
*  They were told to not do it because he was a sitting president. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=635.52s)]
*  No, they were. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=638.7199999999999s)]
*  No, he's been out of office now for a couple of years. Why didn't they move forward? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=639.1999999999999s)]
*  They were. That was the process they were doing. So that's been established. The previous D.A. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=642.88s)]
*  said he was told to stand down because the question was in office. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=649.6800000000001s)]
*  Cyrus Vance decided not to prosecute on the same underlying offenses. That was his decision. He [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=652.88s)]
*  decided not to. Who told him to stand down? No one could tell him to stand down. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=657.76s)]
*  Yeah, the office of... [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=661.6800000000001s)]
*  Cyrus Vance decided not to move forward with this very same case when the statute of limitations [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=663.2800000000001s)]
*  had not expired. Now it has that Alvin Bragg's moved forward. I mean, you really have to stretch [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=668.5600000000001s)]
*  here to come up with any kind of plausibility to this case. And I mean, you have to wonder why [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=673.68s)]
*  he's doing it. Is it just naked partisanship or are they trying to make Trump the Republican nominee? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=680.8s)]
*  Well, here's what Vance said on Meet the Press this weekend. I was asked by the U.S. Attorney's [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=686.7199999999999s)]
*  Office in the Southern District to stand down on the investigation, and they were asked to stand [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=691.04s)]
*  down as well because of the... You can't indict a sitting president. So anyway, all this stuff's [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=695.76s)]
*  going to get done in the wash. I don't think we have to spend too much time on it because [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=700.08s)]
*  we'll find out, I think, in the coming weeks. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=704.64s)]
*  Do the Democrats actually want him to get convicted? Then what? He's going to be under [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=706.48s)]
*  house arrest in Mar-a-Lago because he's not going to be sent to jail. And then what? Then [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=712.08s)]
*  DeSantis actually will win the nomination. So what exactly is the perfect outcome, which is to [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=715.36s)]
*  create this theater, waste taxpayer resources only to have Trump acquitted just so that he [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=720.32s)]
*  can win the nomination and then he can go against Biden and lose? This seems so far-fetched and [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=726.4s)]
*  idiotic. Move on. Close this chapter and move on. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=730.56s)]
*  Totally. This is ripping the country apart for no reason and such a stupid case. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=735.36s)]
*  Such a stupid case. Even the people who would like to prosecute Trump, like you, Jason, I think, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=739.4399999999999s)]
*  have a problem with it. And one of the reasons why this is going to be counterproductive even to the [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=744.3199999999999s)]
*  anti-Trump forces is that by going first with this case, Alvin Bragg is poisoning the well for [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=749.68s)]
*  any future case he might bring against Trump because now all future cases against Trump are [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=756.16s)]
*  going to be seen as painted with the same brush, which is a nakedly partisan witch hunt. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=760.88s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=766.4s)]
*  And there may be other cases out there that have more validity to them, but they're all going to [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=767.04s)]
*  be seen as of a piece with this Alvin Bragg prosecution. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=771.6s)]
*  Yeah, that was Preet's position. I think it's a logical one. I don't disagree. What do you think [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=776.0s)]
*  of the other three cases, January 6th, the interference in Georgia where they recorded [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=779.8399999999999s)]
*  him on tape and then the stolen documents and the obstruction of justice? Or do you think all four [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=784.56s)]
*  cases are politically motivated and none of them have any validity to them, Sachs? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=789.3599999999999s)]
*  I mean, look, the question you have to ask is if Donald Trump was a private citizen who never ran [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=793.4399999999999s)]
*  for president, would he be the target of any of these prosecutions? I mean, he was, you know, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=797.1999999999999s)]
*  a high profile business figure for decades and he wasn't prosecuted like this. And so that's really [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=802.56s)]
*  the question you have to ask. And, you know, do we want to live- [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=806.9599999999999s)]
*  Well, in this case, you actually had Cohen go to jail. Cohen did go to jail for the same crime. So [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=809.04s)]
*  the answer is yes. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=813.1199999999999s)]
*  What? Michael Cohen wasn't prosecuted till after Trump was president. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=814.24s)]
*  No, what I'm saying is you asked if he was not president. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=817.04s)]
*  Do you really believe- [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=820.64s)]
*  If he would, let me finish. You asked if Trump was not a president, if he would have been [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=821.6800000000001s)]
*  prosecuted for this crime. In fact, another person, Michael Cohen, was prosecuted for this crime and [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=826.96s)]
*  did serve jail time. So the answer is yes, he would have been. And they brought these cases, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=830.72s)]
*  this banking kind of cases, and they brought the other one for the 1.6 million fine and weasel [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=834.96s)]
*  were going to jail. So I think they would actually. But anyway, my question to you was- [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=840.0s)]
*  I think this is- [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=844.24s)]
*  Are any, do you think all four are politically motivated is my question to you? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=844.88s)]
*  Or do you think any of them have a literary- [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=848.96s)]
*  I don't want to comment on the other cases until I see what [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=850.4s)]
*  cases actually made and what the merits of them are. However, I don't believe that all [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=853.6s)]
*  these prosecutors all over the country would be looking at Donald Trump this way if he was [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=857.6800000000001s)]
*  just a private citizen who never ran for office. And I think we have a big problem in our political [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=860.96s)]
*  system when political disagreements are criminalized. And this has been a nasty trend [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=864.72s)]
*  that's been going on for many years. It was usually, I guess, practice against staffers. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=870.96s)]
*  Here or there, you'd have some executive branch staffer would find themselves on the wrong end [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=877.2s)]
*  of a prosecution and they'd end up going to jail. Maybe they get pardoned or not. But now it's reached [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=883.52s)]
*  all the way to the top and you have presidential candidates basically being prosecuted. And I do [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=888.0s)]
*  not believe they'd be prosecuted if they were not major political figures. And it looks really bad [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=893.44s)]
*  for the political figure who is leading it right now in the Republican Party to be Joe Biden's [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=898.96s)]
*  opponent in the next election to be prosecuted by one of Joe Biden's political allies. I mean, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=904.88s)]
*  if this were happening in some other country, the United States would be criticizing it as some sort [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=910.4000000000001s)]
*  of banana republic type move. So this is not the direction we want our politics to go. And look, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=914.96s)]
*  I don't want- Don't disagree. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=921.44s)]
*  Trump to be the nominee. I support a different candidate. But I think that to be interfering [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=923.52s)]
*  in our elections, for Alvin Brack to be interfering in the political process this way [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=930.88s)]
*  is a reach and it's setting a horrible precedent for the future. I mean, we're talking about major [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=935.84s)]
*  presidential candidates being prosecuted- Let me ask a follow-up question then, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=941.4399999999999s)]
*  Sax. ... by local DAs. I mean, why would we want this? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=944.16s)]
*  So let me ask a follow-up question then. Do you, the DOJ is currently investigating Hunter Biden, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=947.1999999999999s)]
*  and then obviously that goes up to the big guy with the 10%. Do you think the DOJ should be [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=952.0s)]
*  investigating Hunter Biden or do you think we should be giving a pass to presidential [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=955.84s)]
*  presidents and their families? Well, the Hunter Biden case, I mean, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=960.48s)]
*  this is one where you've got foreign governments basically paying off Hunter Biden for political [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=964.64s)]
*  access. Now that may ultimately be legal because I think influence peddling is kind of a business [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=970.4s)]
*  that takes place all over Washington. But that actually does speak to the integrity of our [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=977.36s)]
*  political system. At the end of the day, would I send Hunter Biden to jail? No, I don't think so. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=982.96s)]
*  Like I said, I don't like criminalizing political disagreements, but what Hunter Biden did was [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=988.16s)]
*  definitely pretty shady. And you know, the- I think these are two of the- Hunter Biden and Trump and [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=992.8000000000001s)]
*  his family are both shady is my feeling on it. We got to get better candidates in here. Nikki Haley, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=998.64s)]
*  your candidate, Chamath raised $11 million last week. She's on fire. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1002.8000000000001s)]
*  Freeberg, you want to jump into this and touch the third rail? You want us to move on? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1006.64s)]
*  Let's move on. All right. So there's been a lot of [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1012.1600000000001s)]
*  Twitter back and forth about the de-dollarization. And if it's real, if it's happening, if it's not, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1015.44s)]
*  last week, China and Brazil struck a deal to trade in their own currencies. The Brazilian [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1021.76s)]
*  government announced the two countries will no longer use the US dollar as an intermediary. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1027.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't know if that's for everything they trade or for certain things they're trading. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1031.76s)]
*  It'll be a straight one for Reyes trade. China is the top US rival, obviously, and Brazil is one [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1035.6s)]
*  of the largest economies in Latin America. What are your thoughts? Generally speaking, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1041.6s)]
*  Freeberg, I know that you have some exposure here, you know, with your company that I think you [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1046.48s)]
*  spacked recently, and you have some knowledge of the space, right? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1053.36s)]
*  Well, I mean, China and Brazil are pretty sizable trade partners. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1056.0s)]
*  I think it's around $150 billion a year of bilateral trade. So China historically has made [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1060.0s)]
*  a lot of investments through their companies in railways, infrastructure, waterways, ports, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1067.68s)]
*  and infrastructure to support the agriculture manufacturing economies in Brazil. And it's a [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1074.8s)]
*  very deep tie. Obviously, the closeness of that relationship, China became a bigger trading partner [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1083.04s)]
*  for Brazil in 2009, surpassing the US. By the way, China has had similar trading strategies [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1088.4s)]
*  in Africa, in Australia, they've bought several companies in Australia, they've made massive [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1095.6000000000001s)]
*  infrastructure investments. The currency of trade is one element of a broader intertwining [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1100.64s)]
*  that China has kind of enabled by using its resources to invest in infrastructure development [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1110.3200000000002s)]
*  and then participating in the economic value and gain that arises from that. It still also supports [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1115.76s)]
*  the local country, the local population, the local economies in a meaningful way. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1120.96s)]
*  I think it's worth noting that the anti globalization moment that we're having in [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1126.16s)]
*  the US, and it may be a longer term trend, doesn't mean that globalization and global trade is going [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1131.92s)]
*  to slow down between China and other really important world resource nations around the world. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1138.0s)]
*  So the Brazil-China summit that happened a week ago, where a lot of Brazilian executives [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1143.68s)]
*  went to China and had a very deep set of dialogues, but they also signed a ton of agreements on trade. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1150.72s)]
*  And also in some of those cases, the trade being done in non US dollar denominated currency, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1157.76s)]
*  is worth noting as being that if the US does continue to push for de globalization, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1164.0800000000002s)]
*  we can only leverage our side of those relationships. China will continue to make [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1170.88s)]
*  investments, continue to develop trade and continue to develop really deep tie-ins with [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1176.16s)]
*  countries around the world from a resource perspective, from an economic perspective. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1180.16s)]
*  And ultimately, the leverage will sit with them on what currency folks are going to trade in. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1184.72s)]
*  So what we're seeing with the China-Saudi discussion around the Petro Yuan, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1189.76s)]
*  which doesn't seem to be really a standard thing yet, but we're starting to see inklings of some [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1193.8400000000001s)]
*  deals happening in Yuan, but it's more related to the depth of the Chinese trade relationship [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1199.04s)]
*  with all these nations around the world. So the more we kind of, as the US think we want to [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1203.92s)]
*  de globalize and reduce our trade relationships with other nations, the more we're out of the [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1210.3999999999999s)]
*  way in allowing China to do that. I think it's worth observing that the Chinese economy will grow, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1215.04s)]
*  the depth of their relationships will grow, potentially the strength and importance of [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1219.76s)]
*  their currency will continue to mount as they build these really deep infrastructure and [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1223.52s)]
*  investment tie-ins around the world. Chamath, what does a party trading in Yuan do with the Yuan? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1228.0s)]
*  Do they buy a bunch of stuff from China? What happens to the Yuan? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1233.36s)]
*  Nothing. This whole thing is a huge nothing burger. This is the third deal that China has done. The [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1237.6s)]
*  other two countries are Pakistan and Brazil. And the reason why is I see people on Twitter now [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1242.56s)]
*  breathlessly rambling on about de-dollarization and all of this stuff. And I think if any of these [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1248.8s)]
*  people would think from first principles, the first thing that you would know is that the [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1256.8s)]
*  Yuan is pegged to the US dollar. And so as long as it's pegged, whether you trade through the US [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1261.28s)]
*  dollar or you don't and you directly go to Yuan, you're indexed to the US dollar. And then you use [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1268.24s)]
*  a dollar swap to convert it into the currency you need. So I don't know, I think this is kind of like [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1274.32s)]
*  a lot of folks who don't really know what's going on. What do you think about the depth of China's [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1280.1599999999999s)]
*  trade relationship? So forget about the denomination of the currency, but the fact that [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1285.44s)]
*  the statistic now is that China is the top trading partner with 120 countries. They surpassed the US [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1290.4s)]
*  with many of these countries over the last decade or two in particular, and continue to increase the [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1297.92s)]
*  scale relative to the US where we're kind of decreasing our dependence on nations and reducing [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1304.0s)]
*  our trading. The reason why China has had so much dominance as a trading partner [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1309.8400000000001s)]
*  and the reason why China's central bank has the largest amount of foreign US dollar reserves, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1316.16s)]
*  about three and a half trillion dollars, is exactly because of the thing that you want to ignore in [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1322.0s)]
*  order to have this highfalutin intellectual conversation. It is pegged to the US dollar. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1326.88s)]
*  And until it is unpegged in a free floating currency, we will never know what the real market [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1332.88s)]
*  clearing price is. And just to be clear, been able to hold on, China has been very effectively [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1338.4s)]
*  able to manipulate this currency since they were brought into the WTO in order to engender that [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1343.6s)]
*  trading partner status. They were able to artificially suppress the value of their currency [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1350.9599999999998s)]
*  so that exports from China could gain traction in countries all around the world. You have to take [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1358.3999999999999s)]
*  into account this currency peg and you have to ask the question, where would the currency be if it [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1364.9599999999998s)]
*  wasn't free floating? And then what would the incentives be for folks to replace the dollar? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1370.88s)]
*  And I think that there's a lot of interesting questions there that are worth asking, but I [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1377.6000000000001s)]
*  think you have to be a little bit more intellectually honest to have the discussion. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1381.2s)]
*  And just for clarity, Chamath, you said they already have these deals with [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1383.92s)]
*  Pakistan and Brazil. You meant Pakistan and Russia, I think. They already have those deals with those [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1388.3200000000002s)]
*  two. Pakistan and Russia. Right. Okay, good. I just want to make sure it's clear there. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1392.88s)]
*  Sax, do you have any thoughts on this? Is this an example of people just maybe taking the Ray [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1397.9199999999998s)]
*  Dalio book and it fits a certain narrative and overhyping it? Or do you think this is an actual [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1404.0s)]
*  real trend in the world to be concerned about? I think de-dollarization hasn't happened yet, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1408.1599999999999s)]
*  but I think it's a risk. And I think there's a bunch of reasons why the risk is growing. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1414.4799999999998s)]
*  So first of all, we have $32 trillion in debt. Someone has to finance that debt. And the bigger [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1420.4799999999998s)]
*  that number gets, the more unattractive our debt is because they have to be concerned that we're [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1426.72s)]
*  eventually going to monetize the debt, pay it back by printing a bunch of new dollars. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1431.6000000000001s)]
*  So that's point number one is we have these massive deficits in debts. Number two is that we [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1435.76s)]
*  have, I think in the last couple of years, really weaponized the dollar. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1443.92s)]
*  So if you look at what we've done with Ukraine and Russia, we basically seized [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1448.16s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars of Russian reserves that were held in dollars. We've [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1453.92s)]
*  excluded them from the swift banking system. We've imposed massive sanctions on them. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1459.1200000000001s)]
*  And in fact, we now have sanctions on a huge number of countries all over the world. So we're [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1464.24s)]
*  very sanction happy, all of which makes these countries view the dollar as an unreliable store [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1469.3600000000001s)]
*  of value. Why would you store your money in something that can be taken away by the US [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1477.52s)]
*  and specifically by the State Department? So I think this is a major change in the way that we [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1484.8799999999999s)]
*  view the dollar over the last couple of years is we're going to use it as a weapon. Again, that makes [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1490.96s)]
*  it view- Well, that's not the first time we've ever done that, right? We've done sanctions against [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1494.8799999999999s)]
*  many different- We've done sanctions, but as far as I know, we've never seized foreign currency [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1499.28s)]
*  reserves and excluded a country from SWIFT, which is the banking system, as an instrument of US [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1503.68s)]
*  foreign policy. So I could be wrong about that, but this was a major event when it happened. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1509.04s)]
*  Remember, we also did stuff like seize the yachts and the foreign holdings of Russian oligarchs. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1514.0800000000002s)]
*  Remember their ill-gotten gains? We suddenly decided they were all gotten. Let me tell you, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1521.04s)]
*  we didn't think they were ill-gotten when those Russian billionaires were buying those yachts or [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1525.6000000000001s)]
*  buying New York real estate or London real estate- Or investing in Facebook. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1530.0s)]
*  Or investing in companies here or buying sports teams or what have you. So we didn't think they [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1533.92s)]
*  were ill-gotten. Hold on. We didn't think they were ill-gotten at the time that they were actually [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1540.64s)]
*  made and spent, but we decided subsequently we're just going to seize those things. Well, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1544.32s)]
*  again, if you are a foreign country or a wealthy person in a foreign country or just trying to [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1549.2s)]
*  decide where you're going to keep your money, you may not want it to be liable to the vagaries of [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1555.44s)]
*  US foreign policy. So I think all these things do matter. And when you're running the kind of debt [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1560.72s)]
*  and deficits we have and you're making the US dollar less attractive, you are running a risk. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1567.04s)]
*  I mean, that's the fact. So I think- So we should be keeping people we have disagreements with on [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1572.4s)]
*  the dollar standard because that's good in terms of power for us, which I think opens us up to [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1576.16s)]
*  a broader discussion. Okay, just to clarify this, it's not even the dollar standard, right? Like, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1581.28s)]
*  what this deal was is to use this thing called SIPs. And SIPs is the non-dollar competitor to [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1585.84s)]
*  Swift. And so you settle, right, across, let's just say you have two trading partners in two [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1592.96s)]
*  completely different countries that use a bank in each of their local areas. They typically swap [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1601.12s)]
*  to dollars and then they transfer, right, using this backbone of the financial infrastructure [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1606.4s)]
*  called Swift. China has built a competitor to it called SIPs, C-I-P-S, and China's been going around [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1611.6000000000001s)]
*  and signing folks up. Makes a ton of sense, right? Hey, listen, if we're trading between each other, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1618.88s)]
*  let's just use that. So I think it's important to not paint this with more of a brush than it [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1623.76s)]
*  should be. I'm not saying that de-dollarization couldn't happen. I just think that everybody [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1628.96s)]
*  tries to take one random data point and conflate it all together to reinforce a redali point from [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1634.0s)]
*  a book three years ago. I do think there's a group of catastrophists who maybe are maybe hoping this [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1638.96s)]
*  happens or it's a great Twitter fodder. I think we are headed for some sort of government debt [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1643.76s)]
*  crisis. I said that there's gonna be three prongs to this financial crisis. One was these long data [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1648.24s)]
*  bonds having unrealized losses, which is causing problems in regional community banks. The second [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1653.68s)]
*  piece of it's the commercial real estate crisis, which I think is metastasizing right now, which [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1659.36s)]
*  is also gonna be a banking crisis once all those unrealized losses come due. And the third piece of [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1665.1999999999998s)]
*  it is government debt crisis. We have this $32 trillion debt that we're now having to refinance [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1670.8799999999999s)]
*  at much higher interest rates. I've read somewhere that half our government debt, so 16 billion, is [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1676.4799999999998s)]
*  going to come due, 16, sorry, trillion, yeah. And it's gonna have to be refinanced in the next three [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1681.4399999999998s)]
*  years. The average rate on that debt is 1.7%. Well, if you want to refinance it at 10-year rates, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1688.08s)]
*  you're gonna be looking at somewhere between 3.5% and 4%, maybe more. So you're looking at a doubling [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1695.9199999999998s)]
*  of the interest costs. And I also read that by 2030, we're gonna have over a trillion dollars [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1701.04s)]
*  of interest expense owed by the US government every year. That is money that's not funding [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1706.8s)]
*  anyone's social security, it's not funding anyone's healthcare, it's not funding one weapons program, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1712.24s)]
*  it's not funding anything we want. It's just the VIG. It's gonna be more than a quarter [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1716.96s)]
*  of our total federal budget. Yeah. And this is where you start gambling when you're chasing [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1721.3600000000001s)]
*  that VIG payment, you start taking risks. This is also where you have to expect the Fed will really [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1725.04s)]
*  want inflation to stay high. That's sort of what we've said before. The only way out of this [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1729.76s)]
*  mathematically is to keep rates high. But the other thing, David, that you when you mention all of [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1733.68s)]
*  this is, what about every other country? If you think that's happening in the United States, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1737.92s)]
*  I think it's important to make sure we at least consider every other major economy, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1743.04s)]
*  because it's not as if they're pristinely sitting on the sidelines. While this happens to the US, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1747.44s)]
*  this is my whole argument the whole time, which is if you're going to have this argument, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1752.0s)]
*  you need to do it thoughtfully and relatively, right, because the euro is in the same amount [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1756.08s)]
*  of trouble. If you look across, it's not as if China is actually sitting pretty and smelling like [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1761.36s)]
*  roses either. Every major economy or trading bloc in the world is going to go through this at the same [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1767.36s)]
*  time. So it becomes a relative trade argument. And there, I just don't know enough to know whether [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1772.64s)]
*  the US is poorly positioned versus Europe or China. But it just seems like you get back to a place [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1777.44s)]
*  where it's like, okay, we need to find the flight to safety. What is the canonical flight to safety? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1783.44s)]
*  If it's not a commodity like gold, it's probably the dollar until it's not. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1788.48s)]
*  Yeah, okay, free bird. Obviously, other countries have even more acute problems, higher debt to GDP, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1792.8000000000002s)]
*  which means higher debt payments. Just rounding third here on this issue. Any final thoughts on [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1799.12s)]
*  de-dollarization and servicing our debt? Look, it's we're in trouble. And it's, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1805.04s)]
*  it's unclear the timing and the path. But the arithmetic is pretty simple. In addition to the [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1813.6799999999998s)]
*  point Sachs made, you guys saw the news. The city of Chicago has a $44 billion pension hole. That's [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1819.6s)]
*  just the tip of the iceberg on unfunded pension liabilities from both state government, city [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1826.88s)]
*  government, even private institutions. This is, again, hundreds of millions of people worldwide [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1832.88s)]
*  that are expecting money coming to them from institutions that ultimately the federal [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1840.0800000000002s)]
*  government of the US is likely going to have to backstop to some degree. So that's another huge [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1845.0400000000002s)]
*  check that's going to need to be written that the federal government is inevitably going to have to [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1850.0s)]
*  write because we're not going to just let all these people have no money and become starving. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1853.44s)]
*  And Social Security right now is projected to go bankrupt sometime between 2030 and 2035. So we're [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1857.6000000000001s)]
*  going to have to write a check to cover the hole there. Plus, the interest payment checks. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1863.76s)]
*  So much point free bird of like, relative to other societies, other countries. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1870.88s)]
*  Yeah, so the very likely case is that relative wealth will decline. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1879.52s)]
*  So in the near term, I think it's inevitable we have higher tax rates. I've said this before, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1890.88s)]
*  because in order to kind of meet the gap, even if we have these austerity measures or reduce costs [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1894.3200000000002s)]
*  or reduce the budget as the Republicans are going to push for is the debt ceiling debate reaches its [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1899.28s)]
*  apex in 60 days from now, which you better believe this is going to be pretty, pretty damn [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1904.8s)]
*  dramatic. And there's going to be real questions of what happens if the US defaults on its treasuries. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1910.8s)]
*  If the US defaults on obligations it has on treasuries, there will be a real shift away [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1916.72s)]
*  from using those assets as the baseline of the risk free rate worldwide. What the other thing [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1925.36s)]
*  will be, I don't know. I'll speak about the challenges I see with Bitcoin, you know, if we [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1931.44s)]
*  want to at some point. Oh, did you hit a million yet? But if you put all of this together, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1937.2s)]
*  you're going to have to source income somewhere. You're going to have to take a piece of the assets [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1944.8s)]
*  and a piece of the income away from the private citizenry. So you're going to have to tax. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1948.88s)]
*  And that tax will be used to kind of fill some of the hole. And then more of the hole will be [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1953.8400000000001s)]
*  filled by printing money. And that will lead to this kind of inflation of asset values, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1958.4s)]
*  which ultimately means that the relative cost of things go up and relative wealth goes down. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1963.3600000000001s)]
*  And I think that's the point to take note is that anyone who's concentrated assets is going to have [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1968.16s)]
*  them effectively lost in the washout. Sacks, you want to add? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1973.52s)]
*  Well, I just want to add a couple of details there because Fiber went pretty quickly over [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1980.0800000000002s)]
*  a couple of those examples. So just to take that Chicago case, the numbers I saw in an article [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1984.4s)]
*  this week, I think it was in the Wall Street Journal, was that 80% of the property taxes [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1988.64s)]
*  in Chicago are now going just to pay for pensions. So 80% are going to pay former workers, not current [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=1993.6000000000001s)]
*  city workers. And moreover, those pensions are only 25% funded. So they've already overpromised [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2000.0800000000002s)]
*  by 75% benefits that they can't afford. How is this going to work? And you saw that we just had [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2008.08s)]
*  an election there. And rather than fix the problem, they voted for a candidate, Brandon Johnson, who is [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2014.8s)]
*  even softer on crime than Lori Lightfoot. And the reason for that is because the government [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2021.28s)]
*  workers unions basically all supported him. So you have a situation in these blue cities and states [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2029.36s)]
*  where there is a massive civil service. They are the strongest special interest [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2035.36s)]
*  in local and state politics. They have already taken huge appropriations out of the state budget [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2040.4799999999998s)]
*  in the form of these pensions, which aren't even adequately funded. We can barely afford them as [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2047.6s)]
*  they are. Should we have pension sacks? What do you think? Should we just have people doing 401Ks? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2051.6s)]
*  Sure. So what happened in the 1980s when there was a lot of pension reform in the private sector is [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2057.12s)]
*  you move from defined benefit to defined contribution. So you start having more defined [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2061.6s)]
*  contribution like 401K. The way that these public pensions work is defined benefit. So [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2068.3199999999997s)]
*  what they'll do is they'll say that we're going to take your last year of employment with the [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2074.24s)]
*  city or state. And whatever the amount of money was you made in that last year, you're going to [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2079.2799999999997s)]
*  get 80% or 90% of it for the rest of your, not just your life, but your spouse's life too. And [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2084.56s)]
*  moreover, any overtime you earned becomes part of that calculation. So everyone knows this game. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2089.76s)]
*  And so what you see is in their final year, state or city employees will load up on the overtime. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2096.2400000000002s)]
*  They'll earn twice as much and then they'll get 90% of that. They get 90% of that for the rest of [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2102.0800000000004s)]
*  them and their spouse's life. We just can't afford to have rules like that that don't make any sense. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2107.28s)]
*  And so, but the point is that the benefit that's been defined bears no relationship [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2112.8s)]
*  to the amount of money that's gone into these pensions. Right. And so you have a simple solution [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2119.2s)]
*  here. You have a huge unfunded liability. Yeah. But to Freiburg's point, every blue city and state in [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2123.8399999999997s)]
*  the country is going to have this problem. And who's going to pick up these expenses. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2128.7999999999997s)]
*  You bring up great points, but you just mash them all together in this mashed potato of random things [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2133.3599999999997s)]
*  like unfunded pension liabilities, you won RIMB, RIAI's trading, and they're like the same thing. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2138.96s)]
*  They're not the same thing. They're driven by totally different. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2146.48s)]
*  But we're talking about the existential threat. You just kind of throw them in this like amalgam [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2150.4s)]
*  soup and outcomes like these prognostication. So I'm just saying like, these are important topics, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2154.72s)]
*  but I'm just saying, I do think they're motivated by totally different things. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2159.92s)]
*  And they're not related as much as we think they are related. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2163.76s)]
*  I think they're related. Let me walk you through how they're related. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2167.12s)]
*  Okay. I want to hear how the RIAI's you want trade is connected to the Chicago pension system. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2169.44s)]
*  The holes need to be filled. So the money is not going to just not get paid to the pensioners. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2174.56s)]
*  Social Security is not going to go away. Just like we saw in France. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2181.04s)]
*  If you start to do that, you have revolutions in the street. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2185.2s)]
*  There's literally bonfires at intersections in France, in Paris today, because people don't want [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2188.88s)]
*  to wait another two years before they get their pension payments. So ultimately, that check has [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2194.4s)]
*  to be written. When you add up the column of how much money is not on the balance sheet today, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2198.96s)]
*  how much liability is not on the balance sheet today, that is ultimately going to have to get [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2204.0s)]
*  paid out. And the US government is going to print money to pay it out. It indicates that there is a [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2207.92s)]
*  higher degree of uncertainty on whether or not I'm actually going to get the value back for the bonds [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2212.88s)]
*  that I'm buying in US dollar denominated form, or that the US dollar is actually going to be strong [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2217.92s)]
*  enough to cover the costs or has enough kind of, you know, or has too much volatility because of [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2222.48s)]
*  this uncertainty. And I think that that's really where people start to say, well, maybe the US [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2228.32s)]
*  dollar isn't that risk free rate where it's a strong economy with a great balance sheet, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2232.64s)]
*  great economic growth. There's certainly extraordinary potential because of the freedoms [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2236.72s)]
*  that we have to operate in this country as individuals through the enterprise, through [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2240.8799999999997s)]
*  the innovation, through the entrepreneurship, through the attraction of talent from all over [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2244.7999999999997s)]
*  the world to come here. But at the end of the day, we do seem to have a very big set of checks that [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2247.8399999999997s)]
*  we're going to have to write. And as those liabilities start to mount, there becomes a [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2252.48s)]
*  real question on do I really want to hold dollars? Maybe I want to hold something else. And maybe I [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2256.8799999999997s)]
*  diversify a little bit. And maybe instead of holding just dollars, I also hold other things. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2261.44s)]
*  And as that starts to happen, you see a little bit of a shift. It's not an overnight thing. It's all [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2265.2000000000003s)]
*  catastrophic one or the other. But it starts to bring into question whether the US dollar is the [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2269.68s)]
*  standard de facto system that's used for trade around the world. That's the point. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2274.0s)]
*  And Sachs, there is a solution to this superannuation is done in the UK and in Australia, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2278.64s)]
*  where you contribute, you're forced to contribute to your 401k, essentially, but you get to learn [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2284.64s)]
*  how to put money away and you become a little more. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2291.12s)]
*  You have a little more authority over your future with these pensions where [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2295.92s)]
*  you're responsible for saving and you're kind of forced to save. And it seems to have worked [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2300.88s)]
*  really well in Australia and other places where people have great savings and you don't have this [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2304.8s)]
*  major debt load by the government doing it. So it's something for people to look into. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2308.96s)]
*  Sachs, did you want to add anything to this? Because they can beat this one to death. Just [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2313.2799999999997s)]
*  make it quick. Yeah. Well, I don't think we've necessarily beaten it to death because I think [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2316.48s)]
*  it is a huge issue. I mean, look, the part of Chamos's argument that I agree with is that you [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2319.76s)]
*  do have to evaluate the dollar on relative terms. And you can argue that the US and the dollar, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2324.96s)]
*  let's call it the most eligible bachelor in the leper colony. Nothing started falling off on the [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2333.92s)]
*  man yet, but that doesn't mean that it won't. That's really good. That's really good. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2339.28s)]
*  By the way, the first default might be the nose is falling off. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2346.48s)]
*  You know, the economist Herb Stein once said that if something cannot go on forever, it won't. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2349.76s)]
*  What we're doing right now cannot go on forever. We are running deficits and debts and unfunded [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2354.4s)]
*  liabilities that we cannot afford. And so it will stop. And the only question is how it stops. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2358.64s)]
*  Well, I think there's, yeah. And it may stop in a way that is not, it's not a voluntary choice by us. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2365.92s)]
*  Crash the car basically. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2374.16s)]
*  You guys want to make a bet a friendly wager for charity? Oh, what happens in June? [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2375.2000000000003s)]
*  I'll make a bet with you guys. June, you mean the debt ceiling? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2380.56s)]
*  Yeah. What do you guys think happens? You think this is going to be a [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2383.04s)]
*  fractious chaotic thing where the markets get roiled? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2385.84s)]
*  No, I think it's going to be a pretty rubber straight forward deal where they're going to, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2389.12s)]
*  it's going to come down to the wire. But my guess is no one's going to want to default on the debt. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2393.6800000000003s)]
*  Yep. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2397.6800000000003s)]
*  And there's going to be some concessions on spending. And ultimately, the debt ceiling [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2398.24s)]
*  will get extended. And that those concessions on spending will allow the Republican Party to [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2404.8799999999997s)]
*  save face with their voters and say, look, we, we got some concessions here. I'm not sure [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2410.0s)]
*  they're going to be enough to really address any of the major problems [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2415.52s)]
*  that the US is facing over the longer term. But you know, certainly letting the [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2419.04s)]
*  debt ceiling hit and defaulting is catastrophic. Everyone knows that. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2423.92s)]
*  I was freeburg. I think the majority case is a bunch of hand wringing and then they make a [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2427.28s)]
*  concession. All the people that are interested in this topic, I would go use the way back machine [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2431.12s)]
*  and go and read all of the articles in the 80s, where you could replace China with Japan. And [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2435.36s)]
*  what happened with Japan is that Japan just hit a demographic wall, not dissimilar to what China's [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2442.4s)]
*  about to hit in the next 15 or 20 years. Right. It's a good counter argument. Yeah, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2447.44s)]
*  it's a good counter argument. Yeah, that's a really good point. And I think that there is this [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2451.44s)]
*  element of, you know, China as the primary threat. But I think the, the bigger problem, Chamath, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2454.96s)]
*  is that we have voted ourselves into a stupor. We have allowed ourselves to accrue these liabilities [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2459.68s)]
*  that are in many cases not on the balance sheet that we simply cannot afford to pay. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2467.84s)]
*  And the social unrest that will arise, what if, and when we don't pay them, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2473.04s)]
*  or the economic cost of us actually paying them, either of those are going to be pretty [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2476.56s)]
*  significant. But that's under that's water under the bridge. And it has nothing to do with China. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2480.8s)]
*  It has just everything to do with how the US is spending. Thank you for being intellectually [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2484.8s)]
*  honest. This is my point. I agree with you about the importance of these unfunded liabilities. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2488.6400000000003s)]
*  I just completely disagree with you that this argument about these things being so hyper [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2493.6000000000004s)]
*  connected, or that all of a sudden we're at the cliff of de dollar ization, I don't think it's [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2498.5600000000004s)]
*  rooted in facts. And I think again, it ignores this unbelievably important piece of logic that [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2504.0s)]
*  all of you guys that say this tend to ignore. And it's still in it's not even well addressed [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2509.6s)]
*  in Dalio's book, which is it is a pegged currency. And the minute you unpack it, none of you know what [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2514.4s)]
*  happens to it, except that it probably isn't where it's trading today. And if you actually then have [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2523.36s)]
*  to factor in dollar reserves that everybody holds, that thing would skyrocket in value, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2528.0s)]
*  and it would crush the export value of the yuan and it happens to all currencies. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2532.72s)]
*  And this is this funny thing that has happened to the United States, which is that it ran forward, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2537.3599999999997s)]
*  and it transitioned its economy to a service led economy faster than other countries and other [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2542.48s)]
*  economies and other currencies did. And nobody wants to just talk about that. Except it's the [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2547.8399999999997s)]
*  fact we're talking about that's what sort of drives us. Good sex. I don't think the big risk [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2554.64s)]
*  is that all of a sudden the dollar gets replaced by the yuan as the world's reserve currency. I [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2559.2s)]
*  think Freiburg lays out a more intermediate path, which is people start to hedge their dollar [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2563.44s)]
*  exposure and decisions that used to be automatic like trading oil and dollars, you know, the so [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2569.84s)]
*  called petrodollar now becomes a little bit, you know, more of a decision. So, you know, the Saudi [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2575.6s)]
*  That's what happened with the pound sterling. It was a similar story. And it was not an overnight [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2581.6s)]
*  collapse. I mean, there were certainly these kind of punctuated moments where there were hits. But [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2586.0s)]
*  you know, the history is that there was a slow devaluation over time and the, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2589.92s)]
*  you know, as a result of obviously the economic pressure and the uncertain. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2593.92s)]
*  Actually, no, what happened to pounds sterling was that it was pegged to the US dollar and then it [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2597.36s)]
*  became unpegged. So exactly what I'm talking about, even post that even post that if it's a free [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2600.64s)]
*  floating currency. Yeah, you're proving, dude, you're proving my point. When Soros broke the [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2605.92s)]
*  back of the US dollar, what he forced George Brown or when he forced the chancellor, the extractor [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2610.88s)]
*  do was to basically depeg the pound. And then yes, you're right. It's been like this ever since. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2615.2s)]
*  Yeah, it was what I'm saying was not if you let it be free floating, nobody wants to trade in [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2622.48s)]
*  that other currency. Everybody wants the dollar. As bad as the dollar is, David's right, it is the [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2626.64s)]
*  the worst affected leper in the leper colony. Yes, the answer is lepers all in the colony. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2632.3999999999996s)]
*  This is why you have to have if you're going to be intellectually honest, just have a relative [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2638.3999999999996s)]
*  conversation about all of the currencies, and all the things that they're also going through, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2641.84s)]
*  which are also not not perfect. The debt payments are emerging and the frontier markets are [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2645.52s)]
*  extraordinary. Just realize that if you want to go and peg your economy to somebody else's back, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2650.2400000000002s)]
*  they also come with their own trials and tribulations that you have to risk manage as well. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2657.1200000000003s)]
*  And now you have to decide on balance. Do you want to risk manage a centrally governed economy? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2661.52s)]
*  Right from a central bureau, or a freewheeling democratic like these are all the discussions [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2667.04s)]
*  should have. Yeah, there's a lot of choices there. Just back to the the non currency part of this for [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2672.16s)]
*  a second. There are a lot of like connections between these things. I actually think there is [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2678.0s)]
*  a strong connection between what's happening, for example, in Chicago with the out of control civil [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2682.08s)]
*  service and unfunded pensions all the way to the dollar status. But there's also a connection [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2688.56s)]
*  between commercial real estate and these pensions. So on a previous show, we talked about the [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2693.52s)]
*  commercial real estate looming crisis. And a lot of people thought that, you know, some of the [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2699.6s)]
*  comments were just talking our book, which is not true. I don't own I don't have a dollar invested [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2705.8399999999997s)]
*  in any of these office towers. But you know who does pension funds? Yes, who owns these office [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2710.88s)]
*  towers. So you're talking about pension funds that are three quarters unfunded. And they may have a [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2716.64s)]
*  lot less funds than they even think they do, because we're about to have a huge reckoning, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2723.04s)]
*  where all of a sudden, these office towers that were supposed to be blue chip, that were supposed [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2727.04s)]
*  to have the best collateral there was in major American cities. Now all of a sudden, they may [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2732.32s)]
*  not be nearly as valuable as they thought they were. And and if they don't own the building, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2738.16s)]
*  they definitely own the debt 100% for sure. In the fixed income portfolios of all these pension [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2742.48s)]
*  systems are the debt that was used to finance these buildings by the REITs and by you know, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2748.4s)]
*  the big real estate funds that put those things together. So you're absolutely right, they are [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2753.44s)]
*  100% impacted by what's about to happen. We're not we're not going to allow given the civil unrest [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2757.44s)]
*  and social unrest risk. And obviously, as a democracy, we're not going to allow that all to go [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2762.4s)]
*  to zero. And we're not going to let pensioners not get paid. Ultimately, that's just a kiss of [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2768.32s)]
*  death. Maybe pension payments are reduced to some degree. But again, Paris is a really great example [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2773.04s)]
*  of as you start to try and shift the economic guarantees that have been made to pensioners, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2779.2000000000003s)]
*  even slightly. Yeah, what was it two years in retirement? 62? Yeah, and it was certainly like, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2783.28s)]
*  you know, you could sit here and argue what people for years for their whole life, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2790.48s)]
*  had this expectation set. We have all for our whole careers invested in the social security [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2794.88s)]
*  benefits that were owed as retirees through every paycheck that we've received. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2801.6800000000003s)]
*  And those social security payments may not end up coming back to us if social security is allowed [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2806.2400000000002s)]
*  to go bankrupt. So ultimately, the government has to set step in and issue new dollars to make that [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2810.8s)]
*  up. Then the economic question is what happens to the value of the dollar? What happens to the value [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2817.52s)]
*  the economy and so on as you issued trillions of dollars to fill these holes? Let me ask a question [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2821.2000000000003s)]
*  that's a little more positive here, perhaps, which is, is there a path out of this? You know, debt [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2827.04s)]
*  cycle we're in? And what are the top ways in which we're going to get ourselves out of this? I have [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2834.56s)]
*  three that come off the top of my head. Hold on. I have three off the top of my head. Number one is [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2841.04s)]
*  austerity measures. Number two is productivity through technology. And perhaps number three [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2846.24s)]
*  is maybe recruiting more entrepreneurs here to start more companies and, you know, fill some of [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2852.48s)]
*  these jobs. So intelligent immigration, which I want to hire taxes. Yeah. Number one is higher [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2859.12s)]
*  taxes in terms of what's like that's a four spending. That would be a fourth one. That's [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2864.3199999999997s)]
*  it. So look, higher taxes, because you can go after assets, you can go after wealth. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2870.08s)]
*  So there will be higher taxes. Okay. So I still think I still think we'll end up seeing 70% tax [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2874.08s)]
*  rates on the wealthiest people. 70%? I don't see I don't see it being like unpopular. I think it's [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2879.52s)]
*  going to be unpopular with the wealthy. It's going to be popular elsewhere to fill the hole. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2886.88s)]
*  Second is cut back on spending. But that's a really hard thing to do because, you know, as we've [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2890.88s)]
*  talked about in the past, people vote to get more stuff. So you put the politician in is going to [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2894.88s)]
*  vote to get you more stuff. You don't vote people in to go cut spending. So generally, you know, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2899.92s)]
*  we're going to likely see number one happen first. Maybe there'll be a reckoning where you kind of [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2904.96s)]
*  reduce spending, it's going to take extraordinary political will and an extraordinary depth of [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2910.08s)]
*  education and diffusion of understanding of this this key critical economic problem amongst the [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2914.8s)]
*  voting class, which is a really hard thing to realize. I think number three, you're saying [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2921.1200000000003s)]
*  get the public to understand to understand that we have to have austerity measures. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2926.32s)]
*  Yeah, and then number three, and basically people are going to have to make sacrifices. So the first [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2931.92s)]
*  sacrifice will be the wealthy, they're going to have to sacrifice through higher taxes. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2936.96s)]
*  The second sacrifice will be everyone else by seeing reduced spending and reduced kind of [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2940.1600000000003s)]
*  services, the services, etc. The third is the hopeful one, but we don't have a guarantee on [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2944.8s)]
*  this, which is, do we see economic growth through productivity gains? Can we create leverage with [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2950.48s)]
*  our resources and our people by using new technologies to get more with less? And you know, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2956.8s)]
*  anytime, yeah, like, again, I gave the example last time, but when a tractor was introduced in [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2961.76s)]
*  agriculture, all the people that were farming the ground didn't have a job anymore. But what happened [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2966.4s)]
*  is new jobs emerged in making tractors and servicing those tractors in, you know, gas [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2970.72s)]
*  pipelines to get gas to the tractors, all these economies emerged as a result of that economic [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2975.12s)]
*  technical innovation. So I think as we see AI and other innovations hit the market, you know, new [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2980.08s)]
*  economies and new industries, hopefully, really blossom, and we can benefit from that economic [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2985.52s)]
*  growth and also lower costs for people on purchasing goods and services. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2991.12s)]
*  We've identified four things. When Reagan came in, wasn't wasn't the highest tax rate like, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=2995.2799999999997s)]
*  like 70%? Yes, yeah, that was the top marginal tax rate 70%. 70% is not unheard of, it will [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3000.16s)]
*  happen again in the US. Well, and but Reagan unleashed an economic boom by flattening the [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3005.44s)]
*  tax structure because marginal tax rates created disincentive for people to work and produce more. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3010.16s)]
*  And so there is a big economic hit from this. Yeah. And remember what this 1970s were like, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3016.7999999999997s)]
*  it was the malaise days of Jimmy Carter, we had a horrible economy with high inflation, and everybody [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3022.3199999999997s)]
*  was paying high tax rates and the government wasn't making that much revenue, because there [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3027.92s)]
*  wasn't as much economic activity going on. And during the 1980s, we had an economic boom and the [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3032.4s)]
*  government actually collected more revenue with lower tax rates because so much economic progress [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3037.2000000000003s)]
*  was unlocked. Sax, we identified four things. Just like we've learned nothing, which one is [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3043.28s)]
*  the most important here? Which ones are the most important? We talked about austerity, we talked [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3048.48s)]
*  about increasing taxes, we talked about innovation and efficiency, and then we talked about [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3052.16s)]
*  immigration, recruiting more highly talented people. When you look at those four, do you have [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3055.76s)]
*  any to add to that list to get out of this? And which ones do you think are the most important? [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3059.6800000000003s)]
*  And why? When you look at federal tax revenue, over a 50 year period, go look at the Fred [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3063.1200000000003s)]
*  charts, what you see is that quite independent of the top marginal tax rate, the amount of [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3071.5200000000004s)]
*  federal receipts that the government's able to collect is roughly around 19%, plus or minus 2%. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3079.0400000000004s)]
*  And so you can only get so much blood from a stone. You can try to raise the top marginal rates, but [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3086.4s)]
*  then rich people have an incentive to basically find more tax protected strategies. So the history [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3091.6800000000003s)]
*  of this thing going back 50 years is you can only extract so much from taxes. And what you're better [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3098.4s)]
*  off is a lower tax rate that is broader based. And you go for economic growth that produces more [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3104.1600000000003s)]
*  activity. But look, if you if you're spending too much, there's no way out of that. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3110.56s)]
*  So austerity critically important and entrepreneurship. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3115.68s)]
*  I mean, when Bill Clinton left office, and I think Reagan through Clinton was the biggest 25 year [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3118.72s)]
*  period of economic boom we've ever had, federal spending as a percentage of GDP was 18 and a half [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3124.48s)]
*  percent. He got it down from like 22%. And he did it through economic growth. And he bragged about it. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3131.12s)]
*  Yep. So you know, look, where you want to be is I think, federal spending should be in the low 20s. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3136.96s)]
*  I think you want tax revenue to be in the high teens, 19%. You have a small deficit, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3144.56s)]
*  those are the conditions for economic growth. Jamath, any thoughts here on our way out? [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3150.32s)]
*  I'm going to take the complete opposite of all of this, which is the [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3156.8s)]
*  anti chicken little version, which is I think not much at all changes. I think that jet debt to GDP [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3159.84s)]
*  will continue to rise, not just for us, but for every other country in the world whose fate is [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3169.2000000000003s)]
*  worse than the United States. And I think that on a relative basis, the United States will continue [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3175.1200000000003s)]
*  to be exceptional. And that this will not really be an issue in our lifetimes. Okay. And I'm not [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3182.64s)]
*  saying that's a good thing. And I'm not saying that's a just thing. And I'm not saying that's [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3191.12s)]
*  what I want to happen. But pragmatically, I think that that's what will happen. And I don't think [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3195.7599999999998s)]
*  that there is a magic number where all of a sudden things start to break where there's some magic [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3202.48s)]
*  number for jet debt to GDP, where all of a sudden everybody finds religion. Instead, I think that [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3208.08s)]
*  it just creeps higher. And by the way, if you look at where debt to GDP was at the turn of the 19th [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3212.96s)]
*  century, and then what happened through the World War Two, what we've really done is, you know, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3218.16s)]
*  we've retraced a lot as well. So there have been moments where we've been out over our ski tips a [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3222.96s)]
*  lot. And so I think it's just important to keep in mind that sometimes what works just continues [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3227.7599999999998s)]
*  to work. And I keep asking myself the relative question, which is what country, what economy, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3235.92s)]
*  what group of human capital is better positioned in the United States. And despite all of the things [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3244.16s)]
*  that are screwed up with this country, it's hard to find a better example. So unless you happen to [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3249.6s)]
*  have the lucky mineral or oil club, like Norway or Saudi Arabia, you're, you're going to be hard [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3255.44s)]
*  pressed to find a better place to plant your money. And I think entrepreneurship and immigration are [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3263.36s)]
*  the two most important things we can do as well as austerity. And I think Joe Manchin is like, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3267.28s)]
*  or these moderate candidates in the middle who might actually be able to talk about cutting. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3272.8s)]
*  But by the way, you said something, you said something really interesting, which is if you [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3277.1200000000003s)]
*  look at Norway, Saudi, Abu Dhabi, what are those countries effectively becoming by monetizing the [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3280.48s)]
*  oil? They invest in all of the economies that are working. Perfect segue. Thank you. It's not as if [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3286.2400000000002s)]
*  the Saudis in Abu Dhabi and the Norwegians aren't trying to invest in America. They're trying to put [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3290.88s)]
*  as much money to work as possible. They're just trying to pace it out so that they have time [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3296.2400000000002s)]
*  diversity and asset diversity. So to your point, Jason, so this is a, it's sort of a bit of a [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3300.96s)]
*  self fulfilling prophecy. I think that what has worked continues to work. And then the burden [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3305.36s)]
*  for disruption gets higher and higher. That changes. There's two things that work in the world, [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3311.36s)]
*  having those natural resources or having entrepreneurship. Let's make a segue here. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3315.92s)]
*  Can I have the final point on that? Oh, God, we've been final pointing for 20 minutes here. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3320.88s)]
*  Go ahead. Quick final point. This is an important discussion, I think. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3323.84s)]
*  Okay. So Adam, Adam Smith once said that there's a great deal of ruin in a nation, meaning it takes [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3326.6400000000003s)]
*  a lot of political bungling to screw up something as big as a nation, especially a nation. That's [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3332.1600000000003s)]
*  the number one superpower in the world that has the world's reserve currency. So we are in some [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3337.6800000000003s)]
*  ways a beneficiary and coasting on hundreds of years of excellence of economic performance and [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3343.28s)]
*  great political leadership in this country. And the question to ask is not whether we can still [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3349.36s)]
*  coast on that, but whether the political leadership we have today is living up to the standard we had [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3356.1600000000003s)]
*  in the past. And I think it's clearly not. And the only question is when it breaks. And it's hard to [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3360.8s)]
*  predict exactly when it's going to break. But what I do believe is that if we keep going the way we're [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3366.6400000000003s)]
*  going, it, it will have to stop. Well said. We're definitely bending it right now. And when you bend [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3371.28s)]
*  it, sometimes it breaks. Right. And by the way, the reason why we are going to pursue AI at [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3376.32s)]
*  breakneck speed, even though it may lead to some sort of weird dystopian future is because we need [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3381.44s)]
*  that productivity boost. We have no choice now. And frankly, better us than the next guy. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3388.32s)]
*  Absolutely. Whoever gets their first wins. Another perfect segue. Two major stories this week [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3393.92s)]
*  that we need to discuss. The first is Saudi Arabia's public investment VC arm [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3400.96s)]
*  took a very interesting PR step of listing their funds that they have backed. And it's a significant [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3406.64s)]
*  list. Everybody from Andreessen Horowitz to KOTU. Not surprising there. And Mark Andreessen and Ben [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3413.3599999999997s)]
*  Horowitz and Adam Newman had a major keynote at a Saudi startup conference. I was actually asked to [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3421.36s)]
*  keynote the next one in Riyadh, which I'm debating doing. And then in sync with that happening, at [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3431.92s)]
*  the same time, there's been a debate of should LPs in America be backing firms like Sequoia China, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3439.2000000000003s)]
*  Matrix China, etc. Because those firms are now backing open AI competitors. And if we believe AI [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3448.88s)]
*  is the big race here, should we as a country, we don't, we're not allowed to back military stuff, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3457.6s)]
*  obviously, in these countries. But how do we on this global chessboard decide should we be taking [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3463.76s)]
*  money from Saudi? Should we be investing money in AI startups in China? So I think, Chamath, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3470.1600000000003s)]
*  you've got a big perspective here. Globally. Let's start with you. Two separate issues. Any surprises [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3476.3199999999997s)]
*  here by Saudi the kingdom actually releasing the list of who they're backing? And why would they [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3483.12s)]
*  do that at this point in time? And then us investing in China, because we are at a moment [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3487.4399999999996s)]
*  here a crossroads, I think, of should we be engaging or not engaging and building bridges [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3492.64s)]
*  with China and Saudi? You know, for obvious reasons. Look, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, all of [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3497.9199999999996s)]
*  the UAE, these are countries that are really important on the world stage, and increasingly [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3504.4s)]
*  so because they manage peace and prosperity regionally now, right? They have huge balance [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3509.44s)]
*  sheets that can accelerate all kinds of projects all around the world. And so they have to be [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3515.44s)]
*  taken seriously. And so this is a very smart marketing move by the PIF, which is to essentially [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3520.96s)]
*  say, Look, we are an established blue chip LP of the blue chip organizations that you're used to [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3527.44s)]
*  hearing about and celebrating. And I think that's very smart of them, because what it does is it [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3534.64s)]
*  reinforces the feedback loop that other great firms should be going to them to raise capital [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3540.2400000000002s)]
*  when it comes time for them to raise their n plus first fund. And so I suspect especially now, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3545.84s)]
*  it makes even more sense because everything we've heard Friedberg mentioned it a couple of episodes [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3552.48s)]
*  ago, the United States limited partner market is essentially closed for business, they have [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3556.64s)]
*  huge misallocation problems, the endowments are sort of closed, the universities are closed, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3562.64s)]
*  a lot of the family offices are licking their wounds. And so this is a perfect time for folks [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3567.3599999999997s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia and the UAE to basically put the foot on the gas and basically tell everybody, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3573.68s)]
*  hey, we are open for business. So I think that that makes a lot of sense. And I think that it'll [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3578.08s)]
*  be successful, it'll work, especially in a moment now where US dollar flows from US dollar [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3584.72s)]
*  limited partners are very difficult and harder to come by. Well, and we're also selling billions [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3589.52s)]
*  of dollars in weapons to the kingdom. And we are a major partner, valuable, they're a valuable [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3596.64s)]
*  security partner of the United States, they're valuable economic partner in the United States, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3602.64s)]
*  no different than doing business with any other country. I think it's smart by the PIF. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3606.3199999999997s)]
*  On the other thing, though, with US firms investing in Chinese AI, it should not be allowed. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3610.16s)]
*  And I do think that the folks that are responsible for CFIUS need to get a handle on this. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3614.48s)]
*  Look, I've done a bunch of deals where I have had to jump through a bunch of CFIUS hoops where [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3620.32s)]
*  explain surface please. So basically, CFIUS is the Committee on foreign investment in the United [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3626.72s)]
*  States. Now, what that means is, if folks want to invest in certain things that are on a list of [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3631.28s)]
*  things, and I'll tell you the things that I've been involved with that that came under CFIUS, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3636.56s)]
*  rocketry, and certain chip technologies are so advanced that the United States has very [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3640.4s)]
*  specific rules that limit the ability for foreign actors to invest in those businesses. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3646.8s)]
*  And in those situations where a few folks invested beside me in some of these companies, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3654.4s)]
*  we have to go through a process to get CFIUS approval before that investment was allowed. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3659.44s)]
*  Now, what's interesting about that is that's about money coming in. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3664.7200000000003s)]
*  But I do think that the reverse now becomes important because if US dollars are going [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3667.6s)]
*  to go and see these extremely complicated advanced technologies abroad, especially into the hands of [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3672.72s)]
*  countries that are frenemies at best of the United States, I think we have a responsibility to have a [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3680.0s)]
*  point of view on that. And so I think Keith Raboi was the one that was very definitive and said this [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3685.8399999999997s)]
*  should not be allowed. I do think it is so early, Jason, we talked about this, we're on this curve [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3690.96s)]
*  of fuck around and find out which means there will be some crazy examples of stuff that are very [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3695.2s)]
*  uncomfortable. Yep. I don't think we want US fingerprints on this stuff being perfected [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3700.3999999999996s)]
*  outside of US borders. Sachs, when we look at the history of engagement with China, maybe we can take [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3706.96s)]
*  a multi decade globalization perspective here. When you look back on it, the engagement with [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3712.8799999999997s)]
*  China created so much prosperity, so much intertwined, dependent on the US government, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3718.72s)]
*  and the interdependency, iPhones being the best example, possibly we're selling them in China, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3725.12s)]
*  we're making them in China. China loses Apple as a customer, that would be absolutely devastating [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3730.64s)]
*  for them. And it would obviously be devastating for Apple as well. So when we look back on that, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3737.8399999999997s)]
*  as a general rubric here, do you think we enabled a competitor? Or we avoided future conflict [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3742.48s)]
*  and where do you sit in terms of thinking about engagement versus maybe isolation or something [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3751.4399999999996s)]
*  in between those two, best of frenemies, etc. The policy of constructive engagement, as it was called [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3758.08s)]
*  20 something years ago, the idea behind it was that if we engage with China economically and help [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3764.16s)]
*  make them rich, then that they would become more like us. They would somehow turn into democracy [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3771.3599999999997s)]
*  and they would have tremendous gratitude towards us. And we become friends. It's not the way it [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3776.4s)]
*  worked out. There were people who warned that this was a foolish approach. So most notably, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3783.04s)]
*  the realist scholar, John Mearsheimer at the University of Chicago, warned back in 2002, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3788.4s)]
*  that that was not the way this was going to play out. If we made China rich, they would seek to [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3794.88s)]
*  convert that wealth into political power. And then they would act the way that all other great [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3799.2000000000003s)]
*  powers have behaved throughout human history, which is they want to dominate their region. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3805.04s)]
*  And they would seek to push the United States out of Asia. And the future that he predicted [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3810.24s)]
*  20 years ago is the future that's come true. And I think the you know, all the constructive [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3816.0s)]
*  engagers, I think, has some egg on their face. Now, I understand where they're coming from. This [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3819.7599999999998s)]
*  is a fundamental difference between whether you see the world in economic terms, which is about [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3824.56s)]
*  creating positive sum games, basically trade, or whether you see the world fundamentally in [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3829.84s)]
*  geopolitical terms, which is about the balance of power, which is more of a zero sum game. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3836.0s)]
*  And I think that both views, they're both extremely important. We want to engage in positive sum [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3840.8s)]
*  relationships that generate more trade and more wealth for the United States. At the same time, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3846.6400000000003s)]
*  we have to be aware and concerned about the balance of power. We do not want a number two country [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3851.04s)]
*  in the world who can rival the United States in terms of power, who basically could win a [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3858.32s)]
*  security competition with us. And we certainly don't want a country in the world to be more [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3863.44s)]
*  powerful than us. So I think this is sort of the yin and the yang is geopolitics versus economics. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3867.6s)]
*  And I think what's happened with China over the last several years is it's flipped. I think we [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3872.48s)]
*  used to see the relationship primarily in positive sum economic terms. And now we see it in [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3876.24s)]
*  geopolitical terms. And I think there's a lot of firms now in the United States who haven't [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3881.7599999999998s)]
*  embraced this new reality. And to go back to your question about when should a venture capital firm [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3888.3999999999996s)]
*  take money from a foreign country and when it shouldn't, I think there's a very simple [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3893.7599999999998s)]
*  rule for this, which is if the country is a US ally, I think it's fair game because the US has [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3898.48s)]
*  said this is a partner of ours, so why can't you do business with them? But if the United States [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3903.9199999999996s)]
*  government has said this is an adversary, you're putting yourself in a really difficult, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3908.08s)]
*  precarious spot by doing business with them. Because then you have to explain yourself to [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3912.88s)]
*  the US government. Yeah. This is the very simple rule we would use is we would never consider [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3917.04s)]
*  taking money from Russia or China. Any country that the US government says is an adversary of [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3921.52s)]
*  ours. But if the US government says this is a partner and an ally, then I think you can consider [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3928.96s)]
*  it. Do you think there's a way, Sachs, to salvage the relationship with China and make it productive? [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3933.04s)]
*  Or do you think it's a far gone conclusion at this point? Because one might argue, and I've [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3938.72s)]
*  heard people argue this, maybe China would have invaded Taiwan already if it wasn't for the [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3942.88s)]
*  interdependency. So I know we're dealing with, you know, a lot of, we're doing a lot of predictions [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3948.48s)]
*  here. But do you think it can be salvaged? And do you think it would have been a worse relationship [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3953.36s)]
*  if we hadn't had this interdependency that's been built up? I'm not quite sure that the economic [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3957.2s)]
*  interdependence theory preventing war has been definitively proven. If you go back to World War [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3962.56s)]
*  One, for example, it was the case that Britain and Germany actually were each other's number one [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3968.0s)]
*  trading partners, and they still got in World War One for reasons that in hindsight seem really silly. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3974.48s)]
*  So I'm not sure that economic interdependence can prevent, it certainly doesn't prevent security [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3980.24s)]
*  competitions from arising. And therefore, I don't think it can necessarily prevent a war. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3987.2s)]
*  Although, you know, having business ties can lead to positive interactions. So I'm just saying the [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3992.3199999999997s)]
*  jury's still out on that theory. But I think that, like I said, I think once you're in a security [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=3999.04s)]
*  competition, the way that we are with China, I think geopolitics rather than economics is in [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4004.72s)]
*  the driver's seat. And that's what's happening right now. Super easy, Friedberg, intellectually way, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4009.12s)]
*  I think to process this, you would never invest in a North Korean AI company, a Russian AI company, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4013.6s)]
*  or an Iranian AI company. How do you think about China? And then just generally this topic of when [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4020.16s)]
*  to engage, when venture capitalists, when startups, you know, and trade partners should engage with [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4026.48s)]
*  various countries? How do you think about it, Friedberg? In what role as an investor? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4034.16s)]
*  Well, we could we could take multiple roles here. Founder investor would be the top two for this [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4039.44s)]
*  program, I think. Or taking money from any of those three possibilities. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4043.92s)]
*  Very few portfolio companies that don't benefit some way from the trade relationship with China. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4049.52s)]
*  So, you know, to Sachs's point, I'm not sure you can really say China is a true and complete [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4056.96s)]
*  adversary in the sense that we're on opposite sides, there's obviously deep inter interdependencies. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4065.6s)]
*  So, you know, it's hard to kind of say, I draw the line that this kind of technology investing [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4070.64s)]
*  there, but I benefit from their technology investing that's going on there in other ways [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4076.3199999999997s)]
*  with some of my other businesses. Right? I think that that's really where you kind of run into a [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4081.04s)]
*  bit of a conundrum that we do have a deep interdependency. So, you know, like with respect [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4085.92s)]
*  to like investing in China, I don't know, I think the investing in China thing is pretty difficult, [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4094.56s)]
*  given that there is a single power that gets to decide what does or doesn't happen. I mean, [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4099.76s)]
*  look at what happened with Alibaba. A lot of shareholders got pretty wiped out there. These [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4105.2s)]
*  governments where you have like the the potential of getting completely wiped out by government [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4112.16s)]
*  action is a pretty scary place to invest in general. I'd be more oriented as an investor [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4117.36s)]
*  around those concerns than I am about, you know, it's really hard to do the calculus on am I helping [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4122.08s)]
*  or hurting America versus China. You know, you could argue 100 ways each of those sides. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4127.68s)]
*  Well, what do you think of Sachs's framework? If we're partners, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4134.64s)]
*  you know, fair game, if not partners, not a good idea to put your neck out. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4138.96s)]
*  But we're part sorry, are you asking are you saying like we're not partners with China? [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4143.68s)]
*  Well, it seems like the US government has said we're adversaries now, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4147.84s)]
*  and that we're in a pretty dogged competition. Well, Jake, I'll just be specific. I'm talking [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4152.4800000000005s)]
*  about a situation in which you're taking money from them. Yes, in a situation where taking money. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4156.72s)]
*  I do think that selling them products that are, you know, not like super strategic, like I think [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4161.12s)]
*  selling them our most advanced chips is dangerous. But, you know, look, I think if you're selling [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4169.04s)]
*  them products that help restore the trade deficit and correct that movie, I don't have a problem [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4174.0s)]
*  with that. Yeah, I don't have a problem with selling movies or cars or something like that to [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4178.72s)]
*  China. The question is, though, I think if you're a venture capital firm, do you take their money? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4183.36s)]
*  That's what I'm specifically talking about. And I think whether you're allowed to or not, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4187.5199999999995s)]
*  we don't because we just don't have to think about what complications that could cause down the road. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4191.92s)]
*  Also getting your money out of China also a difficult task, it seems these days. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4199.2s)]
*  Cash app creator Bob Lee, aka Crazy Bob on Twitter, that was his Twitter handle was stabbed to death [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4202.799999999999s)]
*  tragically in San Francisco earlier this week. He was Square's first CTO. He worked at Google, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4208.5599999999995s)]
*  on Android. He was the chief product officer at Mobilecoin, also an angel investor in a ton of [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4214.48s)]
*  companies, Figma, SpaceX, Clubhouse, well known in the industry. Officers responded at about 2.35am [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4220.48s)]
*  to report of a stabbing on the 300 block of Main Street and arrived to find Lee who had been taken [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4226.799999999999s)]
*  to a hospital and succumbed to his injuries there. No arrest has been made. A lot of San Francisco [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4234.72s)]
*  politicians are sending their thoughts and prayers, but obviously, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4242.96s)]
*  San Francisco is still a very dangerous place, it seems. Any thoughts on this and how it might [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4246.56s)]
*  act as some sort of crossroads or not? And thoughts and prayers obviously to his family. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4253.92s)]
*  Look, I think this was a pretty tragic event. There's a lot of people who I knew that were [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4260.24s)]
*  pretty close with him. I got several messages on his passing. I didn't know him personally. I think [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4267.599999999999s)]
*  we met maybe once or twice. He worked on Android at Google and obviously had a key role at Square [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4273.28s)]
*  in the early days and was a pretty impactful and important person, but also supposedly, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4278.4s)]
*  I didn't know him very well again, but everyone says just such an incredibly kind and generous [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4283.5199999999995s)]
*  person. So tragic loss. I used to live two blocks from where the event happened. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4287.6s)]
*  I'll zoom out. Where is it, Freeberg? Is it a bad place? It's in Soma, that Rincon Center, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4294.88s)]
*  right by the big condo towers there and that's right where the Salesforce offices used to be. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4300.64s)]
*  And you know, block from the waterfront. Is it part of all that drug craziness? No, [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4306.160000000001s)]
*  not necessarily. It's not in the heart of the camping district. It's just a nice [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4313.28s)]
*  area in Soma, quiet area, right? So at night there's no one there. I went to San Francisco [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4317.679999999999s)]
*  a few weeks ago. I told you guys, I pulled up to a restaurant on the Embarcadero and I joked with [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4321.5199999999995s)]
*  my buddy in the car. I'm like, Oh, my car is going to get broken into while we're at dinner [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4325.679999999999s)]
*  because I'm parking on the street. We went to dinner 90 minutes later, came out. Of course, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4328.88s)]
*  my car had been broken into the trunk had been popped up and it's just like, this is the fancy [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4332.24s)]
*  area of Soma, Chamath, very fancy area of Soma. Look, here's the thing. If you park at a parking [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4336.32s)]
*  meter in San Francisco for eight minutes too long, you get a 60 to a hundred dollar parking [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4340.96s)]
*  ticket. And San Francisco has become an upside-down town. What I mean by that is I think that like [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4345.28s)]
*  so much of the response that we've had in the last couple of years to power dynamics and concerns [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4351.76s)]
*  about the powerful having too much influence over those who are less powerful, who have less [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4358.16s)]
*  influence and who suffer as a result of their demeaned influence. The response has been to [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4364.32s)]
*  turn things upside down, which is to give those who were lacking in the power structure, everything [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4370.72s)]
*  and to try and take everything away from those who are at the top of the power structure. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4376.4800000000005s)]
*  So if you want to deal drugs in the open air, if you want to walk into Walgreens and steal [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4380.08s)]
*  thousands of dollars of goods and walk out, nothing will happen to you because you were [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4384.240000000001s)]
*  embedded with this powerless kind of position in life. But if you have a car and you park at a [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4388.88s)]
*  parking meter and you say at the parking meter for more than 10 minutes, you get a ticket. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4394.56s)]
*  And the consequences of responding to power dynamics by flipping the power structure upside down [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4398.72s)]
*  is obviously can be more negative as we're kind of experiencing, I think, acutely in San Francisco, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4404.320000000001s)]
*  but also around the nation. And by the way, I think that this applies in a lot of other ways in [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4410.0s)]
*  terms of how we're doing college admissions, in terms of how we're selecting people for jobs, [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4413.76s)]
*  in terms of recent applications for pilots, for doctors, where the assessment is less about [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4418.56s)]
*  did the person who was disadvantaged at the beginning of their life or career or trajectory [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4426.96s)]
*  or educational path be given greater opportunity and greater resources to catch up and to get there? [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4432.16s)]
*  Or did we just flip the power dynamic upside down and just give them the end point? [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4439.44s)]
*  And as a result, there's a massive kind of detriment that I think can arise. And it's not [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4443.679999999999s)]
*  necessarily always the case that it will arise. It is not necessarily the case that selecting [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4448.32s)]
*  someone based on some demographic profiling to be an airline pilot necessarily means that that [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4453.28s)]
*  airline is more likely to have airplane crashes. But in certain cases, when you don't prosecute [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4458.5599999999995s)]
*  certain crimes, like robberies, or people walking into stores or breaking windows or dealing drugs [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4463.84s)]
*  in the middle of the street or camping on the street, and you fast forward a couple of years, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4471.2s)]
*  that power dynamic, the flip of that power dynamic causes the whole town to go upside down. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4475.599999999999s)]
*  And everyone who's sitting on the bottom ends up becoming a victim themselves. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4480.48s)]
*  And I think we're starting to see inklings of this in San Francisco, we certainly have for years, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4483.679999999999s)]
*  Sachs has ranted on about this, with respect to some of the non prosecution that's happened [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4487.5199999999995s)]
*  historically. And I totally agree with him on those points. And I think that it's come to a [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4491.44s)]
*  breaking point in San Francisco, but that's really a beacon for what else is going on. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4496.08s)]
*  And you know, some people call it wokeism. I think maybe this notion of wokeism is one small [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4500.48s)]
*  element or segment of the broader issue with how we are tackling with and dealing with embedded [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4505.44s)]
*  power structure issues in this world today. And the flipping of those power structures upside down [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4511.04s)]
*  doesn't necessarily yield the outcome we all want. And I think we're starting to see reasons why. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4516.5599999999995s)]
*  Aaron Norris Sachs, any thoughts here? [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4520.719999999999s)]
*  Sachs That's my rant. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4522.0s)]
*  Aaron Norris I can't disagree with you. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4522.719999999999s)]
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, so similar to Freeberg, I didn't know [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4524.32s)]
*  Bob Lee, but I know many people who knew him and I was getting texts and obviously, we feel [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4526.639999999999s)]
*  really bad for him, his whole family, his kids, his father, his co-workers, friends. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4531.68s)]
*  We don't know exactly what happened yet, but I think we suspect and I would bet [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4537.92s)]
*  dollars to dimes that this story is very similar to a case we had in LA recently, [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4542.400000000001s)]
*  the Brianna Kupfer case, where a young woman was basically stabbed for no reason by a psychotic [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4546.72s)]
*  homeless person who had been through the revolving door of the jail and criminal justice system, [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4552.64s)]
*  who could have been locked up, who was arrested multiple times, but was not kept locked up because [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4557.92s)]
*  of this push for decarceration. And you can argue that maybe it'd be better for that person to be [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4562.72s)]
*  in mandatory treatment or in even maybe a mental asylum. But this idea of just releasing these [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4567.6s)]
*  people onto the street, I just think is an outrageous abdication of responsibility by [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4573.2s)]
*  our elected officials who run the criminal justice system, who pass our laws. And the thing I just [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4579.84s)]
*  wish is that I could lock for 24 hours the people like our supervisors or our governor [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4585.36s)]
*  or the people who basically make these laws or the people who are pushing for decarceration of [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4593.599999999999s)]
*  these violent offenders by these nonprofits. I wish I could lock them up in a room for 24 hours [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4598.24s)]
*  with the people that they think are safe to release on our streets. Let's see if they really [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4604.799999999999s)]
*  would take that test because it seems to me that these elected leaders and these nonprofits who [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4611.76s)]
*  are pushing for these outcomes, they are setting loose on us a predatory criminal or psychotic [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4618.320000000001s)]
*  element that jeopardizes our safety and makes these cities unlivable. And we should not tolerate [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4626.400000000001s)]
*  that. And quite frankly, the responsibility goes beyond those elected leaders. It goes to all the [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4632.08s)]
*  voters as well because we keep putting up with this. And where was our governor when this happened? [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4637.04s)]
*  He was in Florida doing some sing-along at some high school where he was trolling Ron DeSantis [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4641.76s)]
*  because DeSantis had taken on DEI at that school. So that's where Newsom was and he's extremely [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4648.56s)]
*  popular in California. Fighting culture wars instead of saving people. Fighting culture wars in a distant [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4653.92s)]
*  state instead of basically fixing the criminal justice system in California. It's even worse [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4658.24s)]
*  than that because he's actually shut down two prisons and released lots of people. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4664.0s)]
*  So where is the push for criminal justice reform in California in protecting the citizenry? And until [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4667.36s)]
*  the voters in San Francisco and California start demanding this, there's never going to be a change. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4674.08s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell And at the same time, [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4678.64s)]
*  Chammath— [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4679.92s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell So start listening to Gary Tan. Just vote for who the [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4680.64s)]

*  Aaron Ross Powell I think it's a probably good—I can't disagree and the supervisors seem to control [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4685.28s)]
*  a lot of this and Chammath shared just this week, Mayor Francis Suarez is talking about on his [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4690.56s)]
*  Twitter the reduction in homicide, shootings, and they have literally counted the—if you want to [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4697.04s)]
*  say drug addicted, mentally ill, homeless, there's obviously three or four different things going on [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4705.6s)]
*  here when you look at the population that's living on the street. Some number of them down on their [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4711.120000000001s)]
*  luck, some number mentally ill, some number addicted to drugs, and some number a combination [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4715.76s)]
*  of those things. He seems to be getting it done in Miami and, you know, other states seem to and [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4720.0s)]
*  other cities seem to have gotten this under control. Is there any hope for San Francisco, [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4727.12s)]
*  Chammath, or is this just going to take five or 10 years to bottom out? [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4730.8s)]
*  Chammath Nair I mean, it takes regime change. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4734.16s)]
*  I think New York had a long period of lawlessness where people were afraid to walk down the streets. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4737.12s)]
*  It took a handful of mayors to draw a hard line in the sand to increase policing, [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4743.12s)]
*  sometimes to introduce some pretty controversial concepts at the time, or at the time that were [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4748.72s)]
*  supported, which now seem controversial. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4752.88s)]
*  You're talking about stop, ask, and frisk. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4754.64s)]
*  I think it was called the broken windows theory of policing. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4756.56s)]
*  Yep, take care of the little things. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4759.12s)]
*  Where, take care of the little things so that the little things don't compound into the big things. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4760.56s)]
*  But whatever you believe needs to get done, I think it's pretty clear that what is being done [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4766.240000000001s)]
*  isn't working. And so the real question is, can people see through the naked partisanship to agree [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4772.48s)]
*  that this is not working? And sadly, what I would tell you guys is that I don't think [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4779.919999999999s)]
*  they're there yet. And the reason is because America is the most divided it's ever been, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4787.2s)]
*  especially on issues of race and social justice and social norms. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4793.599999999999s)]
*  And I think that crime has gotten caught and painted with that brush, which means that the idea of very [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4800.56s)]
*  aggressive policing and safety are now viewed as opposite and antithetical to social justice. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4810.32s)]
*  And I don't know how that happened, but the result of it is this, which is these folks will never [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4819.6s)]
*  agree that this is not working. And I think that's the reason why I think that's the reason why [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4824.4s)]
*  and you'll have to go through recall election after recall election. And even then it's not [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4829.759999999999s)]
*  going to be enough because the smart politicians will say what they want in terms of like, [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4834.96s)]
*  safety matters. But then a lot of voters will vote the opposite. The example in Chicago that [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4843.599999999999s)]
*  David brought up earlier is really interesting because it was essentially a social justice [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4849.679999999999s)]
*  candidate versus a law and order candidate through their democratic ranks. And the social [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4854.08s)]
*  justice candidate won the progressive candidate one and the person that wanted to tax businesses [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4859.36s)]
*  and individuals one and the person that wanted to sort of focus on law and order lost. So what does [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4866.8s)]
*  that say? It says that we are still in a moment where we can't agree on what is important. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4873.36s)]
*  Yep, that's really scary. And so I think you kind of have to unfortunately vote with your feet if [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4878.8s)]
*  you are lucky enough to do so. And then the key Yeah, who's left over or a lot of people who are [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4884.4s)]
*  not in a position to just up and leave. And then they are unfortunately left behind. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4891.12s)]
*  Tragic situation all around. And I will never host a conference or any event in San Francisco [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4897.44s)]
*  until this is solved. Because I am when people ask us to do events, I'm like, people don't want [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4905.36s)]
*  to come to San Francisco, they're afraid. So I do my events in Napa, or in San Mateo, not not [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4910.88s)]
*  started a bilingual school, Italian English that is on the IB system, International Baccalaureate [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4915.44s)]
*  System. And it's a sister school to a school in the city, we had a fundraiser, which was literally [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4921.44s)]
*  right downtown in that encampment area. And when I pulled up, I was like, is this for real? It's [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4926.88s)]
*  an open air drug market, where folks are doing drugs, selling drugs right in front of you. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4934.08s)]
*  They're passed out completely incapacitated, about a third of the guys are wearing balaclavas. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4941.12s)]
*  So you can't identify them, you have no idea what they look like. I grew up in Brooklyn in the 70s [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4946.5599999999995s)]
*  and 80s, when it was legit dangerous. And when I walk in San Francisco, it feels much more dangerous. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4950.96s)]
*  And then the that crazy era, it feels random, it doesn't feel like there's organized crime, gang [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4959.4400000000005s)]
*  crime, like I grew up in a pretty crappy neighborhood. And you knew who the gangs were, [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4966.320000000001s)]
*  you knew who the tough guys were, you knew how to avoid trouble, they didn't come and randomly [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4970.96s)]
*  come and stab you to death. Right? And so yeah, Jason, you become street smart growing up in a [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4975.76s)]
*  culture like that, because you know how to avoid it, you know how to be alert, this doesn't feel [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4980.8s)]
*  like that. This is just like a bad roll of the dice, and you could get stabbed to death just [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4984.88s)]
*  walking down the street that does not. Where Where are the politicians to stop this? [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4990.4s)]
*  I mean, they don't care. There's the level of corruption in San Francisco is unbelievable, [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=4996.96s)]
*  the incompetence amongst those supervisors, the mayor, the DA is everybody, it's just incompetence, [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5001.679999999999s)]
*  and nobody has the chutzpah, the wherewithal to say enough. And I think the other group to blame [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5008.48s)]
*  are all the rich people and powerful people who just haven't been active in politics. And I know [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5015.679999999999s)]
*  some of us have in different ways. But I think it's going to take a coordinated effort by people [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5020.4s)]
*  who really care to vote out all these supervisors and bring in it's got to be regime change. And I [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5026.0s)]
*  just don't know if there's the wherewithal to do because every time as a person who has some means [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5031.5199999999995s)]
*  or is successful in some way that you stick your neck out there like you have done, sacks, [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5036.4s)]
*  the the attacks that you will get from this insane left. I don't want to even use the word woke, [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5041.04s)]
*  I think it's a different derangement. I think it's actual corruption where they're making so much [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5047.5199999999995s)]
*  money off of this homeless industrial complex. They're getting paid so much money that the [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5052.24s)]
*  grift is so deep that they are going to fight for this. And it's going to take some really courageous [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5056.879999999999s)]
*  people like Gary Tan and maybe David Sachs and other folks to back a slate of people [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5062.32s)]
*  to change this and we need people to run for government who are brave and who want to put [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5069.5199999999995s)]
*  their neck out there and say enough is enough. We're going to police the city. I just don't know if [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5074.48s)]
*  it is going to happen. All right, listen. Yeah, I mean, the issue is that it takes it takes more [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5078.639999999999s)]
*  than one election. So listen, I think we made a positive change by removing Chesa Boudin. I think [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5082.96s)]
*  Brooke Jenkins has the right attitude. She cares about victims. I think she wants to prosecute. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5087.76s)]
*  The issue is that you've got a police department that's 50 percent of the number [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5093.84s)]
*  of officers that they want because they flirted with this whole defund the police movement. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5098.64s)]
*  You've got the Board of Supervisors and you've got like an oversight board on the police that [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5103.04s)]
*  basically make their jobs harder. And it's not it's not one election because even the mayor doesn't [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5107.360000000001s)]
*  control it because the Board of Supervisors really has all the power in San Francisco. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5112.0s)]
*  So they take a job that really should be one or two people's jobs like the D.A., like the mayor, [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5116.32s)]
*  and they break it up into this like Board of Supervisors where you've now got to be familiar [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5121.36s)]
*  with a dozen different races in order to effectuate a change. Well, the machine knows how to do that, [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5127.759999999999s)]
*  but the average citizen doesn't. So they make it really hard to effectuate change. But there [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5134.5599999999995s)]
*  are groups that are springing up in San Francisco like Grow SF and, you know, people like Gary [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5139.36s)]
*  who are on top of it. And that's why just follow them and vote for their recommendations [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5145.52s)]
*  because they're actually cracking how to make a difference. All right. I think on that we will [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5150.56s)]
*  wrap for the dictator Chamath Palihapitiya, the Rayman David Sacks, and the Sultan of Science, [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5156.0s)]
*  for a Vita Friedberg. I am the world's greatest moderator. We'll see you at the All In Summit. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5162.64s)]
*  I'm doing all in. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2tYNhq5J8&t=5222.64s)]
