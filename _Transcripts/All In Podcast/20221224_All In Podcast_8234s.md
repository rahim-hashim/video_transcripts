# E109 2022 Bestie Awards Live from Twitter HQ
**All In Podcast:** [December 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0)
*  Hey, everybody. Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. It is the end of 2022. And once again, we're [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=0.0s)]
*  doing our bestie awards. Yes, at the end of the year, we do our bestie awards. This is [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6.98s)]
*  where we give awards to the biggest winners, losers and many other categories that you [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  love with me again. Of course, the Sultan of science deep in his Kurosawa vibes. How [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=17.92s)]
*  are you doing Sultan? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=25.0s)]
*  It was great to see you guys for dinner last night. Sax, we missed you. That was a lot [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=26.0s)]
*  of fun. We all got together twice this week for dinner while we were on vacation. And [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=29.6s)]
*  during our dinner, we took a vote and Sax, you are now the director of the All In Summit. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=35.6s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=39.92s)]
*  Yes, congratulations. Yes, the grift is on. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=40.92s)]
*  My first act is to veto it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=42.72s)]
*  Okay, sorry to the fans. Also with us, of course, is the dictator himself Chamath Palihapitiya [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=44.96s)]
*  and his vibes. Tell us about your winter vibes, bestie. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=56.04s)]
*  I mean, I can't believe that we all took over Lake Tahoe for a week together. It's cool. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=61.28s)]
*  It's been a lot of fun. I got to say, Sax, you'll be surprised. J Cal has the life hack [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=67.52s)]
*  of life hacks here. He's figured out how to basically get everything pre wired. All the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=72.58s)]
*  restaurants, all the reservations. It's been great. I've loved it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=78.64s)]
*  We've had a wonderful time. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=81.48s)]
*  It's an eight person table for every night. And he does it what months in advance. So [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=82.56s)]
*  every night he's got an object. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=86.64s)]
*  About two weeks out. Every two weeks out, I get a table of eight for five, six nights [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=87.64s)]
*  in a row. And then I invite my besties out. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=91.72s)]
*  And oddly, it turned out there was only one person from J Cal's side, just himself. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=93.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=97.76s)]
*  There was always room for the rest of us to show up. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=98.76s)]
*  We had a wonderful time. I picked up the check for the nachos and Chamath brought $6,000 [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=101.64s)]
*  worth of wine. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=107.92s)]
*  I brought my own also to the restaurant yesterday so we could open the wine properly. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=109.36s)]
*  It was wonderful. We've had a wonderful time. And of course, with us looks like he had to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=114.12s)]
*  work over the Christmas break. Sax, how are you doing, brother? You working today? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=118.64s)]
*  I'm good. I'm just hanging out somewhere. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=123.8s)]
*  Well, come on, you can be honest. You're at the Twitter HQ. I recognize that incredible [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=127.08s)]
*  architecture and design. They spent so much money on that office space. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=132.12s)]
*  Beautiful office. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=135.88s)]
*  Definitely beautiful office. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=136.88s)]
*  They've got their own bespoke coffee shop here called The Perch. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=139.0s)]
*  We're the people that work there. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=143.76s)]
*  Too soon. Too soon. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=145.24s)]
*  The people are working too hard to be hanging out in the coffee shop. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=148.24s)]
*  Okay, so let's get started with our bestie awards. This is very controversial. We start [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=167.24s)]
*  with a political award. And last year, you know, this is our just so we're clear, this [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  is not the prediction show. The next week will be the prediction show. This week is [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=179.32s)]
*  our winners. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=183.5s)]
*  Cue the music. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=184.5s)]
*  Yes, cue the music. Right there. Okay, here we go. 2022 predictions. This is what we predicted [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=185.5s)]
*  for the bestie award for biggest political winner. I said Ron DeSantis and so did David [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=192.64s)]
*  Sacks. We predicted in 2022. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=199.46s)]
*  You said it after me. You said it after me. And the way you introduced it, you said, what [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=201.0s)]
*  did Tucker Carlson's writers come up with? I said DeSantis and then you said DeSantis. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=205.76s)]
*  Are you starting already? Literally, I'm trying to give you your flowers. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=210.36s)]
*  No, I reviewed the tape. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=213.36s)]
*  Okay, take it easy. You're going to get your flowers. So Ron DeSantis, obviously a big [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=214.36s)]
*  winner. So those were those were great predictions. Freberg with a wild card there, he predicted [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=220.64s)]
*  Putin would be a winner in 2022. That one fell a little flat. Did it not our friend [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=226.55999999999997s)]
*  Freberg? Not a winner. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=230.83999999999997s)]
*  No, I think he, you know, I mean, my projection was really built on what I thought would be [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=232.27999999999997s)]
*  a big kind of influence that he would gain this year. You know, whether he's viewed negatively [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=237.56s)]
*  or positively, he's certainly at the center of the stage right now. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  Now Chamath, your 22 prediction, this is your prediction last year for this year, was that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=244.11999999999998s)]
*  the biggest political winner would be Xi Jinping. Okay, now we go to our actual biggest winner. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=249.6s)]
*  This is where we tell you who we thought was the biggest winner of 2022. Let's start with [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=256.6s)]
*  you, Sax. Who is your biggest winner for 2022? Political biggest winner. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=261.68s)]
*  This was the prediction that I nailed as you mentioned it. So the red wave fizzled everywhere [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  else, but it crashed over Florida hard. So DeSantis is my pick. He won re-election by [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=272.44s)]
*  20 points and his co-tails carried four new GOP house seats, which happens to be the exact [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=278.22s)]
*  size of the GOP majority. Several polls have now shown him beating Donald Trump by significant [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=283.26s)]
*  margins for the 2024 GOP nomination. He is shattering fundraising records. Florida is [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=289.14000000000004s)]
*  now the fastest growing state. So he is my pick for the biggest winner, political winner [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=294.58000000000004s)]
*  of 2022. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=300.42s)]
*  So who is your biggest political winner? Chamath. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=302.42s)]
*  I mean, it's obvious it's Xi Jinping. You know, there is no single person in the world [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=307.18s)]
*  that is now as powerful as this one man. He has complete authoritarian control over 1.2 [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=314.62s)]
*  odd billion people and 20% of the world's GDP and a large amount of the world's debt, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=323.62s)]
*  including a lot of US dollar debt. And so, you know, it's pretty, there's, there's, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=330.82s)]
*  it's hard to find anybody that won nearly as much as he did. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=337.94s)]
*  Okay, now to you, Friedberg. Who is your biggest political winner of 2022? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=341.46s)]
*  I mean, I think your DeSantis and Xi Jinping calls were really like good. I think the biggest [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=347.34s)]
*  surprising winner for me is like, you know, unexpected. And that would be Zelensky from [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=355.15999999999997s)]
*  the Ukraine. I don't think going into this year, people paid as much attention to him. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=361.47999999999996s)]
*  He was certainly not a sung hero, but coming through this conflict, and I think leading [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  the storyline about our common enemy of the West and common enemy of democracy being Vladimir [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=371.91999999999996s)]
*  Putin really kind of made him a superstar and a hero on a global stage. And I think [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=378.59999999999997s)]
*  that's evidenced by the fact that he was in the White House, and he gave an address [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=384.24s)]
*  to the US Congress yesterday. So I would make him kind of the biggest winner of the year. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=386.92s)]
*  It's hard to go against DeSantis. So, you know, he clearly has, as Sachs correctly pointed [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=391.06s)]
*  out, gone into the lead. We'll see if he can be Trump in the primaries. I have my doubts, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=398.48s)]
*  but he does seem to be pulling in some of those moderates, right? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=403.44s)]
*  I don't understand why you guys say he's a political winner. What did he win? He hasn't [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=407.84000000000003s)]
*  the nomination yet. He got re-elected to a state that he had before 2022. So what did [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=411.72s)]
*  he win exactly? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=417.96s)]
*  Well, I think a couple of things. One is when he won election to the governorship four years [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=418.96s)]
*  ago, it was by less than 1%. It was a tiny margin of victory. This was margin of almost [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=423.96s)]
*  20%. He had coattails, and he is now the front runner for the GOP nomination in 24. I think [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=429.72s)]
*  you can argue, you can make the case that maybe he's peaking too soon. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=435.52s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you brought that up, because if you look at the data, you know, I think [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=438.56s)]
*  in the last seven or eight nomination cycles, the person that's been leading the popularity [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=443.44s)]
*  contest going into the Iowa caucuses has not won the nomination. He's peaking too soon [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=449.64s)]
*  almost. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=454.12s)]
*  That's a possibility, because when you're the front runner, everyone takes shots of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=455.12s)]
*  you. On the other hand, if he stays this dominant, he will drive out other contenders out of [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=458.08s)]
*  the primary, and he may be able to solidify it. And if it can just be DeSantis versus [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=465.6s)]
*  Trump in the primary, he has stands a much better shot than if it's Trump versus a bunch [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=470.24s)]
*  of other challengers. And I think that if he continues to pull this well within the [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=473.88s)]
*  Republican Party, I think Trump might not run again, because Trump definitely does not [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=479.76000000000005s)]
*  want to risk being a loser in the Republican primary. So yeah, there's always front runner [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=483.88s)]
*  risks, but it's hard to say that coming out of this year that he wasn't a huge political [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=488.32000000000005s)]
*  winner. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=493.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=494.48s)]
*  I would maybe challenge Zelensky. There's no question that he's been a global media [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=496.36s)]
*  hero, but two-thirds of Kyiv is currently without power. 80% of Kyiv doesn't have water. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=501.20000000000005s)]
*  30% of the Ukrainian power stations have been destroyed. Nearly half of the country is without [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=507.20000000000005s)]
*  power. There's something like 8 million displaced Ukrainians in the country, and over 100,000 [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=511.0s)]
*  Ukrainians have been killed in this war. So yes, he's been a very strong, charismatic [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=520.84s)]
*  war leader for them, but- [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=524.44s)]
*  Friedberg, your response? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=526.36s)]
*  I'm not advocating for his performance as a leader. I'm advocating for his accumulation [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=527.36s)]
*  of political goodwill. And that's it. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=536.2s)]
*  Okay. And he is winning the war. So- [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=538.76s)]
*  I don't know if that's true, but is that winning? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=541.5600000000001s)]
*  Well in war, they say nobody wins, but it's certainly better than having your country [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=545.16s)]
*  taken over by Putin. So some would argue that's winning. Let's go to biggest losers. Biggest [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=549.32s)]
*  losers. In 2022, we predicted- again, this is our predictions from last year, and then [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=554.32s)]
*  we'll go on to our actuals for this year. Last year we predicted Chamath said the progressive [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=559.9200000000001s)]
*  left. Sacks said Nancy Pelosi. Friedberg, you said US influence globally. Interesting. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=565.44s)]
*  And I said the extremes, both Biden and Trump. Let's go with our predictions. I'm sorry, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=570.88s)]
*  with our actuals for this year. Chamath, why don't you go first this time? Who is your [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=576.08s)]
*  biggest political loser for 2022? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=580.08s)]
*  I mean, I don't think it's as written about as much, but the progressive left did see [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=582.88s)]
*  as much failure as the MAGA right. So they were a huge loser. I mean, to the extent that [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=589.68s)]
*  anybody thought that leftist, you know, quasi socialist policies and politics was a winning [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=596.24s)]
*  strategy, I think that was pretty soundly refuted. Even in places that were pretty staunchly [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=601.84s)]
*  Democrat, it was really difficult for the progressive left to do much of anything but [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=607.36s)]
*  lose. So I think that was a really powerful and important repudiation. And I think it [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=612.4s)]
*  marginalizes them to a bunch of, you know, kooks almost. And I think that that's really [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=618.96s)]
*  healthy for politics going forward. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=625.84s)]
*  So your prediction and your actual are going to be the same than the progressive left? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=627.52s)]
*  I think they were the biggest political loser in the United States, at least. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=631.76s)]
*  Okay, yeah, Elizabeth Warren, we don't hear people talking about Elizabeth Warren or Bernie [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=634.96s)]
*  Sanders much this year. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=638.72s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that the biggest political loser outside of the United States was probably [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=639.6s)]
*  the European Union. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=644.48s)]
*  Okay, you want to expand on that a little bit? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=645.6800000000001s)]
*  If you just think about the corner that they painted themselves into, how much they had to [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=647.0400000000001s)]
*  basically literally go 180 degrees away from what their policies were, you know, there was a huge [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=652.96s)]
*  raft of whether it was green, ESG, kind of woke liberal politics that manifested itself in all [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=659.68s)]
*  kinds of national security decisions and energy decisions that in this last year, they literally [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=667.12s)]
*  had to undo in order to stay alive. And that makes that whole political construct, I think, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=672.0s)]
*  very fragile. So they were they were a pretty big political loser outside of the United States. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=679.12s)]
*  Okay, Sax, can be hard here to guess this one. But Sax, who is your biggest political loser in [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=684.16s)]
*  2022? I have no idea who you're going to pick here. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=692.88s)]
*  By the way, I got Pelosi right last year that she did lose the gavel. So you've got to say that the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=695.28s)]
*  war in Ukraine was the biggest event of the year. And obviously, you can spread the blame around to [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=700.16s)]
*  a lot of people starting with Putin, because he's one who ordered the invasion. But I would say this [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=705.8399999999999s)]
*  is a slightly different take on the category, which is biggest political blunder occurred on [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=710.32s)]
*  January 27th of this year, when Blinken said that NATO's door is open and must remain open. And that [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=714.4000000000001s)]
*  is our commitment. He basically shut the door. He kept NATO's door open, but shut the door on any [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=722.48s)]
*  means of a diplomatic off ramp to end this conflict by promising Russia, the Ukraine would [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=727.84s)]
*  not become part of NATO. That was the single biggest diplomatic blunder of this year, or maybe [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=732.4000000000001s)]
*  the last couple of decades, because there's a good chance we could have avoided this disastrous war [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=738.24s)]
*  if we had just been willing to close NATO's door. Wonderful. Great, crisp answer. Thank you for that. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=743.76s)]
*  Nice and tight. Friedberg, who's your biggest political loser for 2022? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=748.08s)]
*  It was a tie for me between Jerome Powell and Liz Truss. Liz Truss just has to get recognition [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=752.64s)]
*  here for only being in office for 45 days as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. I mean, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=759.44s)]
*  I think that cannot be overlooked. Some of the policy and folks that she put in [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=764.48s)]
*  office caused massive chaos. It was just a clear dysfunction over a very short period of time. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=772.32s)]
*  Jerome Powell, I think this was a big surprise this year to see how the Fed Chair became [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=779.6s)]
*  so politicized and his role became so politicized, both the left and the right finding reasons to [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=786.56s)]
*  question his leadership and his decision making. The failure to raise rates soon enough led to [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=795.28s)]
*  massive inflation is what you'll hear from one contingent of politicians and the public at large. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=803.1999999999999s)]
*  And then the rate at which he's raising rates now to catch up to the and to calm inflation is causing [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=808.0s)]
*  people to complain on the other side. So there is really no one that seems to be happy with [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=814.8s)]
*  Jerome Powell. And I think that that was a shooting star that seems to have completely [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=818.24s)]
*  lost its luster. Okay, so the Fed. Yes, good poll there. Okay, mine is pretty clear. And objectively, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=823.04s)]
*  it is of course, the GOP, the red wave failed, it turned into a trickle. Trump is back. And I [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=828.4s)]
*  believe there's a good chance he will win the primary Roe v Wade, a complete unmitigated [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=835.4399999999999s)]
*  disaster for Republicans, they caught the car and plus marriage equality and having to deal with [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=840.56s)]
*  that women and the LGBT community vote and they have long memories. The GOP the biggest political [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=848.0799999999999s)]
*  losers for me. Okay, I'm sure sex has no rebuttal there. So we will move on to the next category, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=855.1199999999999s)]
*  which is, by the way, if you say it that way, then you know, the biggest political loser in [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=862.0799999999999s)]
*  2022 were women look like fundamental human rights were stripped away from 50% of the population. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=867.76s)]
*  So that's not cool. And they could have left it alone. And they could have left it. Well, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=875.12s)]
*  if if what you mean is that the issue was sent to the states and each state then gets to decide, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=880.72s)]
*  then you're right. But but if you look at the battles have happened at the states, even red [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=886.72s)]
*  states like Kentucky and Kansas have rejected the subsequent political push to outlaw abortion. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=891.04s)]
*  So it has not turned out to be just by the fact that all of these red states basically re [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=898.8s)]
*  confirmed and enshrined a woman's right to choose may actually go more to show that the Supreme Court [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=906.16s)]
*  is totally out of touch, and that they didn't need to touch Roe v Wade. And the fact that they did [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=912.3199999999999s)]
*  opened up, you know, a huge can of worms in 50 states that now go and need to go and adjudicate [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=917.6s)]
*  this thing, where it looked like actually that decision, even back in the day, even though the [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=922.88s)]
*  way that it was done, you know, there was a lot of room for improvement, clearly, everybody agrees [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=928.4s)]
*  with that, but was actually after you know, 50 plus years reasonable law. And so now that you took [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=932.32s)]
*  that law away, now folks even in the red states are like, No, it was fine. Which means that this [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=938.0s)]
*  whole thing was a huge political gambit more than it was actual societal intention. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=942.32s)]
*  Okay, so we are going to move on now I just I'll add my final two cents to that. As I said, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=949.6s)]
*  I do think women and the LGBT community have very long memories and the people who are in the [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=954.4000000000001s)]
*  moderate are not going to forget how they were treated by the GOP in this specific issue. So [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=959.9200000000001s)]
*  biggest political surprise, we didn't do predictions last year. But I'll just run down what everybody [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=965.7600000000001s)]
*  said was their political surprise. I said, the fact that Kamala Harris was sidelined was pretty [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=970.72s)]
*  surprising to me. And that's continued. Shamath, you said Joe Manchin was your biggest political [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=975.84s)]
*  surprise. Glenn Youngkin winning, Sax that was your biggest surprise. And Friedberg, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=981.76s)]
*  the January 6 crowd, making it into the Capitol during the insurrection was your biggest [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=988.1600000000001s)]
*  political surprise. So here we go. Our 2022 biggest political surprise. Sax, let's start with [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=995.6s)]
*  you. You have a lot to say about politics. Go. Well, the biggest political surprise to me was [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1001.92s)]
*  no red wave. So I admit, I got this prediction wrong. You know, I got all my previous ones right, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1006.64s)]
*  Jay Kalis. I'm gonna admit I got this one wrong. You know, I believe that the electorate would [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1011.92s)]
*  focus on the fundamentals. Three quarters of the country thought we're on the wrong track. Three [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1016.64s)]
*  quarters think we're in a recession. Nevertheless, the Republicans did not do nearly as well as [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1020.16s)]
*  predicted. They only gained nine seats in the House. They actually lost a seat in the Senate. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1025.28s)]
*  And I think that that had something to do with candidate quality. And of course, the whole [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1029.52s)]
*  election denial narrative basically was a disaster for them. I hope that the Republicans move on and [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1034.56s)]
*  stop talking about the past. What voters want to hear about is the future. Friedberg, did you have [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1042.08s)]
*  a biggest political surprise for 2022? Friedberg? Yeah, it's also the failure of the red wave. I [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1047.04s)]
*  mean, that was my my pick. I think the consensus going into the election was with, you know, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1051.52s)]
*  rising inflation and the disdain that everyone had for the way politicians kind of managed us [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1058.32s)]
*  through COVID and then managed us through the economic recovery. It was inevitable to see a [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1063.76s)]
*  flip and it didn't happen. I think obviously we talked about why that is, but that was a big [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1068.3999999999999s)]
*  surprise for everyone. Chamath, what was your biggest political surprise of 2022? Chamath [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1072.72s)]
*  Palihapitiya. The absolute toothlessness of MAGA and Donald Trump. I mean, he was just a scarlet [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1078.32s)]
*  letter. If you were anywhere near this guy, you were going to lose. And that's surprising considering [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1086.96s)]
*  how traditional Republicans were pandering to him up until frankly, just a few months ago. So I [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1095.28s)]
*  think that we exposed the emperor as having no clothes and that he marginalizes and sidelines [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1102.48s)]
*  candidates into a fringe following that cannot go mainstream. That was really surprising to see [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1111.6s)]
*  how stark that was this year. Fantastic. I'm going to build on your Chamath. I had two here. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1118.64s)]
*  Number two was Roe v. Wade, but we've beaten that. I think we discussed it as much as we possibly [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1125.92s)]
*  could. My number one building on your Chamath is that despite what's happened with Trump, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1130.64s)]
*  the documents, his cases in the United States and New York about taxes, despite all of this, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1136.3200000000002s)]
*  the January 6th insurrection, despite all this, Trump is still viable. I can't believe he's still [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1144.0s)]
*  viable and that he is going to be out there in the primaries and he's going to have to debate [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1150.24s)]
*  DeSantis. And I don't know that DeSantis can beat him in a debate. I think he might [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1155.76s)]
*  win. So this is completely scary for both me and Sachs. I think it's terrifying. Sachs is [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1160.8s)]
*  nightmare and mine. Well, I think he's mainly viable in the minds of the MAGA dead-enders and [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1164.88s)]
*  the mainstream media who want to keep him alive. And the Biden administration wants to keep him [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1172.24s)]
*  alive and they'll do anything to keep him alive and in the news. And you love keeping him in the [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1177.1200000000001s)]
*  news. So it's a codependent relationship between the mainstream media, which you sometimes front [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1180.56s)]
*  for and Trump. Oh, be careful telling me what I think. We need to end this codependency, J. Cal. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1187.04s)]
*  Well, I wish the Republican party would finally take ownership of this disaster that is Trump [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1193.6799999999998s)]
*  and tell him that he has no business, but you guys keep him in the game. And the fact that he's [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1199.2s)]
*  viable, again, your personal nightmare and mine. Okay. Biggest business winner. Everybody excited [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1202.8s)]
*  to get off politics right now and get to our kill zone, which is business. So last year, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1208.64s)]
*  we had predictions in this category. I had said Disney, that's an up and down prediction. I'll [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1215.1200000000001s)]
*  get into that in a moment. Tramath, you said small and medium sized businesses, the old SMBs. Sachs [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1219.92s)]
*  said rise of the rest, the flyover States. And Freberg, you said Stripe. Tramath, let's start [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1225.1200000000001s)]
*  with you. SMBs. What did you get right? What did you get wrong here? I mean, I whiffed, it just [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1230.72s)]
*  completely missed the global macro shift that we embarked on in full force, starting in Q1 of this [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1234.96s)]
*  year. It is the most important business story of the year. It's just like we have an absolute [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1243.76s)]
*  complete regime change. And by the way, that regime change is so complete and so thorough [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1250.0s)]
*  that it even touched Japan just a few weeks ago, or sorry, just a few days ago, where Japan who [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1259.04s)]
*  finally yielded on this idea of you're going to work and have negative interest rates and yield [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1264.72s)]
*  curve control, even they finally broke and raised rates. So it is an absolute worldwide sea change [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1269.1200000000001s)]
*  in how we need to think about risk. And I think that's worth talking about a little bit later in [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1276.8000000000002s)]
*  the show. But that was the single biggest business story of the year. I'll add to what Tramath said, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1282.0s)]
*  I missed this too, even though on another prediction, when you asked what the biggest [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1287.2s)]
*  business loser would be, I think I said that it would be asset classes that had been pumped up [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1290.72s)]
*  by the feds money printing because you start to feel... So I got that part right. But what I didn't [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1296.16s)]
*  connect it to were all the asset classes actually got pummeled. So I kind of conceptually understood [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1301.84s)]
*  that rates were rising, but I totally underestimated the magnitude of the shift, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1308.32s)]
*  the way that growth stocks would get hammered, the way that crypto would get destroyed, the fact that [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1313.68s)]
*  tiger basically got blown out of the industry. I mean, I had the right general intuition, but I [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1319.68s)]
*  didn't translate it into the specific asset types and the magnitude of the shift. And also the, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1325.6000000000001s)]
*  like what Tramath said, a real regime change now and how markets are viewing stock performance. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1331.3600000000001s)]
*  RG It's really incredible. Freiburg, let's get in on this. This is somewhere where you [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1336.3200000000002s)]
*  can contribute deeply. What do you think about your take last year? And you still believe in Stripe? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1341.52s)]
*  Tramath Yeah, I mean, look, it's a business that obviously benefited greatly from the pandemic and [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1346.72s)]
*  the adoption of the payment processing infrastructure that they've built across various [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1354.48s)]
*  kind of e-commerce platforms. I'm not an investor, so I don't have any numbers, but there are public [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1360.96s)]
*  reports that have highlighted that their revenue increased 66% this year. They've indicated that [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1366.64s)]
*  they're probably going to experience significant revenue slowdown with the recession ahead. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1371.44s)]
*  But it still seems like a super high quality business. And, you know, valuation wise, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1375.28s)]
*  who knows what things are going to be worth when they ultimately come to market. There's certainly [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1380.48s)]
*  no one going to going public right now. So at some point, we'll see, you know, whether valuations [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1384.56s)]
*  play out. But it seems like it continues to be a very strong, one of the strongest private businesses [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1389.68s)]
*  that's being built in Silicon Valley. RG We will get to 2022, biggest business winners in one second. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1394.56s)]
*  I will just say for Disney, what a swing. Bob Chapick in and then out and now Bob Iger back. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1401.04s)]
*  So I feel like I got this one wrong and right. At the same time, I still believe in the company [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1406.3999999999999s)]
*  deeply. I think they're gonna have a big win. Let's get to our actual biggest winner of 2022. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1410.48s)]
*  Sax, why don't you lead us off with your biggest winner of 2022 for business? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1417.9199999999998s)]
*  Biggest winner of 2022 for business. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1422.96s)]
*  I said Lockheed Martin along with other defense stocks. Lockheed Martin, which makes Javelins [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1426.16s)]
*  and high Mars is up 40% in the past year when most of the markets been weighed down. Northrop Grumman [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1431.76s)]
*  is also up almost 40%. And even some of the lesser performers like Raytheon and General Dynamics are [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1436.88s)]
*  up about almost 20% in a terrible market environment. The fact of the matter is war is terrible, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1442.48s)]
*  but it appears to be good business. We've sent so many weapons to Ukraine that there's recent [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1449.12s)]
*  press reports that the US stockpiles of missiles, Javelins and Stingers are now depleted. So these [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1454.0s)]
*  companies are gonna keep doing well for the next year at least. Now there's a new appropriation [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1461.4399999999998s)]
*  sailing through something like 44 billion of new funding for the war. It's now over $100 billion. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1465.76s)]
*  McConnell says this is the Republicans' number one priority. This is now a bipartisan concern. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1471.6s)]
*  And if you think the war is expensive, just wait for reconstruction, that's estimated to cost [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1477.52s)]
*  roughly a trillion dollars to build Ukraine back. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1481.76s)]
*  Sachs, can I ask you a question about that? When we fund these wars, I've heard different [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1485.2s)]
*  versions of this, can't get a clear answer. When we provide weapons and systems like this, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1490.8799999999999s)]
*  are they not on account and we ask for money back at some point? Do you know the answer to that [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1496.24s)]
*  question? You think we're gonna get money back? Are you kidding me? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1500.48s)]
*  It seems to be sometimes that we do. So that's why I was asking. I think it's something [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1503.28s)]
*  there hasn't been clarity on. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1507.04s)]
*  Look, I think the war has been phenomenal business for the military industrial complex. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1508.0s)]
*  So that's what we're seeing here. Not so great for the rest of the economy. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1513.12s)]
*  Freeberg, what do you got? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1517.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think you guys will remember last November, I predicted energy and defense to be the [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1517.92s)]
*  best performing stocks for this year. Sachs is right, I think defense is up 40%. So I kind of [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1522.8s)]
*  went with the bigger oil and gas companies are up, you know, across the board about 47% in terms of [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1529.2s)]
*  equity value in the public markets a year to date, compared to the S&P being down about 20%. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1536.4s)]
*  So over the short term, I would argue oil and gas companies. But I think that over the long term, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1542.88s)]
*  there were a couple of big breakthrough moments that I would give kind of, you know, the winner [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1547.68s)]
*  in business that will benefit over the long term to open AI and to fusion startups. And we'll talk [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1553.44s)]
*  more about why for those two, obviously later when we get to the biggest winner in tech and science. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1558.96s)]
*  But yeah, short term oil and gas, they benefited from the supply constraints and the conflict in [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1565.04s)]
*  the Ukraine. And then longer term, I think, open AI and fusion startups. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1568.72s)]
*  Well, and by the way, I mean, just to give Freeberg some credit here, you actually predicted the war [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1571.76s)]
*  or you predicted a war. I don't know if you predicted this war, but you predicted war in 2022. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1576.32s)]
*  Yeah, I predicted the war and Putin kind of rising to the center stage and the defense. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1580.96s)]
*  Wank the dog. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1586.72s)]
*  That was a huge prediction because I don't think most people, even most analysts, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1587.36s)]
*  well, they were surprised even when the invasion happened. I think people were [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1590.64s)]
*  still very surprised both that Putin would order it. But also, if you say the situation, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1593.5200000000002s)]
*  I think you got to be surprised that we didn't negotiate harder to try and prevent it. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1597.92s)]
*  I traded it too. I bought an energy ETF. So it worked out for me. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1602.0800000000002s)]
*  Okay, Chamath, your biggest business winner of 2022. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1605.8400000000001s)]
*  Nick can throw it up, but it's basically any single person that understands the following formula. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1610.4s)]
*  This is the capital asset pricing model. So what is this? This is like before you make any investment, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1615.92s)]
*  what it actually tells you is here's the rate of return that you need to generate above the [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1624.3999999999999s)]
*  risk-free rate in order for you to justify making that investment. And if you really understood the [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1629.52s)]
*  capital asset pricing model going into 2022, it would have been difficult for you to not make money [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1637.04s)]
*  because all of a sudden, as the 10-year flexed up and as the volatility, particularly of things [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1643.68s)]
*  like tech stocks, went crazy, you could have figured out where to park your money. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1649.68s)]
*  And all these people that have built businesses around this capital asset pricing model, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1656.64s)]
*  so you have companies, obviously. So you have sectors of the economy like defense or [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1661.04s)]
*  energy stocks, consumer goods and staples. They all had moments where they all did well. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1666.24s)]
*  But if you take it one step above, the organizations that actually ran big macro books or [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1672.0s)]
*  really understood how to algorithmically implement this capital asset pricing model just [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1677.52s)]
*  ran roughshod over the markets. And said in a different way, it's sort of my background, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1683.36s)]
*  which is if you understood the capital asset pricing model, you would have been able to [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1689.68s)]
*  do it. If you had understood the capital asset pricing model, you would have been a massive bear, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1694.4s)]
*  and the bear got fed this year to a degree that none of us could have anticipated. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1699.0400000000002s)]
*  Okay. So am I correct saying the capital asset pricing model is the biggest winner? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1702.8000000000002s)]
*  Or no, people that understood it. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1707.92s)]
*  People that understood it. Got it. Okay. And for my biggest winner, I went with [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1709.6000000000001s)]
*  chat, GPT slash OpenAI and their partner, Microsoft. Why did I pick that as the biggest winner? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1713.76s)]
*  On my other podcast this week in startups, we played a game chat GPT versus the first result [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1719.68s)]
*  of Google's and Molly and I could not tell the difference. And in fact, we picked chat GPT's [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1725.76s)]
*  answers often above Google's Google, one of the greatest businesses and franchises ever created [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1732.16s)]
*  has no answer at currently for chat GPT. Because Google's business model is to get you to click on [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1740.48s)]
*  an ad between links. If you give the actual answer, then the person doesn't stops clicking. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1748.72s)]
*  If they stop clicking, Google stops making money. There is no business model in search. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1755.28s)]
*  If the person gets their answer because they're done. This is an existential threat like we have [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1761.68s)]
*  not seen. And our friend Sam Altman has a line chat GPT slash OpenAI with Microsoft. Microsoft, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1766.72s)]
*  I think is going to release a and there's a prediction as well. A search engine with [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1773.52s)]
*  OpenAI that has a significant impact on Google's franchise. We didn't think this would ever happen [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1781.2s)]
*  and it's here. Okay, the biggest losers in business. We made predictions last year. I said in 2020, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1787.52s)]
*  I predicted in 2021, the biggest loser in 2022 would be crypto. By the way, Friedberg, you agreed [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1795.04s)]
*  with me and we nailed it. You agreed with me. Well, yes, that's correct. We were in agreement. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1800.8s)]
*  How about that? We were in agreement. We were in agreement. Sax, you said and Chamath visa slash [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1807.6s)]
*  mastercard. We'll get into that. And Sax, you said asset classes benefiting from government pumps. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1813.84s)]
*  Very interesting. The Fed stopping QE. Interesting. Anybody have comments on their predictions or [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1819.36s)]
*  each other's predictions from last year? On a percentage basis, David absolutely nailed it. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1824.88s)]
*  Sax absolutely nailed it. On a dollar basis, the biggest business loser of this year was Big Tech. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1831.1200000000001s)]
*  And I think that you saw three things happen, which I think are important for the future. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1837.7600000000002s)]
*  The first was it was the most crowded trade, both by professional money managers, as well as retail. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1842.96s)]
*  And that fever finally broke in the last half of in the second half of this year. And now going into [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1852.4s)]
*  into these last few weeks, you're seeing a lot of panicked [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1859.36s)]
*  selling to cover losses and other things. So I think that number one, that happened. Number two, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1864.48s)]
*  regulators basically said we're going to go after these guys every single which way we can. And then [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1871.84s)]
*  number three, I think it started to change the innovation cycle where people now actually believe [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1877.84s)]
*  that they can't outspend because folks won't tolerate it and the things that they're spending [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1882.8799999999999s)]
*  their money on seem kind of foolish. And so I think the you know, Big Tech is probably not [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1888.0s)]
*  discussed enough. But it was a huge loser for this year. In terms of what happened. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1893.36s)]
*  2022 choose actual biggest business loser Chamath says Big Tech. Freiburg, who is your biggest [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1898.8799999999999s)]
*  business loser for 2022? I mean, this one's just a simple FTX. I mean, that was such a incredible [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1905.68s)]
*  revelation of the scale of the scam and the fraud and the craziness that went on. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1914.16s)]
*  And I think what was interesting about FTX is it had implications, not just for crypto, and not just [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1919.28s)]
*  for kind of offshore regulatory, not just for fraud, but also for the investors, we had a whole [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1925.2s)]
*  debate about whether the press and journalists failed to kind of, you know, appropriately [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1930.32s)]
*  investigate this guy rather than give him accolades because he said the right things, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1936.32s)]
*  which he said he did over IM. And investors failed to do relevant amounts of due diligence [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1939.6799999999998s)]
*  or former board and have proper governance over him, because they wanted to be part of the hot [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1944.72s)]
*  new thing. And everyone had capital to deploy. And I think what was interesting about the FTX [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1948.48s)]
*  failure is it didn't just it wasn't just a failure due to fraud, but it revealed so many parts of [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1952.24s)]
*  kind of, you know, I call it, you know, systemic laziness and systemic kind of blind eye and [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1957.84s)]
*  systemic bias that allowed and enabled this to happen. It was really a revealing kind of failure. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1965.9199999999998s)]
*  And that's why I kind of gave it the award. Mr. David Sacks, who is your biggest business [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1972.8s)]
*  loser of 2022? Well, you kind of mentioned this, I picked Bob Chaypeck, he's the former [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1977.84s)]
*  Disney CEO. He was Eiger's handpicked successor three years ago. Then the pandemic hit, which [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1984.24s)]
*  shut down the theme parks. Then I think the big mistake was allowing himself to be maw-mow by [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1989.76s)]
*  woke employees into picking a fight with DeSantis over the so-called don't say gay bill. That caused [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=1994.24s)]
*  DeSantis to retaliate by threatening the special privileges that Disney enjoys in the state. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2000.16s)]
*  And then he had Eiger undermining him behind the scenes. This was revealed, I think it was in a [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2005.84s)]
*  Wall Street Journal story that he was grousing to insiders that Chaypeck was not soliciting his [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2010.32s)]
*  advice and he was undermining confidence in him with the board. And recently, Chaypeck was [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2015.6s)]
*  forced out and Eiger was put back in charge. Fantastic choice for the biggest loser. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2021.2s)]
*  How brutal does Eiger look in that Wall Street Journal piece? I mean, would anybody work for him? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2024.48s)]
*  Yes, he is incredible. He looks terrible. I agree. I read that piece twice, actually. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2031.04s)]
*  The CFO calling him up, she was the one who stabbed him, you know, and knifed Chaypeck. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2035.44s)]
*  It's a great Wall Street Journal long read. I don't think that that happens without the [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2041.68s)]
*  support of the person waiting in the wings. Hey, listen, there's a couple of jobs you never [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2046.0s)]
*  quit. You never quit a hit TV show. You never quit a hit band like Roger Waterdiss or Pink Floyd. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2050.6400000000003s)]
*  Why didn't they just extend this retirement? You never quit the Disney job. It's the best job, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2056.08s)]
*  it's the best CEO job in the world. But Jason, why go through the theatrics of like grooming [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2059.36s)]
*  somebody putting them in your job and then undermining them? Like I all I'm saying is, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2064.08s)]
*  if you're a good he made a mistake. I think he made a mistake. He quit and he wanted it. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2068.72s)]
*  And also if like if you're a good up and coming exec. I mean, what do you do if like all of a [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2072.64s)]
*  sudden like, you know, you have the opportunity to get groomed for that job. It just seems really [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2078.24s)]
*  risky. Yeah, I mean, I think Bob Eiger realized when he in that piece, they say he went on his [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2082.96s)]
*  yacht, his wife didn't come with him. The Wall Street Journal piece is incredible. And he's got [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2089.44s)]
*  bored. And he's 70 something years old. He's like early 70s. Why would you give up the greatest job [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2093.52s)]
*  in the world? So he went back and he took it back. Didn't Disney have a mandatory retirement age? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2098.32s)]
*  But this is my point is he was so he was so prolific. He could have extended it. Why not [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2102.64s)]
*  just extend it and be done with it? Yeah. Did you guys read the book he wrote? That [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2106.48s)]
*  ride of a lifetime? What is it? Yeah. And I think that what was interesting about that book [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2112.72s)]
*  was the entire thing was built around a series of deals that he did. It was like I did this [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2116.96s)]
*  acquisition, then I did this acquisition, then I did this acquisition. And everything for him was [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2122.0s)]
*  building this this this empire by doing deals. And someone whose storyline and narrative that they [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2126.32s)]
*  tell of themselves, that's built as a series of deals is a deal junkie. And you're not going to [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2132.32s)]
*  be a deal junkie where that's your excitement. That's the thrill. That's the adventure that you [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2138.16s)]
*  get out of life. And then you go and sit on a yacht, you're not doing any deal sitting on a yacht. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2142.08s)]
*  And you're going to want to get back to that. And I think it's less about kind of management and [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2146.16s)]
*  product. And it was much more about being in the midst of doing deals. And that's probably why he [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2149.84s)]
*  came back. If this was part of Eiger's diabolical strategy, get back, let me just say like, one of [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2154.4s)]
*  the ways he did it, I mean, Chaypek had the right instincts, which is when this whole Florida debate [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2158.88s)]
*  happened over don't say gay, highly contentious, no comment, no comment, his instinct was to stay [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2163.44s)]
*  out of it. But then Iger made some statements about how companies have to live with their values and [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2168.8s)]
*  that kind of stuff. And then the employees started, you know, again, you know, Mao Mao, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2173.76s)]
*  him to get involved. And he took the bait and he got involved. And what he didn't expect is that [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2178.8s)]
*  DeSantis wasn't going to just roll over. DeSantis hit him back really hard and it cost them economically. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2183.92s)]
*  And then that whole thing is a revolt. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2189.44s)]
*  Jared Suellentrop And in the first interview that Iger gave when asked about this question, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2191.6800000000003s)]
*  he was like, no comment. So he went right back to it. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2195.2000000000003s)]
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, he's like, we're not going to get involved in politics anymore. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2198.48s)]
*  Jared Suellentrop We're not getting involved in politics anymore. It was hilarious. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2200.5600000000004s)]
*  That was hilarious. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2203.6s)]
*  Pete Slauson He nudged Chapek to basically get involved in politics and then Chapek [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2204.7200000000003s)]
*  basically became cannon fodder for DeSantis. And then Iger's like, oh, we're out of this now. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2208.16s)]
*  I mean, how diabolical was that? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2215.04s)]
*  Jared Suellentrop So diabolical, so dirty. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2216.96s)]
*  Jared Suellentrop The other two things were Chapek said, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2219.04s)]
*  we're going to take away your PNLs to each of the leaders. That is like just neutering them. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2223.44s)]
*  He basically said everybody's under the CFO, everybody's going to be on one PNL. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2228.56s)]
*  That infuriated all the creatives. And then he went to war with Scarlett Johansson over [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2232.24s)]
*  a $10 million settlement for her Black Widow. He couldn't handle talent, he couldn't handle [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2237.6s)]
*  the politics, and he wanted to control everybody's PNL just unforced error after unforced error. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2242.56s)]
*  Congratulations to my guy, Baye Bajger. I own the stock. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2248.24s)]
*  Pete Slauson Do you think he was diabolical at all? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2250.3999999999996s)]
*  Jared Suellentrop Oh, in the best possible way. In the best possible way, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2251.9199999999996s)]
*  which means that Disney stock is going to go up. Yes, I'm buying more Disney stock this year. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2254.64s)]
*  Is all the woke progressive politics that he projects, is that all just a game to mask what [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2258.7999999999997s)]
*  a viper's nest their executive suite really is? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2264.16s)]
*  Pete Slauson Are you telling me that Disney is a political [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2266.7999999999997s)]
*  corporation after Eisner and Bob Iger and all of this? Michael Ovitz? I mean, it's the history of [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2269.2799999999997s)]
*  Disney. It's the greatest job in the world. It is Game of Thrones to get that job. And Bob Iger got [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2274.96s)]
*  it back. He's my guy. I'm sticking with him. And they have the best IP in the business. I don't [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2280.64s)]
*  care how he gets that job back. He's awesome. Jared Suellentrop [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2284.8s)]
*  I gotta say the IP at WarnerMedia is a real strong contender. I mean, that White Lotus, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2287.52s)]
*  we were talking about this yesterday, how good White Lotus season two was. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2292.0s)]
*  Pete Slauson Let's open up the White Lotus discussion. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2294.88s)]
*  Jared Suellentrop It is incredible how HBO produces extraordinary hit after extraordinary hit. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2296.48s)]
*  The quality and the consistency of that quality coming out of HBO is like nothing else. I mean, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2301.84s)]
*  look, Avatar 2, I did not like Avatar 1. I thought it was junk. Avatar 2 is getting panned for being [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2307.92s)]
*  junk as well. Not everything that comes out of Disney is a hit. They certainly have the best [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2312.88s)]
*  franchises. But man, WarnerMedia has a lot to contend with. And, you know, they could end up [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2316.96s)]
*  being a real challenger to Disney in the years ahead. Pete Slauson [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2322.6400000000003s)]
*  Sax, did you watch the White Lotus season two? Yes or no? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2325.28s)]
*  Sax Well, we, no problem. It is absolutely fantastic. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2327.92s)]
*  We have to do a little fan service here. What did you love, Chamath, about White Lotus season two? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2331.44s)]
*  Give the fans a little service here. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2336.1600000000003s)]
*  Sax Wait, it's on season two. I didn't even see season one. I don't even know what you guys are [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2337.44s)]
*  talking about. Okay, it's the hottest show in television. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2341.2s)]
*  Where have I been? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2344.24s)]
*  Chase Well, I'll tell you what's incredible is there's a diversity of characters and they [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2344.64s)]
*  weave the super like, you know, interesting story together. But each of the characters are so [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2348.3999999999996s)]
*  distinct. And the characters are played so well. I mean, we were talking about, you know, we were [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2352.72s)]
*  kind of at dinner last night talking about who our favorite character was on the show. And everyone [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2359.4399999999996s)]
*  has a different answer. And everyone has a different reason. And then there are characters [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2363.4399999999996s)]
*  that you hate. But the fact that you hate them and the fact that you despise them draws you in, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2367.52s)]
*  you're drawn into these characters. I think that the way that they kind of portrayed and the way [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2372.08s)]
*  that the characters were acted by the by the actors, and then the way that they all kind of [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2377.04s)]
*  weave together to tell this extraordinary story. It was really, it was really compelling. And it [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2381.68s)]
*  was like, just super impressive, directing, acting, writing everything. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2386.8s)]
*  There are a handful of scenes in season one, and season two, which I would say are unbelievably, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2390.8s)]
*  psychologically violent. And there's just no other way to describe like, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2398.6400000000003s)]
*  how they just expo and by the way, they do it with simple shots, very simple dialogue, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2406.32s)]
*  it's almost nonchalant in the way that they present these truth bombs. And you have to [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2413.52s)]
*  sit there and process it. And you're just like, Oh, my God, it's just it's wave after wave. It's [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2418.96s)]
*  an incredible, incredibly well written show. The character development is extraordinary. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2424.48s)]
*  Amazing. Amazing production and set design, by the way, also, I mean, when you when you watch it, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2429.2s)]
*  don't you want to you want to go to those locations? Do you guys remember in season one? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2433.92s)]
*  Sachs will remember this because Sachs watched it season one, the family is sitting at the table [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2439.44s)]
*  where they're watching the Hawaiian dance. And Paula, the guest of the family gets up and leaves, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2443.6s)]
*  she can't take it anymore. And then the next day, they're in a discussion about it. And the father [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2448.88s)]
*  says something about, I think, hierarchy or imperialism or something. And it goes around [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2454.72s)]
*  the table and she just deadpan she says, Well, maybe it's just time for others to eat. Talking [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2459.7599999999998s)]
*  about, you know, like fixing these wrongs. And I had to listen to it two or three times. I'm like, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2464.64s)]
*  Oh, my God, that is that is a line that just sticks in your brain. There's a few of those in [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2470.96s)]
*  that show that I think are excited. And I was saying, like, they really draw you in [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2475.84s)]
*  the set design, the production design is so compelling. You want to be there, you want to [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2481.04s)]
*  be in that experience with those characters. I know. So yeah, you're totally drawn to the [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2485.84s)]
*  pineapple suite. I mean, and then in this season, that whole hotel, I looked up the hotel, by the [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2491.6s)]
*  way, online, they hadn't, you know, they're their own set design, people come in and redo the hotel, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2495.52s)]
*  but it is an actual hotel. It's a real, they just made it so magical. Yeah, it was such an incredible [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2498.96s)]
*  Oh, free book, we should make that the host of the All In Summit 2023. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2504.0s)]
*  Sorry, I'm working on my Jennifer Coolidge. Tell your director, David Sacks, what you'd like to [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2512.08s)]
*  do for you. Yeah, my biggest loser was crypto. And I think there'll be a subsequent domino to fall, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2516.88s)]
*  which is now that Gary G. and the SEC has FtX and the FTT tokens as the grift, he's going to go down [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2522.8s)]
*  the list of other tokens. And he is going to start doing more prosecutions of griffs in crypto. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2531.92s)]
*  Biggest loser for me. All right, biggest business surprise. Let's see if we can get Sacks back [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2540.0s)]
*  engaged in the conversation now that we're not talking about art and life. Sacks, last year, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2545.2000000000003s)]
*  your biggest business surprise. Sacks just produced a movie about Dolly. I know he is, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2552.0s)]
*  I'm joking with him. He's a true artist. And he sold it to Mark Cuban. Congratulations on the sale. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2557.44s)]
*  David, I guess me and Cuban are besties now. Fantastic. In 2021, our selections for business [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2562.72s)]
*  biggest business surprises. I was very surprised by DOWS, Chamath by Moderna, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2568.0s)]
*  Sacks by Tech Moving to Miami and Friedberg. You were surprised by NFTs. What were we surprised by [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2574.48s)]
*  in 2022? Friedberg, we'll start with you. Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, I think, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2580.4s)]
*  took everyone by surprise. It kind of went, I mean, this is such an obvious one, but it went from [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2584.8s)]
*  a whimsical fantasy and idea to suddenly, you know, cold-hearted reality with, you know, a huge kind [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2588.96s)]
*  of negotiating saga that took place and court battles and all the drama that ensued. And here's [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2596.48s)]
*  what I think was most surprising about it. It wasn't just the acquisition and the fact that the [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2602.8s)]
*  acquisition closed, but it was the incredible veracity of the head-cutting, cost-cutting, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2607.36s)]
*  the demands that people returned to work, returned to the office. And then what was most surprising [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2615.52s)]
*  that followed that is the impact that that seems to have had on the rest of Silicon Valley, where [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2619.84s)]
*  now nearly every VC I speak with, every CEO, every board is looking to Elon's behavior for right or [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2625.04s)]
*  for wrong, for, you know, moral or not, and saying that's a model for how you can challenge your team [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2631.28s)]
*  to achieve the impossible in an impossibly difficult environment, which is what we find [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2637.2s)]
*  ourselves in. And so I think it was a series of surprising events. He bought Twitter, he made [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2641.2s)]
*  these incredible changes, and then everyone seems to be looking to that as a model. And it's really [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2645.7599999999998s)]
*  resonated, it's created a rippling effect. I'm not saying it's good, I'm not saying it's bad, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2650.16s)]
*  I'm not saying it's moral right or wrong. But the whole thing was really an incredible, surprising, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2653.12s)]
*  unexpected saga this year. So I give the Elon acquisition of Twitter kind of the award. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2658.24s)]
*  Chamath, do you have a biggest surprise? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2663.36s)]
*  I would say it's Jerome Powell and the Fed and their staunch hawkishness on inflation. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2666.56s)]
*  I think everybody wants all of this to be over. And I think we're definitely in the last few innings [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2674.88s)]
*  of it. But I think what was surprising was how consistent and how hawkish and how bearish [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2679.52s)]
*  Jerome Powell was every chance he got. He didn't capitulate or waiver from the key message, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2687.52s)]
*  which he was saying from the beginning, which is, we have the tools to fix a broken economy, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2694.88s)]
*  but we don't have the tools to fix runaway inflation. And so we will raise rates higher [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2701.04s)]
*  than anyone expects and keep them there longer than anybody wants, because on the back end of [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2707.84s)]
*  it, we can fix a few broken bones. But if left unchecked, this could really do a lot of damage. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2712.24s)]
*  And I think that that was an enormous surprise that all the political pressure in the world, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2717.52s)]
*  all of the financial capital markets pressure in the world, did nothing to change his position. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2723.04s)]
*  Sachs, what was your biggest business surprise of 2022? David Sachs, his biggest surprise? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2727.9199999999996s)]
*  It was a pretty big surprise that Adobe bought Figma for 20 billion. That price tag in this [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2734.0s)]
*  environment, pretty big surprise. But I got to say, I think Freeberg nailed it. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2739.12s)]
*  Got to say that the business saga of the year was Elon buying Twitter first, the liberal media was [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2743.2799999999997s)]
*  up in arms that he might do it. Then they insisted that he must complete the deal. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2750.16s)]
*  In any event, he did ultimately buy the company. Now he's affecting his changes. I agree. That's [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2755.04s)]
*  the big business story of this year. Certainly it was a big surprise for me that I got deposition [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2760.0s)]
*  for six hours. Is it a surprise that you're sitting in Twitter's headquarters today, right now? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2764.08s)]
*  It is a surprise. But just by the way, the rumors and speculation are getting out of hand. I am not [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2768.8799999999997s)]
*  a candidate for CEO of Twitter. So I want to put the kibosh on that because it's starting to get [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2773.2s)]
*  out of hand. J. Cal, the job is yours, my friend. Congratulations. All right. I guess let me know [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2778.48s)]
*  when I start. You've earned it. You've worked hard. You've demonstrated your confidence. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2783.92s)]
*  J. Cal, the last man standing. Outwit, outlast. Now that Sachs has said he is not taking the job, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2789.12s)]
*  a bunch of libs have just stopped taking Xanax. The libs biggest fear was Sachs was going to get [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2795.36s)]
*  that job. We just canceled a bunch of Xanax prescriptions. Congratulations to the libs. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2801.28s)]
*  Sachs is not going to be your overlord on Twitter. For me, it's obvious the Twitter acquisition is [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2806.96s)]
*  the biggest surprise by far and away. Freeberg, I couldn't have summarized it better. I will say, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2812.56s)]
*  in six weeks, what we have seen there is nothing short of extraordinary. Have there been bumps in [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2819.2000000000003s)]
*  the road? Has it been a little chaotic at times perhaps? But the features that are coming fast [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2823.2s)]
*  and furious are going to be the story going forward. You've seen Twitter for Business. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2831.3599999999997s)]
*  Sachs had his fingerprints, all that. You may fingerprints all over that. You may have seen [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2836.8799999999997s)]
*  hashtags for stock tickers. I was briefly involved in that. There are going to be so many features [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2841.7599999999998s)]
*  coming. And this is what Elon's zone of excellence is. Product. He is an engineer. He's a product [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2847.04s)]
*  genius. The proof is in the pudding, whether it's rocket ships or the cars, we're going to see a [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2855.2s)]
*  parade of features. I predict in another six to 18 weeks, we will see people talking about all the [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2859.92s)]
*  great features in Twitter, not any of the transitional issues and people will be shocked. My runner up, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2866.64s)]
*  Meta stock collapsing. That was my runner up for the biggest business shock is that they just [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2873.04s)]
*  absolutely collapsed. I was just going to add to what you're saying about new features launching. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2879.84s)]
*  While we've been sitting here on this pod, I've been checking my Twitter feed, there's a new [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2884.16s)]
*  feature where there's a view count on all of your tweets and all of everybody else's tweets as well. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2887.84s)]
*  So you can see how many views a tweet is generating. So this tweet that I posted yesterday [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2893.2799999999997s)]
*  has 1.5 million views. It's incredible. So it really shows the incredible reach of Twitter. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2898.64s)]
*  And anybody who's thinking about going to some knockoff like Macedon or something [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2905.7599999999998s)]
*  is going to have to contend with the fact that it doesn't have nearly the distribution. So I think [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2909.84s)]
*  this really shows the power of Twitter. And then Dave Rubin noticed my, I tweeted this just a second [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2915.92s)]
*  ago and Dave Rubin noted that the New York Times doesn't have anywhere near the views for its tweets [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2922.88s)]
*  because they bought all their followers, which is interesting. I didn't know that, but I just went [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2930.1600000000003s)]
*  over to the New York Times profile and my tweets are routinely getting 10 to 20 times more reach, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2934.4s)]
*  more views than theirs. So this is a super interesting indicator of who actually people [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2940.2400000000002s)]
*  are paying attention to on Twitter. It's fascinating. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2946.7200000000003s)]
*  This is fascinating. I'm looking at my own. I just did, how do you give a $30 billion fraud [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2950.64s)]
*  bail referring to SPF? And that was just less than an hour ago. No, it's 30 minutes. Yeah, an hour ago. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2954.7999999999997s)]
*  And I have 50,000 views already, which is 10% of my follower count. So this is an extraordinary. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2961.12s)]
*  You see right next to likes, retweets, quote tweets, the feature train is coming. And this [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2966.7999999999997s)]
*  will change the dialogue. All these haters who are like Twitter is going to go down, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2972.3199999999997s)]
*  who are rooting against Elon. Let me tell you something. If a guy can land two rockets at a time [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2976.48s)]
*  and he can literally restart the electric car movement and he becomes the number one car in [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2981.36s)]
*  any category, he releases a car in how on earth would you bet against him to build software? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2987.2s)]
*  You have to be idiotic. This is way too much. I mean, you guys like we should. Sorry. He's a [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2993.92s)]
*  feature. I get it. I get it. Second ad. Yeah, you're selling a product for a company that you guys [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=2998.72s)]
*  are working at. Like, I mean, come on. I'm not working at the company. Well, you guys are advisors, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3003.68s)]
*  right? Nick, can you let me show one other feature? So I think it's cool. Nick, let's go. Yeah. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3008.56s)]
*  Keep on features. Let's go pull up my profile real quick. Welcome to this week in Twitter. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3012.72s)]
*  Twitter now has affiliate badges. You can see I've got a little craft ventures badge next to my name. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3018.0s)]
*  So if you, you should be able to click on it actually to get to the craft ventures profile. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3023.04s)]
*  Yeah. So you're going to be able to affiliate users with business accounts and it creates [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3029.44s)]
*  kind of secondary badges after the blue check. I think even the corporate journalists are going [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3037.68s)]
*  to love this because if you're a New York Times writer, you'll have a little NYT badge next to [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3042.08s)]
*  your name, Wall Street Journal, whatever, you'll have that little badge. So more and more people [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3045.92s)]
*  are going to get blue checks and then people are going to have secondary or even tertiary badges [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3050.2400000000002s)]
*  that are basically specific to their affiliations. Okay. So I think let's make sure we get, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3054.96s)]
*  let's get an all in badge. We are going to have all in badges really soon. Awesome. Okay. Let's [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3060.16s)]
*  go for Freeberg. Freeberg's our biggest business surprises and we just canceled your account. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3065.04s)]
*  Freeberg, you're locked out. We just took away your, no one goes through it. Anyway, it's all good. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3070.96s)]
*  Don't worry about it. Okay. Best science breakthrough. Here's an easy one for us to do. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3074.7200000000003s)]
*  2022 biggest science breakthrough. What have you got? Sultan of science. We of course have to [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3079.68s)]
*  start with you. 22 biggest science breakthrough. Freeberg. Yeah. I'm going to give it obviously to [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3085.9199999999996s)]
*  the demonstration of net energy gain from the national ignition facility in plasma fusion [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3090.96s)]
*  that we talked about last week. I wouldn't call it a breakthrough, by the way. I think we, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3096.8799999999997s)]
*  we used that as a misnomer last week, but I'm still going to put it in this category. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3101.3599999999997s)]
*  It's more of a milestone, uh, along a very long path, a very arduous path, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3104.72s)]
*  a very difficult work that's been taking decades. So it's a great milestone, but I think what was so [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3109.3599999999997s)]
*  important and impactful and powerful about it is that it's really catalyzed a change, a sea change [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3114.16s)]
*  in the investing in the outlook that this is becoming more reality. As I mentioned last week, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3118.7999999999997s)]
*  we've seen an increase of nearly 40% in the number of fusion startups and the amount of [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3122.56s)]
*  capital that's flowing in is now reaching 10 billion a year. So this is becoming, you know, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3127.2s)]
*  a real investable or an area that's getting real investment. Some people might not think [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3131.04s)]
*  it's very investable, but that's why I think it's been an important year for fusion. And I think, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3134.96s)]
*  you know, it's something I highlighted last year. I was excited about it. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3140.64s)]
*  And I too picked fusion. Also just point of clarity. Last week, some people chamath before [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3143.12s)]
*  you go to your prediction, we're saying, Hey, you're talking your book on solar. When you were in [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3147.52s)]
*  your disagreement with Freeberg, that's obvious. You've been very upfront that you're investing in [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3150.32s)]
*  solar, you placed your bet. Yeah, 100%. Yeah. So just to everybody knows he made that bet. He's [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3155.76s)]
*  talked about it incessantly. Plus, those idiots that were saying that are stupid. But yes, let me, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3163.28s)]
*  let me further clarify what I said last week and why it's important if Nick, can you bring up the [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3169.6000000000004s)]
*  capital asset pricing model again, the most important thing for me is to make sure that we [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3173.92s)]
*  don't misallocate human capital into endeavors that I think are best left for research institutions [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3178.72s)]
*  funded by the government. And I think when you look at a capital asset pricing model and try to [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3186.56s)]
*  build one out for fusion, as an example, the expected rate of return that you need to get [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3191.3599999999997s)]
*  from this is just astronomically high, because of the beta of that investment risk, and the market [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3198.8799999999997s)]
*  risk premium you have to generate. And so, you know, from my perspective, I think that there [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3204.88s)]
*  are probably four or five labs in the world that are capable of actually getting us to a positive [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3209.84s)]
*  energy equation. I think Friedberg, I really thank you for actually saying that it wasn't a breakthrough [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3215.6000000000004s)]
*  and more of a milestone. I think the real breakthrough is when we have positive, not just jewels, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3220.48s)]
*  but we actually convert that into electrical energy, right? And we actually talk about power [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3225.6000000000004s)]
*  and Watts. And I think that most people listening probably don't even understand the difference [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3230.1600000000003s)]
*  between jewels and Watts or don't even care and they want to jump around here or there. So the [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3234.16s)]
*  point is that there's an enormous path we need to take in physics. And I think it's best done [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3238.56s)]
*  in governments. And I don't want to see a bunch of billions of dollars get wasted to get to get [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3243.8399999999997s)]
*  marginal cost of energy to zero right now. I think there is a point in time where private startups [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3249.12s)]
*  can take the last 20 or 30%. But I think about this like the internet, which is you need a DARPA [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3254.96s)]
*  to build V1. And then it could be handed over to private industry. And I think fusion when we look [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3260.72s)]
*  back, will look very similar. And all the folks that try to build, you know, versions of the [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3267.12s)]
*  internet that were private, I think found themselves lagging because there's just a level of investment [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3272.3199999999997s)]
*  that's required that's best served in government. So anyways, that's, let's clarify that for all the [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3277.12s)]
*  folks who got their panties in a bunch of years. But in any event, my science breakthrough of the [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3282.9599999999996s)]
*  year is that there was a 13 year old girl, this was, you know, because of all of this fusion stuff, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3287.28s)]
*  actually, we didn't even get to cover it because it happened in the same week. And I think this is [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3291.52s)]
*  infinitely more impressive and is an actual breakthrough, which is a 13 year old girl in [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3296.0800000000004s)]
*  the United Kingdom, who had a heretofore uncurable form of leukemia, T cell acute lymphoblastic [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3302.0s)]
*  leukemia. So typically, you start in chemotherapy. If chemotherapy doesn't work, you move to [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3310.6400000000003s)]
*  bone marrow transplants. And it was uncurable. And a lab in the UK, basically using CRISPR, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3316.0s)]
*  edited these transplant T cells to go in and wipe out her cancer. And now her cancer is literally [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3326.32s)]
*  undetectable. Now, if you bring up that capital asset pricing model, again, Nick, what I'll tell [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3333.44s)]
*  you is the rate of return on a human life, in my opinion, is infinite. And so here is an unbelievable [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3339.04s)]
*  breakthrough that got very little attention because everybody was wrapped around the axle of fusion. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3347.44s)]
*  It happened in the same week. So maybe it's understandable. I didn't understand it. But I [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3352.48s)]
*  think this is the single most important thing that happened in science, not just this year, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3356.96s)]
*  but frankly, in the last decade, because if you can actually now do base editing, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3361.2s)]
*  and eradicate, at least in this case, a blood base cancer, and eventually we'll be able to bring that [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3366.88s)]
*  and use that towards solid state tumor cancers. It's a huge breakthrough in just human longevity [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3373.7599999999998s)]
*  and human quality of life. And that happened just a few weeks ago. Okay. And of course, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3381.6s)]
*  for David Sachs, his biggest science breakthrough is I don't care. So moving on. Sachs, go ahead, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3387.52s)]
*  tell us. Yeah, no, this category reminds me of when Biden had that moment where he's like, [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3394.88s)]
*  America can be defined in a single word. And then he's like, that's kind of how I feel about this [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3400.56s)]
*  category. America is a nation that can be defined in a single word. I was gonna put him in, excuse me. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3406.0s)]
*  Amazing how you figured out a way to be derogatory about Biden in the science section, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3415.36s)]
*  a new low even for you Sachs. Oh, it's a good one Sachs. I like it. All right, biggest flash in the [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3420.16s)]
*  pan. 2021. This is what we said were the biggest flash in the pan. I said the woke socialist [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3426.56s)]
*  leadership of cities, i.e. Chesa Boudin. Freiburg said the constitution down. Sachs said the word [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3433.7599999999998s)]
*  transitory, very well played. And Chamath said the metaverse also very well played. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3440.72s)]
*  Everybody nailed that. Nailed it. Yes. Very good. Everybody get your flowers. Enjoy. All of those [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3445.68s)]
*  seem like pretty good selections. But this year is what everybody wants to hear about. Freiburg, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3451.52s)]
*  tell us now. Who is your 2022 biggest flash in the pan? The undisputable. Oh, here we go. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3457.44s)]
*  Biggest flash in the pan of 2022 was the All In Summit. Oh, wow. That hurts. It went. That hurts. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3463.68s)]
*  It'll always be a strong and significant memory. It was such a hot thing for a minute [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3472.56s)]
*  and then it died. So to the All In Summit, I used my glass. I pour one out. I toast to you, to Miami. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3477.6s)]
*  And unless David Sachs carries it from here, it was a flash in the pan. It was a flash in the pan. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3486.88s)]
*  Sachs, who's your flash? Which Democrat is a flash in the pan for you? [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3492.2400000000002s)]
*  This is where I had Liz Truss. As you guys mentioned, she only survived 44 days as PM. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3496.32s)]
*  I mean, that's only for Scaramoochies. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3502.48s)]
*  She was basically fired by the bond markets after she combined a Thatcher-esque tax cut [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3509.1200000000003s)]
*  with massive energy subsidies to counter the price spikes caused by the war in Ukraine that [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3514.6400000000003s)]
*  she was finaclty committed to. This was deemed untenable by the UK Central Bank. It crashed the [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3519.36s)]
*  pound. And I think there is a serious point here, which is that as much as Thatcher and Reagan were [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3524.24s)]
*  the two towering heroic figures of the 1980s, I think zombie Thatcherism is not going to be [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3530.8799999999997s)]
*  electorally viable in the UK, just like zombie Reaganism is not going to be viable in the United [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3535.9199999999996s)]
*  States. I think that the conservative movement has to stop living in the past. We have to develop [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3541.6s)]
*  fresh ideas to meet the economic and foreign policy challenges of today. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3546.16s)]
*  Trimoth, do you have a flash in the pan? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3550.24s)]
*  I actually think Fusion literally was a flash in the pan. It lasted 10 to the negative 10 seconds. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3553.4399999999996s)]
*  Less of a flash you can't have without being a flash in the pan. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3561.8399999999997s)]
*  Ah, they have it. Hey, Saks, I see somebody. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3564.64s)]
*  Oh, hey guys, look who's here. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3566.56s)]
*  Oh, look who it is. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3567.9199999999996s)]
*  Oh, is it the proprietor? [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3570.24s)]
*  The proprietor, the owner. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3572.16s)]
*  To our customer support at your service. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3573.6s)]
*  Saks, you spent the last 15 minutes selling your new features on the podcast. Pretty exciting. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3575.92s)]
*  Well, the views are incredible. I saw Dave Rubin already made an observation that if you look at [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3582.7200000000003s)]
*  New York Times, their views are maybe one-tenth like my views, just me as a lone tweeter. He said [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3590.7200000000003s)]
*  that their followers are inflated by just basically buying a bunch of follower accounts. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3597.28s)]
*  Yeah, the views thing is huge. That's why I pushed the views, which is actually a lot harder feature [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3601.28s)]
*  to implement than you'd think because the sheer number of transactions per second, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3606.88s)]
*  I think it sort of requires system-wide on the order of three million transactions a second [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3614.0s)]
*  to actually calculate and display the view count, FYI, for Twitter Global. So it's like [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3620.7200000000003s)]
*  three million per second. It's a lot. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3627.92s)]
*  For those of you listening, Elon Musk has had joined the pod. Elon, how's the first six weeks [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3630.72s)]
*  been, generally speaking, of owning Twitter? [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3636.64s)]
*  Well, it's been quite a roller coaster, which obviously you've [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3638.64s)]
*  witnessed and been on the roller coaster as well. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3642.9599999999996s)]
*  Yes, the dramamine, I've taken the dramamine. It's quite up and down. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3645.52s)]
*  I mean, it's exciting, but I think it sort of has its highs and lows, to say the least. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3648.9599999999996s)]
*  But overall, it seems to be going in a good direction. And we've got the expenses [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3655.6800000000003s)]
*  reasonably under control, so the company's not in the fast lane of bankruptcy anymore. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3663.28s)]
*  And we're releasing features faster than Twitter's history at the same time as having contained the [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3669.36s)]
*  costs and reduced the cost structure by a factor of three, maybe four. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3676.48s)]
*  So the verified is obviously, that's huge. It's a revenue stream as well as a means of [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3683.6s)]
*  identifying, of knowing that it's a real person and not a barter or trial situation. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3695.28s)]
*  The having the affiliation, organizational affiliation, which I suspect you talked about, [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3700.88s)]
*  that was an idea of David's that was great to have organizational affiliation. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3707.6s)]
*  So you can know that somebody is an actual professor at Stanford or [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3714.64s)]
*  that this particular handle is actually Disney, not someone simply putting, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3720.1600000000003s)]
*  I work at Disney in their bio. So I think that's going to be really helpful. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3723.92s)]
*  Just really just having detailed and nuanced verification. So of all the various things that [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3731.12s)]
*  you say you are, are these things validated by other people and organizations? [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3740.24s)]
*  Can you tell us how you do product iteration, Elon? Because one of the things that I think some people [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3744.56s)]
*  got jolted by over the last couple of weeks is like a bunch of things got taken away or changed [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3749.92s)]
*  or rules changed or policies changed and there was very quick action. And then people had all [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3754.72s)]
*  this negative feedback about the quick action without communication. But your extraordinary [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3760.0s)]
*  talent is to iterate product to success. Can you just maybe share with people how you do product [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3765.04s)]
*  iteration in this context to help them understand how some of these decisions get made and [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3770.64s)]
*  why moving quickly is so important and just how you're doing this? [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3775.84s)]
*  I'm a big believer in like, you want to look at the net output. So it's sort of like, [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3780.0s)]
*  you know, what's the batting average? If it's like baseball, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3784.64s)]
*  the point is not that you like, you know, hit the ball, but it's like, well, how many home runs you [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3792.08s)]
*  get and how like, what's your actual... Your slugging percentage. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3798.24s)]
*  Yeah, slugging percentage. Yeah, yeah. It's like, you're going to swing for the fences, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3801.44s)]
*  you're going to strike out a bit more, but we're going to swing for the fences here at Twitter. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3804.16s)]
*  And we're going to do it quickly. So, and I think generally, like my error rate, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3809.3599999999997s)]
*  and sort of being the chief twit, will be less over time. But, you know, in the beginning, [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3816.72s)]
*  we'll make obviously sort of a lot more mistakes. You know, because it's I'm new to the I'm like, [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3823.7599999999998s)]
*  hey, I just got here, man. So I mean, if you look at like the actual amount of improvement that's [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3831.8399999999997s)]
*  happened at Twitter in terms of like, so like, having costs that are not insane, and getting [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3837.36s)]
*  an actually shipping product that on balance is good. I think that is that that's great. Like, [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3845.36s)]
*  I think we're actually executing well and getting things done. I think we'll have fewer, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3852.96s)]
*  fewer gaps in the future. How did you get to your intuition on what the [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3859.04s)]
*  efficient frontier of employees needed to be to make the product better? [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3862.8s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3867.52s)]
*  Well, I observed part of this where you basically asked the question, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3875.2000000000003s)]
*  who here is critical? And who here is exceptional? [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3879.1200000000003s)]
*  Yes. I mean, so, I mean, it really the what the criteria is trying to apply, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3882.5600000000004s)]
*  and obviously, you're going to be perfect. If you're moving fast, and there's a lot of, [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3890.0s)]
*  you know, people you're talking about here is that anyone who is exceptional what they do, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3896.7200000000003s)]
*  where the role is critical, they have a positive effect on others. And they are trusted, meaning [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3900.7200000000003s)]
*  they put the company's interests before their own should stay pretty straightforward. Yeah. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3906.48s)]
*  And, you know, also, and also is up for working, you know, working hard, like, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3912.08s)]
*  that would not that would not just these that's not was not Twitter's prior culture. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3916.4s)]
*  Yeah, were you surprised that that the intersection of that circle, and the people that left was [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3924.4s)]
*  basically 25%? Were you surprised it was that deep? Or did you think your intuition was like, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3930.1600000000003s)]
*  it's probably somewhere in here? Well, I think you could just stand back and say, [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3935.44s)]
*  without knowing how many employees Twitter has at all, and say, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3939.04s)]
*  how many people are really needed to run Twitter? Like they say, you don't know what the [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3944.48s)]
*  playhead count number is at all. How many people are needed to keep the site operational? Like [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3949.84s)]
*  let's say, excluding product, product evolution, you basically have to keep the service going. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3954.88s)]
*  And you have to have customer sort of a support function to take down [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3960.96s)]
*  a material that is in violation of the law. How many people? What's the minimum number of people? [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3966.64s)]
*  That's in the hundreds, probably. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3974.96s)]
*  It's not exactly. It's not it's not like a giant number. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3976.64s)]
*  Yeah, Twitter still has like 2000 people, right? [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3979.44s)]
*  Yeah, we still have 2000 people. It's not nothing. And actually, if you this, there's actually on the [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3982.08s)]
*  order of like almost 5000 contractors. Like almost, yeah, almost all of the what's called [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3987.28s)]
*  trust and safety work, which is like the support functions for the site are done by contractors. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=3996.88s)]
*  You're doing a lot more to take down hate speech than the company previously was doing. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4004.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. Like hate speech impressions are down by a third and we'll get even [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4008.2400000000002s)]
*  lower. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4013.36s)]
*  Maybe you could speak a little bit to the what we discovered, I think in those early weeks, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4017.76s)]
*  which was the incentive. The incentive previously was to create as many accounts as possible. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4021.84s)]
*  And there were a lot of quick fixes to lowering all these, you know, what people might call [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4029.1200000000003s)]
*  bot accounts. In some cases, it was people opening many millions of accounts. But we discovered this [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4034.2400000000002s)]
*  very early. How easy was it for you with the tech team to maybe lower the bot count and all the fake [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4039.6s)]
*  accounts? Maybe you could speak a little bit to that because people have seemed to think that, [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4045.92s)]
*  gosh, it's a really hard thing to get rid of bots. And it turns out it isn't. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4049.68s)]
*  We still have a fair number of bots in the system. But the like, I think that the incentive structure, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4053.36s)]
*  the way Twitter set up previously was this relentless focus on what they called MDAL, [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4061.44s)]
*  which is Monetizable Daily Active Users, although I would say the monetizable part is dubious. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4065.36s)]
*  But at least things that appeared to be monetized or could be passed off as monetizable daily [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4073.52s)]
*  active users. So this, I created an incentive to turn a blind eye to fake accounts. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4078.32s)]
*  So if the incentive structure is like, you know, maximize the appearance of monetizable daily [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4085.76s)]
*  active users, then you're just, it's a strong incentive to pretend that a bot is real. And [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4092.64s)]
*  that's what happened. So we're taking a lot of steps to reduce the bots and troll situation. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4099.12s)]
*  So many. And I think you're saying that in the usage, like, it's not like relatively rare [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4110.96s)]
*  to have your applies filled with crypto scams. I'm not seeing any anymore. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4120.88s)]
*  Freeberg, you had a question. Yeah, I mean, just on your earlier [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4125.68s)]
*  question, you know, Elon, when you first started making changes at Twitter, after you bought the [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4128.24s)]
*  business, a lot of people kind of took notice at how extraordinarily swift and significant those [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4133.04s)]
*  changes were. Yeah. And there's a lot of technology companies that have CEOs and investors and boards. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4139.68s)]
*  And we all talk to a lot of them. And they're all now having a conversation like, look at what Elon [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4147.36s)]
*  did at Twitter. How can we do something as aggressive as swift as deep? Do you think much [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4152.32s)]
*  about kind of the model you're playing for other businesses and other business leaders, particularly [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4158.16s)]
*  in Silicon Valley and how you're operating Twitter? Do you ever kind of talk about that? [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4164.48s)]
*  Because I know you mostly talk about your business and you talk about the businesses you're running, [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4168.24s)]
*  but you're having a big influence, I think, and how other people kind of act and behave that are [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4172.32s)]
*  other business leaders and run other technology companies. I mean, to be frank, I'm not really, [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4176.16s)]
*  you know, active. I'm thinking about that much because I'm just thinking about like, how do we, [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4181.76s)]
*  I just like, you know, just get Twitter to be in a financially healthy place and fix the engine [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4187.2s)]
*  of engineering so we can have a rapid evolution of new products. So, and, you know, I mean, I guess [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4194.8s)]
*  I'm in sort of, in some ways, in a fortunate position where I don't have to answer, it's not [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4204.16s)]
*  public and we don't have a board really. So, I mean, so I can just go, you know, and I can [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4210.24s)]
*  take actions that are drastic. And obviously, if I make a bunch of mistakes, then Twitter won't [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4220.72s)]
*  succeed and that'll be pretty embarrassing and sad. But as long as, like I said, as long as the [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4232.24s)]
*  batting average is good, that the wins, you know, significantly outweigh the mistakes, then, you [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4240.0s)]
*  know, it'll be a great future. And I think I'm very optimistic about where things headed. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4251.679999999999s)]
*  I think a lot of people want to talk about or understand, Elon, your position on freedom of [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4255.68s)]
*  speech and your principles. I'm curious, you've been pretty upfront about it. How do you think [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4261.360000000001s)]
*  about it post acquisition? You know, what speech should be allowed on the platform? Kanye came back, [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4266.240000000001s)]
*  he just went insane. His account got revoked. What have you learned, I guess, now that you own it? [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4272.0s)]
*  Because you must be getting a lot of inbound from people asking you, hey, how are decisions going to [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4277.120000000001s)]
*  be made, etc. You've been clear transparency is super important in this. But what are your [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4281.84s)]
*  thoughts on free speech and speech on a platform like this? Well, I mean, the general principle, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4286.56s)]
*  I think, is that we should hear close to the law in any given country. So the law is very quite [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4291.4400000000005s)]
*  a lot by country. And so I think we should be doing free speech that's close to the law. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4295.84s)]
*  And that's the general principle. I think there are other things where it's like, okay, [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4306.24s)]
*  like, for example, like if you're an advertiser, you don't want your ad, like, let's say it's a [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4318.72s)]
*  family movie next to some, you know, NSFW content, even if that content is text, you know, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4326.08s)]
*  they'll be like, that's probably that's, you know, so that's, you know, part of what, you know, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4340.88s)]
*  like, so there's, there's more of an allowance for what you might what somebody call hate speech [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4349.2s)]
*  on the system. But it's just, it's not going to be promoted. It's not like we're not going to be [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4354.72s)]
*  recommending hate speech. It's just at risk of stating the obvious. And we're not going to [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4359.12s)]
*  monetize hate speech. So or negative speech, like that's no, what advertisers want us to, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4366.96s)]
*  you know, any, any, I think it's going to be a rare product that wants to be next to [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4376.16s)]
*  seriously negative stuff. I was gonna say you referred to it as, hey, freedom of speech, [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4380.88s)]
*  but not reach because this is a very nuanced discussion. Like, should this stuff be able to [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4384.32s)]
*  hit the trends, you know, in that kind of stuff? Like, it's only possible that some things that [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4388.16s)]
*  will be regarded as hate speech will hit will hit will hit trends. But I think it's going to be [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4392.16s)]
*  relatively unusual, especially as we are doing a better job of controlling the bots and trolls [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4396.4s)]
*  situation. And I do want to emphasize like there's a difference between bots and trolls, like bots [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4402.639999999999s)]
*  like fully automated accounts, but like a troll farm would be where you've got like, you know, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4408.08s)]
*  100 people in a warehouse somewhere each with 100 phones. And so they're actually humans, [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4412.16s)]
*  and they're going to pass a capture test or, you know, and they can, you know, reply, reply, [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4416.639999999999s)]
*  and they're because they're actually humans, but it's actually 10,000 [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4421.28s)]
*  accounts that are just there. They're obviously not operating as real people. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4426.639999999999s)]
*  So that's, you know, stuff like that can cause things to trend negatively. That's why I'm like [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4435.12s)]
*  a big proponent of having just a low cost verification capability. And yeah, so [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4440.64s)]
*  like this is definitely a work in progress. So there's, like I said, it's going to be and I [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4452.320000000001s)]
*  did like one of the first things I said, after the acquisition closed was like, we're going to make [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4458.160000000001s)]
*  a bunch of mistakes, but then we'll try to recover from them quickly. And that's, that's what we've [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4462.88s)]
*  done. And I think we've generally succeeded in recovering from them quickly. And it's been going [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4468.48s)]
*  pretty well. Was the Paul Graham and journalists suspensions mistakes from, have you talked about [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4477.36s)]
*  this publicly about how that all kind of got resolved at the end? Yeah, I mean, the program [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4482.08s)]
*  suspension was definitely a mistake and actually called programs apologize personally for that. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4486.48s)]
*  Yeah. So, you know, on the journalist front, the, I think the journalists, the suspensions [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4492.08s)]
*  were not a mistake in that for some reason, a bunch of journalists thought they were [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4498.5599999999995s)]
*  better than regular than everyone else. And that if they engage in doxxing and, you know, other [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4508.24s)]
*  and break the rules in various ways that they're not subject to suspension, even though your average [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4514.32s)]
*  citizen is, and I think that's just messed up. The same rules should apply to people who call [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4520.72s)]
*  themselves journalists as to, you know, anyone else on the system. They shouldn't be sort of [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4525.76s)]
*  above the rules for some reason they thought they should be that's that's that doesn't make sense. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4532.56s)]
*  I don't think that's right. Yeah. And the rules being transparent and upfront, I think that's what [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4538.24s)]
*  everybody's looking forward to maybe some just complete clarity and transparency. And you've [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4543.12s)]
*  said from the beginning, when somebody gets suspended or the shadow banning of this sort [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4547.92s)]
*  of with tips into this really weird stuff that we discovered during or you discovered [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4552.32s)]
*  where the journalists discovered during the Twitter files. It's it's kind of a bummer that [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4557.36s)]
*  people are being sanctioned or shadow banned. And they don't know it. If we're going to have a [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4560.96s)]
*  system, the rules should be clear to everybody. Yeah, absolutely. So the something I've committed [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4566.24s)]
*  to and we'll, we'll, we'll I think probably be able to roll that out in January. Just by the way, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4571.5199999999995s)]
*  there is like a bit of a, you know, we are not going to be rolling out a ton of new features [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4577.44s)]
*  over, you know, Christmas and New Year's and stuff. So there's like a, you know, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4581.6s)]
*  we'll, we'll, the next sort of feature set will probably roll out mid to late January. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4588.4800000000005s)]
*  And hopefully in that we'll, we can include information about why an account is suspended [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4595.280000000001s)]
*  or has what is called within Tesla, Twitter, visibility filtering, aka shadow banning. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4601.68s)]
*  So and some of these things like, are like this, there's a lot of things that just happen [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4613.360000000001s)]
*  accidentally where there's, you know, the rules in the system that are meant to detect [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4621.12s)]
*  whether someone's a sort of bot or troll or like brigading where they're like, you know, and then [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4627.52s)]
*  an account is sort of innocently caught up in that. So like there were some accounts just suspended [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4634.64s)]
*  yesterday because, but temporarily suspended. They got like 12 hour suspensions because [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4645.2s)]
*  someone in customers, someone in trust and safety thought that they had posted a nude photo of [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4651.68s)]
*  Hunter Biden or something. But they hadn't, they hadn't actually done that. I don't know, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4661.36s)]
*  it was just basically a mistake. There were some accounts that were, they got a 12 hour suspension [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4670.64s)]
*  yesterday for an error. And then they weren't sure why it happened. It was just essentially a mistake [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4675.2s)]
*  with Twitter customer support that was corrected. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4684.96s)]
*  Elon, let me ask you just a slightly broader question. One of the things we just talked about [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4686.96s)]
*  was the regime change that's happened where, you know, we all have to act differently now [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4692.08s)]
*  that the risk free rate is probably going to get to 5%. And I'm just curious across all your [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4698.08s)]
*  businesses, so Twitter, yes, but really more importantly, Tesla, SpaceX, are there decisions [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4704.0s)]
*  that you will make differently or not at all, or will make that you wouldn't have made otherwise [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4709.28s)]
*  in this new regime? And how often do you think about that kind of stuff? [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4714.64s)]
*  Well, I think it's more like, it does seem like we're headed into a recession here [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4721.6s)]
*  in 2023. The magnitude of that recession is debatable, but I think it's at least a [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4726.32s)]
*  light moderate recession, potentially it's on the order of 2009. So I think it's wise to kind of [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4732.64s)]
*  prepare for the worst, hope for the best, prepare for the worst. Don't get too adventurous, like [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4743.68s)]
*  watch out for margin debt. I would really advise people to not have margin debt in a volatile stock [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4749.84s)]
*  market. And, you know, from a cash standpoint, keep powder dry. You can get some pretty extreme [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4758.72s)]
*  things happening in a down market. Like Brad Johnson, who is a CFO of SpaceX was at [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4769.360000000001s)]
*  Broadcom in 2000. And he said that, and that's a good company making good products. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4780.320000000001s)]
*  And he said the prompt peak to trough, I think in less than 12 months, Broadcom went down 97%. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4785.92s)]
*  So like, even if you had a small margin loan there, you got you got crushed. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4794.400000000001s)]
*  It subsequently recovered and I think, you know, to much higher levels, but [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4799.52s)]
*  if there's like mass panic in the stock market, then you've got to really be careful about margin [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4805.2s)]
*  debt. So, but I mean, this is just as we know, this the economy is cyclic. So, [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4810.5599999999995s)]
*  and it's somewhat overdue for a recession. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4821.2s)]
*  And my best guess is that, you know, we have sort of stormy times for a year to a year and a half, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4826.32s)]
*  things start to dawn breaks, roughly in Q2 24. If I were to get this like my best guess, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4833.919999999999s)]
*  recessions don't like like booms don't last forever forever, but neither do recessions. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4849.839999999999s)]
*  And it's a 14 year boom. So a six quarter recession seems like that may that may [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4854.08s)]
*  actually bounce out the last time it was what four or five quarters. So it's not easy. Hey, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4858.72s)]
*  the Twitter files are how much longer are these going to go on? It seems like every week, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4866.16s)]
*  another drop. And these are pretty controversial. How much longer are the Twitter files going to go [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4872.4800000000005s)]
*  on? In your mind? Yeah. And maybe why is this important to you to make sure that people [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4879.2s)]
*  understand the stuff? Yeah, I think it's important to like, you know, if we're going to be trusted [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4885.84s)]
*  in the future to kind of clear the decks for stuff that's happened in the past. So I mean, [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4889.52s)]
*  to be totally frank, almost every conspiracy theory that people had about Twitter turned out to be [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4897.4400000000005s)]
*  true. So is there a conspiracy theory about Twitter that didn't turn out to be true? So far, [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4904.08s)]
*  they've all turned out to be true. And if not, more true than people thought. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4913.76s)]
*  Is there a part of the files that really shocked you more than the rest of them? Like of the things [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4918.64s)]
*  that have been disclosed? Of all of these things? Is there something that really sticks out with you [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4922.400000000001s)]
*  as like, holy shit, I had no idea this was happening? Or is the whole thing just a big dumpster fire? [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4926.400000000001s)]
*  They were just looking at one huge thing. Um, you know, like PsyOps versus the hunter Biden thing [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4933.12s)]
*  versus the? Yeah. The number of FBI people involved that was pretty intense. Yeah, the FBI [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4939.92s)]
*  PsyOps stuff to me was probably the one that was the most insidious. Like, the rest of it, I could [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4946.8s)]
*  think of like, you know, a bunch of overzealous libs got used. Yeah, got it. You know what I mean? [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4951.28s)]
*  Sure, sure. But to have like a secure skiff that essentially sends things that, you know, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4956.56s)]
*  government agents want the populace to basically think seems like kind of like a really bad [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4962.4800000000005s)]
*  dystopian novel. And then it turns out it existed. And then it also the thing is, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4968.4s)]
*  it couldn't have just existed at Twitter. So what are we gonna do about all the other places [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4973.5199999999995s)]
*  where this shit's happening? YouTube, Facebook. Yeah. None of it seemed that surprising to me. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4978.24s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, maybe I just believed all the conspiracy theories, but I've also been inside [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4983.5199999999995s)]
*  some of these companies and seen how they operate. So honestly, none of it was a surprise to me. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4987.759999999999s)]
*  Was it a big shock to you, Elon? Wait, wait, wait, you, you, Freeberg, you were, I think you can claim [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4992.719999999999s)]
*  that you weren't surprised that these companies were shadow banning, although they denied it. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=4998.08s)]
*  But did you really suspect that the FBI was playing a role in flagging content for these [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5002.08s)]
*  companies to take down? Like that blew me away. Content that's got nothing to do with like [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5008.5599999999995s)]
*  terrorism. Yeah, they're not investigating crimes. There's no crime. Right. Yeah, [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5013.44s)]
*  they literally flagged satire. Maybe they didn't get the joke. I don't know. But [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5017.6s)]
*  they don't seem to be a humor driven group, but they don't seem to have the best senses of humor. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5025.04s)]
*  But aren't they supposed to get warrants? Isn't that how it's supposed to work in a democracy? [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5031.44s)]
*  They want information. That's the thing that's troubling to me. Put yourself on either side of [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5036.64s)]
*  the extremes. We have Michael Schellenberger here who broke the FBI story in the Twitter files. So [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5042.88s)]
*  let's look at him and to see. Because I think maybe the audience isn't caught up on like what [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5048.48s)]
*  was discovered. So you know, I have to follow Elon Musk. That doesn't seem fair. Hey guys. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5054.0s)]
*  Hey guys. Hey, Michael. How are you? I'm good. Just a quick question for you. Michael, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5066.8s)]
*  first of all, first of all, who makes that sweater? [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5071.68s)]
*  I'll send you mine. Do you want it? Are you making fun of it? [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5075.28s)]
*  No, I'm asking. You're the master of sweaters. High praise from you, brother. High praise. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5078.24s)]
*  Just briefly, Michael, isn't the FBI supposed to get warrants to take actions with folks? And then [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5084.0s)]
*  I guess, is that at the crux of this? Are they doing this at other companies, you think? Are [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5090.64s)]
*  they just like embedded in YouTube? Should we expect they're embedded at Metta and that they [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5094.08s)]
*  don't get warrants and they're kind of tipping the scales? And is that a good thing for society [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5098.32s)]
*  or a bad thing for society? It's a bit of a basic question. Yeah. Well, I think there's a couple, [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5102.8s)]
*  there's multiple issues relating to FBI that I think have to be unpacked a bit. But the first [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5106.48s)]
*  one is that, yeah, FBI was constantly pushing the boundaries of what is legally and ethically [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5111.44s)]
*  acceptable in terms of requesting information. Now, I think what you saw over the last three weeks [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5117.839999999999s)]
*  was a shift in, I think, our own understanding that we did see more pushback from Twitter [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5124.16s)]
*  executives against FBI and some alarm bells being rung in terms of the requests that were [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5129.36s)]
*  being made from the intelligence community. But these guys were really persistent. They kept asking [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5134.96s)]
*  for more. They kept getting more and more cooperation. It's very troubling. It does look [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5140.24s)]
*  like Congress is going to look into this. The two heads of the committees that are tasked with this [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5144.32s)]
*  have said that they're going to look into it next year. I think the other thing that we saw that I [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5149.68s)]
*  think is more troubling was this persistent effort to basically communicate to Twitter executives, [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5153.84s)]
*  but also to news media, national security correspondents, that there was this heavy [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5161.28s)]
*  foreign infiltration going on, this Russian disinformation. And it appeared to me, looking [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5166.4s)]
*  at all the evidence both that we saw from within Twitter and from outside of it, that this was [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5172.16s)]
*  pretty organized effort to convince key executives at Twitter and Facebook, but also these key [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5176.24s)]
*  reporters, that they should expect a hack and leak operation sometime right before the elections, [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5182.719999999999s)]
*  having to do with Hunter Biden. I find that very suspicious. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5190.48s)]
*  Can I make an observation? I think that maybe what we're finding out is that the mainstream media [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5194.48s)]
*  tried to go back to its 1980 Cold War playbook and turn Russia into a boogeyman. But as we're [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5201.44s)]
*  seeing in the Ukraine war, they're not nearly the formidable foe that we thought they were. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5207.759999999999s)]
*  And so it could probably be the case that in 2016, they were as inept technically as they [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5213.679999999999s)]
*  are militarily right now. And so we may have just built up this monster that is kind of more like, [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5220.24s)]
*  you know, a much smaller thing to be worried about. And we all ran with it because we had [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5227.5199999999995s)]
*  no evidence. But the Ukraine-Russia war is evidence that, you know, this highly sophisticated war [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5233.36s)]
*  machine and propaganda machine is not that good at their job. Right. Yeah, I mean, I think that [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5238.16s)]
*  there's a lot of interest that were being served by hyping the so-called Russian misinformation [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5245.6s)]
*  threat. I mean, one of them was just to simply explain away the Trump phenomenon as a consequence [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5250.8s)]
*  of foreign interference. Certainly, the people that ran Hillary Clinton's campaign had an interest in [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5256.4s)]
*  doing that. But then you saw it become a sort of way, I think, to condition people for the release [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5260.8s)]
*  of the Biden laptop. And again, I can't prove that. But it is striking that the [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5267.92s)]
*  Yol Roth, this main Twitter executive, who I think was the object of this misinformation campaign, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5275.84s)]
*  testified under oath that he was being bombarded with these messages all throughout 2020 that they [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5282.0s)]
*  should expect some sort of a hack and leak operation. So when the New York Post finally [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5286.88s)]
*  did report on that computer in 2014, it was briefly censored by Twitter. But I think more [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5291.36s)]
*  importantly, it was discredited in the minds of many voters, including myself. I really didn't [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5297.92s)]
*  think that that laptop was what they said it was. And it turned out that it was. So I do think [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5303.599999999999s)]
*  there's a real troubling pattern of behavior by both the FBI agents, but also by the former FBI [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5309.599999999999s)]
*  executives, including the deputy chief of staff and the chief counsel from FBI that were at Twitter [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5316.16s)]
*  as executives at the time. And in fairness, Michael, this has been brought up many times. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5320.96s)]
*  But I just would like your take on it because you're a lifelong Democrat, correct? [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5326.72s)]
*  Until last year. Great. So, you know, just lest anybody [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5329.52s)]
*  think that you are like some MAGA supporter here. Just look at my sweater. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5333.84s)]
*  This was all in the backdrop of Trump asking for the Russians, you know, during that debate to hack [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5338.32s)]
*  Hillary for him interfering with Zelensky and trying to get him to give dirt on Biden. And the [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5343.44s)]
*  fact that Hunter Biden was obviously dirty. So to expect a hack, there was massive precedent for it. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5349.12s)]
*  So that set the stage for this, correct? For sure. And there is definitely that going [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5356.96s)]
*  on. And maybe that's all there was to it. It is just striking, of course, because I [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5362.72s)]
*  didn't even mention in my this was by the way, this is Twitter thread, part seven that I did on [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5368.08s)]
*  this issue. I didn't even get into the fact that, you know, within a few days, the many [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5372.72s)]
*  former senior heads of intelligence organizations and others came out and said that it was the [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5378.8s)]
*  result of a Russian disinformation campaign. So, yeah, sure. I mean, I guess we could find some [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5383.84s)]
*  other explanation for it, whether it was innocent or coordinated. But it is striking. Also, I think [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5389.04s)]
*  the other thing that we found was the contrast between the threat inflation and what Twitter [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5396.32s)]
*  was finding themselves. I mean, there was, you know, repeatedly, Yul Roth would respond to FBI [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5402.88s)]
*  that, yeah, we looked into these accounts that you mentioned, and they were all very low follower [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5408.48s)]
*  accounts with very little activity. So they just weren't finding very much foreign influence on [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5413.04s)]
*  the Twitter platform. And so I just think it was grossly inflated either for kind of good reasons [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5418.88s)]
*  or bad reasons. I would say. Yeah. Yeah. And it's there's no perfect way to police this stuff, [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5426.72s)]
*  obviously. And okay, well, listen, we appreciate your reporting. Thanks for doing it. And if you [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5432.64s)]
*  haven't read Michael's book, San Francisco, you did some great reporting there as well. And continued [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5438.32s)]
*  success in your investigative journalism career. Thank you, Michael. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5447.04s)]
*  All right. Sorry. Oh, lost him. It's all right. Well, he's still here. Oh, okay. Hey, you did an [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5451.92s)]
*  interview on that. I think I saw it on YouTube or something where you interviewed someone who was [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5459.28s)]
*  homeless in San Francisco and they were addicted to drugs and they kind of said some narrative about [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5463.68s)]
*  how they were in this condition because San Francisco basically pays them to be homeless and [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5468.96s)]
*  pays them to do drugs on the street. Did that ever get published? And did that come out? Because [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5474.48s)]
*  it was such a compelling couple of minutes that you got on tape there. It really, for me, sent [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5478.32s)]
*  home a message of how far kind of progressive policies can take a society. And it's such a beacon [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5482.959999999999s)]
*  for where things might go as other people start to think about adopting similar policies around [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5491.2s)]
*  the world, which is why I thought it was such important reporting. What ever happened with that [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5495.44s)]
*  and where can folks see that? Because it was such a moving interview for me. Yeah. If you just [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5499.599999999999s)]
*  Google Michael Schellenberger YouTube homeless, you'll be able to find all my videos. There's a [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5504.24s)]
*  lot of them that we did with people on the street. All of them, of course, people asking and wanting [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5508.08s)]
*  to do them. But yeah, I mean, I also wrote about that in my book, which is basically that San [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5513.04s)]
*  Francisco pays cash welfare payment of somewhere between six to $700. Plus you can get $200 in food [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5517.5199999999995s)]
*  stamps. And a lot of people sadly use that to maintain their addiction. And this gentleman, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5524.16s)]
*  James, with the tattoos on his face was very honest about how he was playing the system. In [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5530.72s)]
*  fact, he was himself. We found this increasingly kind of horrified by the incentives that San [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5536.8s)]
*  Francisco was creating for people to live on the streets and and live on the streets in their in [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5542.56s)]
*  their addiction. So yeah, you can find that on YouTube. So many people say incentives drive [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5547.2s)]
*  behavior. And unfortunately, these policies all came from a good place from a kind heart. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5551.4400000000005s)]
*  And the idea that we could help people in need. And unfortunately, the way that the incentives [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5557.28s)]
*  get structured, they can actually cause more harm than good. It's such an important lesson. I just [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5561.28s)]
*  wanted to say that because I think your reporting on this really hit that home. So thanks for doing [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5565.28s)]
*  that. I think it's really important because we have we have to do the right thing for people. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5570.32s)]
*  But we also have to be careful that the policies are done in the right way. So [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5573.679999999999s)]
*  so well said, Friedberg, because when you're Michael, and I just think you're very courageous [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5577.5199999999995s)]
*  for doing it, because it's very easy for somebody to say, Oh, well, you are being callous. The truth [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5583.52s)]
*  is incentives matter. And we saw we've seen this over and over again, if you pay for something, [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5588.0s)]
*  you get more of it. And really, San Francisco is bearing the burden. I think this is what your book [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5592.080000000001s)]
*  and you know, and a lot of the videos you've made, at least the message I got was San Francisco has [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5596.4800000000005s)]
*  the lowest price of drugs, the lowest enforcement, and the most incentives, therefore, they suffer, [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5601.4400000000005s)]
*  because every person who is, you know, addicted comes here, because they speak to each other. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5606.72s)]
*  And 90% of the people who are in San Francisco are here because we have created an incentive [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5612.64s)]
*  structure. Is that directionally correct? As we wrap here? Yeah, 100% correct. Including just the [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5616.96s)]
*  non enforcement of laws against sleeping on the sidewalk, doing drugs in public, not requiring [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5622.0s)]
*  ultimately three times more people die living outside as an unsheltered homeless person rather [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5628.08s)]
*  than live than being in a shelter. And for me, that's all you need to know to know that you [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5633.6s)]
*  usually cannot allow our brothers and sisters to sleep on the street, no matter how desperate they [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5637.76s)]
*  sound about wanting to avoid going inside. It's three times deadlier to be on the street than [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5642.24s)]
*  inside. So the compassionate thing is to force people into housing. Yes. And that's just very [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5646.639999999999s)]
*  tough for people to say. But you know, because you're we have this perception that people have [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5651.44s)]
*  freedom, and they should have the right to do this. But a person who's taking fentanyl in your [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5655.92s)]
*  research is not thinking correctly. And if it was any family member of ours, we would not want them [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5660.08s)]
*  to make that decision for themselves. We'd want somebody else to make that decision for them, [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5664.88s)]
*  correct? I would want that from if I was on the street so desperate that I was, you know, [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5668.24s)]
*  smoking fentanyl and breaking multiple laws every day, of course, I would want to be hospitalized. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5673.36s)]
*  You know, and usually, you know, people overcome their addiction. That's the good news, we always [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5678.5599999999995s)]
*  leave out of it. But it is possible people do overcome their addiction all the time. But they [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5683.04s)]
*  often need some some an intervention from family and friends. And if that's too late for that, [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5686.96s)]
*  then you need the intervention from the from the city. All right, Michael, thank you, Michael. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5691.599999999999s)]
*  Appreciate it. So as we get back to the all in news network, we've now gone 24 hours a day, [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5695.76s)]
*  the all in news network has launched. We'll just have a road to sit at various offices [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5702.400000000001s)]
*  throughout Silicon Valley, letting executives and CEOs. Imagine we did like a 12 hour marathon show [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5707.6s)]
*  for charity, where just people showed up and we did a what do they call those on TV? What is the [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5716.16s)]
*  charity by J Cal, the plane? Yeah, by J Cal. Yeah, no, no, just to get telephoned. J Cal has to [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5720.96s)]
*  still fly commercial. We'll do a telephone. Hey, Sax, thank you for setting up those amazing [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5728.0s)]
*  drop ins. Well done. Thanks, Sax. Thanks, Sax. That's your jacket. That's a great jacket. Is that [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5732.8s)]
*  custom? That is an East IA. Paul Stewart. East IA. This is the Christmas or holiday jacket. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5737.76s)]
*  Who is it by? East IA? It's Valentino. All right. Well, that's that's that's nice also. Okay. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5742.72s)]
*  No, it's not. Okay. Let's keep going here. We got to go to lightning round. All right, let's move [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5749.36s)]
*  biggest flash in the pan. We were was our last I went with crypto. Pretty easy to say that I'm not [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5753.68s)]
*  going to give myself a big high five. But what do you guys think of the Elon conversation real quick? [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5759.84s)]
*  Well, he's very talkative. And he's anything interesting or surprising for you? I mean, [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5763.68s)]
*  he said the biggest, you know, thing that people want to make sure to avoid is margin debt. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5767.36s)]
*  Oh, that was I mean, he's working hard. And he's just such a product, a focused guy. He just gets [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5771.52s)]
*  his he's like so deeply into it. It's like, yeah, just do the product wins, right? Friedberg. I mean, [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5777.12s)]
*  if anything, so my god, of course, that's it. That's it. Yeah. So I mean, and you know, [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5782.64s)]
*  products are made by teams. So what I think is distinctly different here, I'm just giving [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5788.32s)]
*  my personal opinion. I don't have a Microsoft Teams. No, no, no. Teams make products. And so [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5792.4s)]
*  what I just want to say here is, you know, like the Microsoft team suck. No, that I'm not, you know, [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5797.84s)]
*  don't trigger the bundle. But I just want to say, you know, like, this is a takeover, [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5802.24s)]
*  as opposed to building a company from scratch, he's had to assemble a team, and then work at this [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5807.28s)]
*  incredible product pace. And I think those two things are starting to click week. Yeah, 16 is [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5812.32s)]
*  gonna look very different than week the first six weeks. So yeah, the products already looking [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5817.92s)]
*  awesome. And it was nice of him to give me that shout out on the you know, the affiliate badges, [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5821.76s)]
*  but I'll just give a shout out. I didn't hear it. What was it? Oh, well, he gave me he gave me some [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5826.16s)]
*  credit for the affiliate badges. But I wanted to give credit to the PMs who approached me about [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5830.88s)]
*  that idea troll. I went again. Okay, fine. Whatever is there? Let me give me give credit to the actual [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5836.0s)]
*  PMs, Evan Jones and Patrick Trauger, who they approached me about this idea they had, and then [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5842.4800000000005s)]
*  I helped, you know, give it some momentum. Here's the truth. When Dave and I spend the first couple [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5848.32s)]
*  weeks there, now that it's a little more public, he was been on the program. What we found over and [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5853.76s)]
*  over again, was that there were great features that were ready to be released, that were being [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5858.4s)]
*  held back by management. And there were brilliant people with all the ideas that you think should [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5862.719999999999s)]
*  have been released. And they just weren't allowed to release a lot of these products. Why? Who knows, [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5867.28s)]
*  but now that he's in charge, I think you'll see the product cycle is going to go much quicker. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5873.04s)]
*  The most important thing I saw, which is such an important lesson for anyone running a business in [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5877.28s)]
*  Silicon Valley is that the pace of decision making matters far more than the accuracy of decision [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5881.04s)]
*  making. It's always been like one of my three big mottos. Say more about that for entrepreneurs. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5886.48s)]
*  For me, like my number one, like my three things are always like grit, bias to action, and then [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5891.839999999999s)]
*  narrative. But like bias to action, the rate at which you can make decisions is a far greater [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5896.0s)]
*  predictor of success than the accuracy of the decisions you do make. And so you have to be [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5901.36s)]
*  willing to embrace failure, you have to be willing to make decisions that could result in something [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5906.0s)]
*  not being done correctly or making a mistake. And even getting embarrassed on the internet, [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5910.08s)]
*  by making mistakes and having to call people like Paul Graham and apologize for them. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5914.24s)]
*  And that was a big moment. But as a business scales, as professional managers are brought in, [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5917.68s)]
*  their incentive is to not make mistakes. Their incentive is to do things that are predictably [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5925.84s)]
*  going to work and are predictably not going to fail. And therefore they avoid taking the risks [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5930.56s)]
*  and they reduce the rate of action, the rate of decision making. And that's why so many businesses [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5934.88s)]
*  ultimately don't scale past some sort of inflection point or when founders that are willing to push [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5939.2s)]
*  that envelope step out, everything starts to fall apart. And it's so critically important, [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5943.68s)]
*  I think, to look at that as being, I think, Elon's defining trait and characteristics that [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5948.0s)]
*  regardless of the scale of the organization and the enterprise, he's still willing to act [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5952.240000000001s)]
*  with that level of bias to action that you typically see in a small startup. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5955.92s)]
*  Okay. And put his reputation on the at risk. Yeah. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5959.84s)]
*  I sat in a meeting yesterday. He said that if we're not rolling back 10% of the time, [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5965.360000000001s)]
*  we haven't pushed hard enough. Right. Wonderful. There you go. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5972.16s)]
*  I mean, it's like if you're never rolling anything back because you never make a mistake, [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5975.5199999999995s)]
*  maybe you're just not moving fast enough. You don't have enough. You're not fast enough. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5979.36s)]
*  Enough of a bias towards action. You're too afraid of making a mistake. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5983.599999999999s)]
*  By the way, here's what's so interesting about the views feature is that a bunch of websites, [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5986.88s)]
*  I think it started because Instagram did a bunch of apps deprecated, you know, likes, [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5992.08s)]
*  because they felt that it was too. It was part of this negative cycle. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=5996.8s)]
*  And so they took all this stuff away. And basically views is going sort of back in that [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6003.28s)]
*  direction and giving more granularity in terms of outside in social engagement on a post, [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6010.16s)]
*  which is I think interesting to see it's happening in a moment where all these other sites [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6015.84s)]
*  and apps are actually going in the opposite direction. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6019.84s)]
*  Well, it's like a standard feature on YouTube. And it's very powerful for YouTube's network [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6022.08s)]
*  effects because it shows you how many views you get. So it discourages people from using [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6027.28s)]
*  other sites because you know, you get the most distribution on YouTube. So it's weird that [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6032.32s)]
*  other social networks don't want to follow suit. I mean, in one hour, [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6037.76s)]
*  they had it, but they deprecated. That's what's so interesting. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6041.12s)]
*  But I guess, you know, my point is we've only had this feature for an hour and I didn't realize [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6043.68s)]
*  how much distribution my tweets were getting. And it definitely undermines my incentive to want to [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6048.16s)]
*  go use some other platform when I see the distribution I'm getting on Twitter. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6052.639999999999s)]
*  Well, if you're getting 10 times more distribution than the New York Times, [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6056.639999999999s)]
*  you know what's going to happen is people will stop listening and reading. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6059.12s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's sort of like this podcast itself. Like, I mean, people ask us to go. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6061.5199999999995s)]
*  My point is we have to rely on social proof and anecdotes about the actual scale and the [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6066.96s)]
*  breadth and the reach because it's impossible for us to get one holistic view that shows across all [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6073.84s)]
*  of these different modalities, whether it's Spotify or Apple podcasts or YouTube, how many people [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6079.12s)]
*  listen or watch and you know, we add it all up and you know, we think it's in this, [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6085.2s)]
*  you know, sort of three to 5 million range of people. But if you just had a numerical [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6089.92s)]
*  canonical number that was irrefutable, you just run over everybody. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6095.6s)]
*  This turns it into a meritocracy is gonna be terrifying to some blue check marks when [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6099.52s)]
*  they see that the people who they report on get 10 times as many views as they do. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6103.6s)]
*  Of course, when when journalists look at Sean Hannity, go to Sean Hannity's profile and for [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6108.64s)]
*  the number of followers he has help authentically engaged his audiences. It's all bots. It's all [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6114.08s)]
*  trolls. It's all nobodies. I looked at Mitt Romney just put out a video, [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6118.56s)]
*  whatever in the first like half hour, he had 100,000 views like every politician who starts [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6121.92s)]
*  seeing this is going to go wait a second, the world is getting more views here than I am on [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6126.4800000000005s)]
*  MSNBC or Fox, the world is a more rational place if Mitt Romney actually has more influence [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6130.08s)]
*  than Sean Hannity. Let's hope Okay, let's move on. We got to get through this quickly. It's our [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6135.68s)]
*  longest episode ever. Here we go. We are going to do next up. It's very this is a very important [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6140.16s)]
*  category best CEO of 2022. In 2021, I went with Frank Slootman and Elon Musk. Chamath went with [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6148.08s)]
*  Satya Nadella. Sax went with Brian Armstrong and Freberg went with Jack Dorsey. Now we go on [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6157.04s)]
*  to 2022. Sax who everybody wants to know Sax is best CEO of 2022. Go ahead, Sax. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6163.76s)]
*  Every founder took my advice to get leaner, slow down their burn, create runway, you know, [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6172.8s)]
*  weather the storm down, you know, generic answer, not a person. Yeah, exactly. I mean, look, I think [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6178.64s)]
*  actually a lot of the names, a lot of the names. Well, here's the problem is that, you know, [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6184.32s)]
*  yeah, can I finish J.K.L.? The names that you mentioned from last year would be the top candidates [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6189.36s)]
*  for this year. I mean, I think Satya Nadella had a good year. Obviously, what Elon's doing, [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6194.0s)]
*  we just talked about. It's amazing. Brian Armstrong, I think the stock hasn't done great, [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6198.0s)]
*  but he's been a strong CEO. But I don't want to repeat the same names. I think that, [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6202.24s)]
*  you know, every CEO who responded to the regime change by cutting costs, getting leaner, extending [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6206.16s)]
*  runway. I think deserves to be on this list. And unfortunately, a lot of them are just resisting [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6211.44s)]
*  and they're just not yet taking the medicine or they've been taking the medicine in little drips [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6217.599999999999s)]
*  and drabs instead of just like swallowing it whole and getting a move on. Yeah, just drink the whole [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6222.96s)]
*  two tablespoons of medicine. Don't sip it. You got to just take it. It's not getting better. I mean, [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6228.24s)]
*  the stock market today should be a wake up call. I mean, this is one of the worst days in the market [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6232.799999999999s)]
*  the whole year. So things are getting worse before they're getting better. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6239.28s)]
*  Chamath, who is your best CEO of the year? [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6242.88s)]
*  Well, the numerical answer is Vicky Hollub, who's the CEO of Occidental Petroleum. Stock's up like [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6245.44s)]
*  140% this year. It's technically the best performing stock of the year. $63 billion company. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6250.5599999999995s)]
*  But that's just a numerical answer. I actually want to double down on David's answer, [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6258.16s)]
*  because I agree with that. I have been guiding our portfolio company CEOs to be at cash flow [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6264.72s)]
*  break even now or extend runway to Q1 2025. And they're 25. Yes, because I mean, I think, [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6272.64s)]
*  you know, I call Elon and I are kind of roughly in the same place we have been for a while, [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6281.6s)]
*  which is like, you know, mid 24 is when the recession ends. And you need to give yourself [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6285.04s)]
*  two to three quarters of buffers so that you can go and raise around which takes a quarter to two [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6289.28s)]
*  quarters. And once you start to get kind of get escape velocity out of a recession, having money [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6293.36s)]
*  through end of Q1 2025, I think is a is a minimum requirement. And, you know, of the companies that [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6299.36s)]
*  I think were the most precariously positioned, there was five of them that got their acts together [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6308.32s)]
*  and really did it. But these are all CEOs of companies that you know, I mean, if you said [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6315.2s)]
*  them, you would know some of them. But I do agree with David, I think the CEO that bit the bullet, [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6320.48s)]
*  so maybe publicly, what I would say is, you know, the CEO of carna deserves a huge, [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6324.879999999999s)]
*  you know, medal for having the courage to do it before anybody else did the CEO of checkout.com [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6332.719999999999s)]
*  just took a huge right down. These CEOs are making sure their companies survive. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6336.48s)]
*  Friedberg, best CEO 2022. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6340.799999999999s)]
*  My vote for best CEO is Warren Buffett. And I think it is just simple arithmetic. He has for [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6345.12s)]
*  years and now for decades proven himself to be just not just an exceptional investor, stock picker, [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6353.599999999999s)]
*  whatever the kind of typical quip is about what he does for a living. But I think what's so [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6360.8s)]
*  extraordinary about Buffett is that regardless of the market conditions, he can kind of remain [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6366.32s)]
*  steadfast in his intent and in his mission. And he doesn't kind of waiver. And, you know, [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6371.52s)]
*  he doesn't take an active role in ranting and complaining about markets and politics. And I [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6377.84s)]
*  think that that's what makes him such an extraordinary leader. He stays within his [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6383.200000000001s)]
*  zone of competence. He doesn't do things that he doesn't know about. He doesn't let the macro [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6386.320000000001s)]
*  drive him and cause him to be kind of, you know, affected by it. And he says, this is what I know [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6391.280000000001s)]
*  how to do. This is what I can do. And that is all that he does do. And he does it so exceptionally [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6396.4800000000005s)]
*  well. And to Chamath's point, he is the largest shareholder of Occidental Petroleum, along with [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6401.04s)]
*  many other incredible businesses. And I think he's proven in a market like we just had this year, [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6405.44s)]
*  why he is kind of the most extraordinary CEO, or one of the most extraordinary CEOs, but one of the [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6410.8s)]
*  best kind of capital allocators of all time. I'm going to go in a similar fashion as Chamath [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6415.84s)]
*  and Sachs and go with the money losing CEOs who have dedicated themselves to free cash flow [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6423.04s)]
*  and to getting to profitability from the last cycle Airbnb and Uber were the money losers. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6430.72s)]
*  And now Airbnb is my number one, they become a money printer. They are now making bank. And [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6435.68s)]
*  they're still growing very quickly. And then Uber I put in my second, they need to do another riff, [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6443.44s)]
*  they need to cut some expenses, but they too are hitting the free cash flow and the network effects. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6449.12s)]
*  So I'm giving it to Chesky and then Dara. One and two. Okay, let's keep moving. Best investor. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6453.84s)]
*  For me, I'm going with the investors, like a general category, who are demanding governance [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6460.64s)]
*  and doing diligence again, or who never stopped. Let me say it that way. There's a generation of [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6467.84s)]
*  investors who raised their funds in the last five years and didn't do diligence, didn't demand [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6473.76s)]
*  board seats, didn't demand boards. Those idiots are now paying the price and they created a lot [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6478.5599999999995s)]
*  of this mess of entitlement and a lack of governance. I want to give a shout out to the Bill Gurley's [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6485.12s)]
*  of the world who fought for governance and fought for diligence in the face of being told, okay, [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6490.08s)]
*  boom, or you don't get it. Who do you have? Best investors, Chamath Palihapitiya. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6496.0s)]
*  Chesky I will pick the what are called the pod [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6501.36s)]
*  shops. These are folks that have strategies where they have hundreds of investing pods [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6504.24s)]
*  underneath an umbrella and they have this very sophisticated risk infrastructure. This is what [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6510.0s)]
*  Ken Griffin owns in Citadel. This is what Izzy Englander owns in Millennium. Brevin Howard is [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6515.679999999999s)]
*  another one. D.E. Shaw is another one. They have all kinds of strategies, but that are essentially [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6522.08s)]
*  run by computers that allocate risk, scale you up, scale you back, turn you on, turn you off, [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6529.28s)]
*  fire you overnight. And those strategies as a whole ran over the market this year. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6535.36s)]
*  They were the best performers. They are giving back billions of dollars. They've generated [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6541.12s)]
*  double digit positive returns. They're raising their fees. In some cases, some of these folks [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6546.4s)]
*  are moving their annual fee up to 4% a year. Their carry up to 40% a year. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6552.4s)]
*  Incredibly, incredibly well run performant businesses. They were by and away the best [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6558.0s)]
*  investors this year. Okay, we're going to go lightning round from here. Sax, do you have a [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6564.4800000000005s)]
*  best investor? Yeah, I said Stan Druckenmiller. He, as you recall, last year, he predicted that [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6570.160000000001s)]
*  inflation would be lasting. This was the spring of 2021 when transitory was the word of the day. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6576.160000000001s)]
*  This year, he predicted the bear market rally we had in July and August. And I remember back at the [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6582.08s)]
*  Co-2 Summit in May, there were around that time, he was interviewed and he basically was saying [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6590.4800000000005s)]
*  that as soon as there was a bear market rally over the summer, that he would then put a short [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6595.76s)]
*  position on. I don't know if he actually did that, but he said he's going to do that. And then [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6601.120000000001s)]
*  it turns out that the summer rally that we had was a dead cap bounce. So he was right about that. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6604.96s)]
*  And now he is predicting a hard landing in 2023 with a deeper recession than many expect. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6609.84s)]
*  So sadly, I suspect he may be right yet again. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6617.04s)]
*  Friedberg, best investor for you, 2020. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6620.4800000000005s)]
*  Today, I had Druckenmiller, I indicated that he's been doing interviews pretty much every quarter [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6622.56s)]
*  for the last two years. And he's been pounding the table telling everyone what's going to happen. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6627.28s)]
*  And it all happened. And he even told people the trades in mid 2021. He said he was short, [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6630.24s)]
*  long dated treasuries, and he was long commodities. And if you had put those two trades on at that [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6635.12s)]
*  time and held them to today, you would have made a fortune. And so I think he's extraordinary in his [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6639.68s)]
*  ability to kind of see macro in a way that others don't, but also to take extremely brave action [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6645.04s)]
*  with his portfolio. He's renowned for how big the bets are that he makes, and how quickly he can [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6650.08s)]
*  change his mind when he's wrong and make another big bet to and still get himself out of the hole. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6655.28s)]
*  He's incredible. So I definitely give it to Stanley Druckenmiller this year. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6659.5199999999995s)]
*  2021 we did our best turnarounds. I picked Disney, Chamath Ford, [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6662.88s)]
*  Friedberg, we were sacked. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6668.8s)]
*  Should we stick this category? What about the worst investor of 2022? Can we do that? [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6670.24s)]
*  Good Chamath, you want to freestyle? Tell us your worst investor of 2022. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6675.28s)]
*  I mean, I'll put myself in the category along with anybody else who was long tech. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6678.16s)]
*  Base Dave Nick, if you can just bring please back up this capital asset pricing model. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6682.16s)]
*  Any of us that didn't understand this got run over this year. And just to put some very specific [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6687.76s)]
*  numbers here. There was a decent little tweet thread that Elon was a part of where he actually [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6694.32s)]
*  calculated what the expected rate of return of Tesla was, and it turned out to be almost 14% a [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6700.5599999999995s)]
*  year. And so, you know, when you start to compound 14% over three, four, five years, these numbers [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6706.88s)]
*  get very big very quickly. And the reason why is that it has a huge beta. And we're in a world now [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6713.44s)]
*  where the risk free rate is quite high. So all of us benefited from this equation, essentially being [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6720.16s)]
*  upside down for the last 15 years. And all of us who were over allocated into things that benefited [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6726.96s)]
*  from those dynamics, frankly got run over this year. So we were, as a class, the worst investors [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6734.08s)]
*  of 2022. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6740.719999999999s)]
*  Okay, here we go. Let's do our best turnaround. I am going to go with me for me, it's meta. They [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6741.6s)]
*  were losing money. handover fist, they refuse to do a rift. And then finally, bestie Brad Gershner [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6750.08s)]
*  said, let's get fit. He did a memo. And finally, finally, Zuckerberg made some cuts. Reportedly, [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6757.120000000001s)]
*  rumors he's making a 1510 or 15% cut I heard in the back channels right now based on performance. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6764.08s)]
*  So he's not calling it a riff or a layoff. They're just gonna cut the bottom 10 or 15% again. So I [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6770.24s)]
*  think zucks gonna turn it around. Anybody have a best turnaround? So you're saying Zuck mission [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6775.599999999999s)]
*  accomplished? You turn around this year. I'm going with meta. So your answer is meta was turned around [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6781.12s)]
*  by Zuck this year? Yes, they got down to $85. And now they're up at 110 115. Yes, he turned it around [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6788.8s)]
*  at the end of the year. It was like a Hail Mary at the end of the year. He's turned it around. I [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6795.12s)]
*  think he's going to continue to Yes, that is my position. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6798.08s)]
*  Listen, I bought the stock at 94. Go with that, Jacob. Okay, so if we're talking about very [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6803.92s)]
*  partial turnarounds here, I would say I would say that you can measure the turnaround as of [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6808.32s)]
*  October 24 to now. Yes, exactly. So San Francisco is still overall a mess. But there were a few [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6814.96s)]
*  positive events that happened over the past year. And since we're looking back, we should call these [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6822.64s)]
*  out. So first of all, back, this is towards the beginning of the year, we recalled three members [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6827.12s)]
*  of the school board, most particularly, Alison Collins, remember her? This was done by something [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6832.16s)]
*  like a 70-30 margin and 80-20 on Collins. This was the school board that had dragged its feet on [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6838.64s)]
*  school reopenings. They destroyed the Merrick-based Lowell High School. They wasted hours of meetings [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6846.08s)]
*  on a silly plan to remove the names of names like Abraham Lincoln from the schools. In any event, [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6852.16s)]
*  they were removed. Then, J Cal, you referred to this. We got Chase Aboudin recalled the bias [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6858.24s)]
*  60-40 margin as San Francisco DA. This was the DA whose agenda was decarceration. He tried to [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6863.84s)]
*  release as many repeat offenders as possible. The voters of San Francisco had enough. And then [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6870.96s)]

*  This November, and the new tough DA, Brooke Jenkins, got reelected in her own right after [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6881.6s)]
*  being appointed by London Breed. So there's still a long way to go in San Francisco, but there are [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6887.84s)]
*  definitely some green shoots that the electorate here has had enough and is looking for the, [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6892.96s)]
*  let's say, called the centrist Democrats as opposed to the radicals. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6898.88s)]

*  Fine. Okay. Yeah, we're a little split on this. Freeberg, you got anything? [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6929.68s)]
*  I'll just go with your incisive fucking viewpoint and I'll pick Zock and Meta. That makes so much [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6932.5599999999995s)]

*  worst human being. For this year. I mean, not ever, but just for- [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6970.8s)]
*  Only for this year. Right. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6974.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. We all hate you equally. Okay. Who's number two? Why do you hate him? [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6976.56s)]
*  Why do I hate him? Because all those people lost their money. And, you know, there's some, [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6980.96s)]
*  it's causing chaos. I feel terrible for all these people who lost money. That's why I hate him. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6985.6s)]
*  Oh, that's disgusting. Did you see that? [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6990.0s)]
*  Anybody have a second most loathing person? Did you see that the two guys copped to please [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6992.8s)]
*  Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang? They flipped like pancakes. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=6996.96s)]
*  They flipped. But it turns out that they actually did engineer a backdoor into FTX and Alameda has [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7000.4s)]
*  been doing this for years. Oh my God. Oh my God. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7006.4s)]
*  That's game over. You're getting 10 years. He's getting life game over. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7010.4s)]
*  Well, there's interesting defense strategy that we were discussing in the chat. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7014.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. I think this is actually a fascinating defense strategy. I think this is their only shot. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7019.84s)]
*  One of our besties had this theory that he was prescribed two prescription drugs. One was Adderall. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7024.96s)]
*  What was the other one called? This was not a drug. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7030.72s)]
*  ESAM? The patch. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7033.44s)]
*  It's a drug I wasn't familiar with. I guess it's a patch, but when you combine these two things, [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7035.68s)]
*  apparently it basically shuts down or kills the part of your brain that deals with- [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7040.08s)]
*  Inhibition. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7046.4s)]
*  Inhibition. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7047.04s)]
*  It's cocaine. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7047.68s)]
*  What if his defense strategy was, yeah, only an insane person would do this, [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7048.96s)]
*  and I was acting insane because I was prescribed these drugs that had these drug conflicts, [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7054.4s)]
*  and it killed part of my brain. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7059.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. What if every criminal on Wall Street said, cocaine is my defense? [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7061.6s)]
*  But this, you could say maybe he was legally prescribed if he could show the prescription. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7066.64s)]
*  By the way, I'm not saying this should get him off. We're basically workshopping what [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7070.96s)]
*  his only shot of his defense would be, right? [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7076.88s)]
*  Well, and think about it, Sax. He acted manic after FTX collapsed. So that mania [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7079.4400000000005s)]
*  of doing 20 Twitter spaces would be evidence. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7087.12s)]
*  There's something so insane about what he did, right? It's almost like [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7090.400000000001s)]
*  a prescribed insanity defense. I was prescribed a drug combination that made me insane. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7096.8s)]
*  Anybody have a most loathsome company as we wrap? [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7103.52s)]
*  The only way that you could come up with that is you'd have to have two parents that were [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7105.92s)]
*  law professors or something. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7109.360000000001s)]
*  All right. Most loathsome company FTX for me. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7111.84s)]
*  What if this is his defense? [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7114.16s)]
*  My parents, boohoo. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7116.400000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, no. He'll claim insanity, J. Cal. He'll say- [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7118.8s)]
*  Of course, yeah. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7121.2s)]
*  And they'll have a, I mean, do we think that his parents aren't going to help his defense? [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7122.4s)]
*  At this point, this kid's got to go away for life. That's it. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7128.48s)]
*  You think life? Wow. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7131.759999999999s)]
*  I think it's got to be life. I think it's got to be 30 plus years. I mean, it's just [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7133.36s)]
*  going to be billions of dollars. What kind of justice system do we have when people go [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7136.799999999999s)]
*  away for 20, 30, 40 years? [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7140.5599999999995s)]
*  How many years per billion would you sentence? [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7141.759999999999s)]
*  A decade per billion, at least. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7146.4s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, just you got to put it proportional. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7149.04s)]
*  That's 100 years. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7150.799999999999s)]
*  Sax, don't you think the justice system needs to look at other people who are in jail [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7151.92s)]
*  for selling cocaine, for selling marijuana, for robbing a convenience store? They'll put [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7156.4s)]
*  somebody away for robbing a convenience store for a decade or two. What are they going to [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7162.0s)]
*  put him in jail for? Just because somebody came in with a gun and robbed a convenience store, [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7166.08s)]
*  they get 20 years. This kid's going to get off? Screw that. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7169.2s)]
*  Look, I think, what do you guys think the over under is here? [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7172.16s)]
*  You think it's life? [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7174.96s)]
*  I'll set it at 35 years. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7176.4s)]
*  I think 30. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7178.56s)]
*  I'll take the over. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7179.6s)]
*  I'll take 30. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7180.48s)]
*  I think 30 is the over. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7181.28s)]
*  I think this is made off level. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7182.24s)]
*  I set a good line then. What's yours, Friberg? [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7183.5199999999995s)]
*  I think this is made off level. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7185.36s)]
*  No, I agree. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7186.48s)]
*  Over on 30. Yeah, I think it's going to be multiple hundreds of years sentenced. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7186.959999999999s)]
*  I agree. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7192.799999999999s)]
*  And you'll be gone for life. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7193.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's going to be life, but I set a good line. Okay. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7194.5599999999995s)]
*  Most loathsome company is FTX. Anybody want to go for a second? [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7197.44s)]
*  No, let's keep moving. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7200.799999999999s)]
*  No, I'll add one. This year, I'm going to give my, last year I gave it to Tyson Foods, [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7202.0s)]
*  one of the largest slaughter of animals on earth. This year I'm going to give it to a [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7206.32s)]
*  company called Innotiv. This is the company that was busted by the feds for their animal abuse in [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7210.16s)]
*  their dog breeding facility where 4,000 beagles were rescued, one of which I adopted. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7217.84s)]
*  And this is a publicly traded company, stocks down 90 some odd percent, which I'm thrilled to see. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7223.36s)]
*  Terrible business, awful, awful kind of, you know, inhumane behavior. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7227.92s)]
*  And so I want to kind of give them a special shout out this year. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7233.68s)]

*  I'm going with fusion for best new tech. I'm going with I'm going to go with chat GPT. I think what [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7296.24s)]
*  was so impressive about chat GPT and the experience that everyone's had using it is that it really, [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7300.5599999999995s)]
*  for the first time, I think, elucidated where these kind of machine learning tools can take us [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7307.2s)]
*  and what the kind of new product experience can be, what generative AI can yield things beyond, [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7313.92s)]
*  I think, the scope of what a lot of people were imagining before. So it was really so revealing. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7319.52s)]
*  And as you guys know, there's an absolute friggin tidal wave of people trying to start companies [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7323.68s)]

*  enterprise software, all the way through to media games and entertainment. So that's why I think [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7334.8s)]
*  chat GPT was the most impressive new technology tech of 2020. And then sex lightning round, please. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7339.040000000001s)]

*  excess. That's the best trend in our world. The age of austerity, what's your best trend [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7366.24s)]
*  for 2022? Marginal cost of energy generation and storage is now in the low single digit pennies [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7370.08s)]
*  per kilowatt hour, which basically means that not only will energy be free and abundant, but it will, [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7376.5599999999995s)]
*  I think over the next decade or two, create a massive peace dividend, it will rewrite our [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7382.719999999999s)]
*  foreign policy, it will rewrite national security. That is the reason why people should care about [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7388.08s)]
*  energy transition, not necessarily climate change. Although that's important, it's a distant second [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7393.92s)]
*  to keeping men and women out of war and keeping our borders safe. Well said. Anybody else have a [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7399.36s)]
*  best trend? Last year, I said the creator economy, which I think referred to all these kind of [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7406.719999999999s)]
*  creators creating new products and businesses beyond their content. This year, I think that [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7413.599999999999s)]
*  the trend that was again enabled and demonstrated through chat GPT is the narrator economy. I think [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7418.799999999999s)]
*  this is going to be a really important trend going forward. We'll talk about it in the prediction [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7423.599999999999s)]
*  episode. But I think the idea that people are and they're starting to experience this and using [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7426.64s)]
*  chat GPT and Dolly and other kind of generative AI tools is how much you can kind of narrate the [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7431.4400000000005s)]
*  product you want to see created and have it created for you on the fly. And I think that that's a [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7437.76s)]
*  really kind of powerful mind shift for people and frame shift for people. And I think it really [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7442.320000000001s)]
*  starts to change a lot of the way that people behave, entertain themselves, businesses operate, [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7447.200000000001s)]
*  and so on. So I'd call it the narrator economy. And I think it's really kind of starting to emerge. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7451.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay. Do you have a trend? Sax? [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7456.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would say best trend is the growing realization that the corporate media is failing, [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7458.16s)]
*  it does not tell the truth, it has an agenda. More and more people are opting out of it and [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7464.88s)]
*  going with independent media. I think, you know, what Elon mentioned, where we're going to start [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7468.72s)]
*  holding these corporate journalists the same standard on Twitter as regular citizens, [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7472.96s)]
*  they're outraged by that, but that's a huge step in the right direction. The fact of the matter is, [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7476.88s)]
*  is that the press or the media is the prism through which reality is refracted. And if [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7482.0s)]
*  it's not giving us an accurate representation of the world, we can't begin to solve our problems [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7487.12s)]
*  because we don't have accurate information. And I think more and more people are waking up from [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7492.24s)]
*  the matrix and realizing that we're living in this media controlled simulation. And again, [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7495.92s)]
*  I don't think we're going to make progress until this power that the media seems to have over our [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7502.0s)]
*  reality gets broken. Okay. Let's go for worst trend. My worst [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7507.76s)]
*  trend is the Fed trying to play catch up the Fed trying to play catch up. Sorry, buddy. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7511.68s)]
*  The Fed trying to play catch up is the worst trend for me oversteering into the crash. What [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7517.92s)]
*  do you got Chamath for the worst trend of 2020? The worst trend was the continued profligate [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7522.400000000001s)]
*  spending by the federal government. We have record deficits, record debt. And this year, [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7528.8s)]
*  we're ending the year by adding another $1.65 trillion of spending that nobody can seemingly [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7535.200000000001s)]
*  account for. It is truly the Christmas tree of Christmas trees in terms of bills. So we [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7540.72s)]
*  have not gotten religion yet around being measured in how we spend money. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7546.0s)]
*  Good one. Worst trend, Sax. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7551.04s)]
*  Last year, my worst trend was authoritarianism growing all over the world. And I think that's [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7552.88s)]
*  pretty decent prediction. This year's worst trend is the government colluding with big tech to [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7558.240000000001s)]
*  engage in censorship. This is how they're going to do the authoritarianism. We talked about it with [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7564.08s)]
*  Schellenberger and Elon, this whole series of revelations, known as the Twitter files. We can [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7568.4s)]
*  see this collusion, this cozy relationship between the censors at Twitter and big tech and the [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7573.44s)]
*  bureaucrats at the FBI and DHS and Pentagon. This is a really disturbing dystopian relationship, [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7578.879999999999s)]
*  as we talked about earlier. And I feel like we spent all this time talking about [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7586.08s)]
*  the authoritarianism in Russia and China. We seem to be obsessed with combating that and going to [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7591.92s)]
*  war with that. But we don't spend enough time talking about this growing authoritarianism at [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7597.52s)]
*  home. The media doesn't seem to want to report on the Twitter files at all. Let's focus on stopping [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7601.6s)]
*  authoritarianism here. Well said, Friedberg. What's your worst trend? [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7606.8s)]
*  My worst trend for 2022 is what I would call interest rate mania. And I think that this is [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7610.88s)]
*  the mania that we've been caught up in on this show that other people on our thread, people in [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7616.160000000001s)]
*  the business community and the investing community, where everyone's obsession with did the Fed act [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7621.76s)]
*  soon enough or late enough and that interest rates ultimately drive success or failure with [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7625.84s)]
*  building businesses and making good investments. And the truth is when interest rates go the wrong [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7630.0s)]
*  way, good investments can kind of strengthen their way, can make their way through those [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7635.2s)]
*  environments. Bad investments cannot. Good businesses can make their way through and bad [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7641.76s)]
*  investments cannot. And so I think our mania around the fact that interest rates and the Fed [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7645.76s)]
*  ultimately drove bad outcomes in businesses and investments is a flawed kind of assertion. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7650.4s)]
*  And we all want to kind of get back to the drunken days where, you know, a low interest rate [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7655.839999999999s)]
*  environment enables us all to be successful and wealthy. And I think that that's kind of changed. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7660.5599999999995s)]
*  So I think it's time for us to get away from the interest rate media and focus more on solid [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7664.32s)]
*  investing and solid business building. Okay, here we go. Lightning round. We've got two to go [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7668.4s)]
*  favorite media of 2022. For me, it was Top Gun House of the Dragon White Lotus too. But I'm [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7672.4s)]
*  going to pick my favorite here, something you may not have heard of the film Tar. I highly recommend [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7678.0s)]
*  it, but I did like those other three tremendously. What do you got, Sax, for your favorite media of [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7683.68s)]
*  2022? House of the Dragon, I guess I enjoyed quite a bit like you did. I'll give a shout out to my [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7687.84s)]
*  movie Dolly Land, which will be coming out next summer. If we're going to include podcast episodes, [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7693.04s)]
*  I would give a shout out to the unheard episode where Freddie Sayers interviews John Mearsheimer, [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7698.0s)]
*  the professor of international relations. He explains the origins of the Ukraine War and has [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7704.56s)]
*  some really pessimistic predictions about what might happen next. I suggest everyone watch it [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7709.52s)]
*  if they want to understand this conflict and where it may be going next year. Jamath, you have any [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7714.4800000000005s)]
*  favorite media for 2022 you want to share? I thought Yellowstone kicked ass. Absolutely incredible. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7719.360000000001s)]
*  There's a I think it's on Hulu. But there's a show with Steve Carell, a little short series called [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7726.88s)]
*  The Patient, which is about a serial killer that kidnaps his psychologist and locks him in his [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7732.56s)]
*  basement to try to help him prevent him killing more people. I thought it was really, really well [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7738.8s)]
*  done. Never have I ever the latest season, another just brilliant offering from Mindy Kaling. She's [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7745.04s)]
*  unbelievable. Those are those are probably the top ones. What do you got? Freeberg, any media? [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7752.72s)]
*  Yeah, I read a book this year that I really liked. It's called The Vital Question by a guy named [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7758.64s)]
*  Nick Lane, someone recommended it to me. It's he's a biochemist. And he kind of talks a little bit [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7763.76s)]
*  about the origin of life on Earth. It really ties into this idea that there are certain, call it [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7768.96s)]
*  principles of physics and statistics that make life predictive and predictable. But I think the [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7773.6s)]
*  way that he kind of walks through how a lot of things emerge in life and how life ultimately [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7779.76s)]
*  kind of developed on this planet are really well shown. So yeah, I give I give his book a shout out. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7787.04s)]
*  It was a really good read. So that book, The Vital Question is incredible. The other one that he [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7792.0s)]
*  wrote, which is called Life Ascending, those two books, you must read if you don't want to be a [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7796.64s)]
*  Luddite, in my opinion. All right. I will also also for those people who don't understand the [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7800.88s)]
*  difference between power and energy, you will learn what that is. Very good. I have two book [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7806.24s)]
*  recommendations putting the rabbit in the hat is Brian Cox, you may know him from secession. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7810.8s)]
*  He has a great book and he reads the audio book very enjoyable. I'm halfway through Quentin [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7816.320000000001s)]
*  Tarantino's cinema speculation and enjoying it very much. So actually, we'll enjoy it tremendously. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7820.64s)]
*  Okay. And now we do the Rudy Giuliani award for self emulation. This is for the person who poured [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7825.76s)]
*  lighter fluid and gasoline over themselves and lit themselves on fire for no apparent reason. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7833.04s)]
*  I go with Kevin O'Leary, who's secured a $15 million bag from FTX and then decided to try [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7836.88s)]
*  to defend it 18 ways to Sunday burning whatever reputation he had. Who do you have [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7842.48s)]
*  in your Rudy Giuliani award? This will be controversial for you guys. I'm going to go [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7849.5199999999995s)]
*  with Elon Musk. I don't think that Elon put himself in the position that he did [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7852.959999999999s)]
*  with bad intentions or without paying attention. I think he's taken on a role in buying and running [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7858.719999999999s)]
*  Twitter that is principled. And in his mind and many other people's minds, a really [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7865.2s)]
*  important role that someone needs to play. Unfortunately, I think his reputation has [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7872.4s)]
*  gotten really hurt because of that role. He's not making a lot of friends and he's [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7876.799999999999s)]
*  causing a lot of reputational damage. He obviously had a lot of good and important [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7884.639999999999s)]
*  things he was working on prior to taking on the additional burden of Twitter. And while many [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7888.719999999999s)]
*  people appreciate his doing it, I think that it's causing him a lot of reputational damage. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7893.04s)]
*  And so yeah, I don't mean to kind of be offensive in saying that, but [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7898.24s)]
*  I think he's gotten the biggest hit on reputation. It's certainly been a hard thing to do. It's [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7902.8s)]
*  certainly been a hard thing to do, Sacks. But you're saying self-immolation, [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7906.08s)]
*  Freeberg, because he took it on himself. He could have just- He took it on himself. Yeah, [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7908.88s)]
*  I'm not saying it's just dumb stupid stuff. It's one interpretation. Yeah, it's not like the Rudy [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7912.0s)]
*  Giuliani idiocy. I think he's taken on the burden of doing this and I think it's causing him a lot [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7915.92s)]
*  of reputational harm. Okay, it's an interpretation of the award. What do you got, Chamath? Sacks and [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7919.92s)]
*  Chamath? Well, I mean, if I were to interpret the award, I think the way it was originally [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7924.32s)]
*  intended, I think I got to give it to Herschel Walker this year, unfortunately. And I wish [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7929.28s)]
*  Republicans would stop winning this award. At least Herschel never gave any speeches next to [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7933.12s)]
*  a dildo shop, but nonetheless. I am so sorry. I'm so delighted, Sacks, that you've been so [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7938.16s)]
*  self-aware about the follies of the dying MAGA, the last throes of the MAGA nation. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7946.639999999999s)]
*  I want to find some Democrats to give this to. I want to give it to that brain dead senator [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7953.52s)]
*  from Pennsylvania. What's his name? Federman. Federman. Federman. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7958.72s)]
*  Thank you. I wanted to give it to Federman, but he won. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7962.0s)]
*  So I don't know what I'm supposed to do. It's like, no, listen, when a Republican [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7967.200000000001s)]
*  self-immolates like Rudy or Herschel or something like that, they get laughed out of town. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7972.080000000001s)]
*  And when the Democrat does it like a Federman, they just get elected. So I don't know what to say. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7977.040000000001s)]
*  All right, Chamath, you got any final words here? Go ahead. I mean, [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7981.76s)]
*  you got to end this episode. It's going to be the longest episode ever. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7984.320000000001s)]
*  Whew, I think it's poor producer Nick. Whoever signed the papers for the whole [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7987.280000000001s)]
*  search and seizure at Mar-a-Lago looks kind of like an idiot. So that was not politically astute. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7993.6s)]
*  Okay. You would say the FBI then. Okay. Poorly handled, perhaps? [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=7998.320000000001s)]
*  That's actually a great one, actually. If we're going to get serious for a second, [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8002.320000000001s)]
*  the combination of revelations, if we're going to look over this whole year. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8006.8s)]
*  Remember, Jason, when I basically spoke up at the time, they raided Mar-a-Lago [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8010.72s)]
*  and said that it was heavy-handed and unnecessary. And now you combine that. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8015.36s)]
*  I keep telling you guys for years, Donald Trump is an idiot savant minus the savant. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8018.96s)]
*  Why all of you guys just project all of this like insane, genius, evil level stuff? He's not capable [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8024.72s)]
*  of that. This is a simpleton who likes attention. He stole a bunch of souvenirs that he didn't [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8033.92s)]
*  read when he was in the White House, hasn't read now, kept in a box downstairs just to say he had [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8039.92s)]
*  them. That's exactly right. I was the one who championed the souvenir. I know he's a souvenir [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8044.72s)]
*  guy. You said he was selling secrets to the Saudis. No, I did not say that. I said my idea was [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8048.96s)]
*  souvenirs. You suggested it. You suggested it. I did not. I did not. You did. You did. You did. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8054.0s)]
*  Just because I read the news. Hold on. You were tweeting Jared Kushner [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8057.28s)]
*  and elaborate conspiracy theory. I'm saying that doesn't look good. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8060.32s)]
*  I know it's not a conspiracy theory when you do it. And, and guys, and this is the same person [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8063.2s)]
*  that basically in the, in the beginning of his presidential campaign in 2016 in front of Hillary [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8068.0s)]
*  Clinton said, absolutely. I bend the laws that you created the tax laws to my favor because I'm not [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8074.0s)]
*  stupid when she called him a tax Dodger. And it turns out after all these years, he was telling [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8081.44s)]
*  the truth. He basically once again, the show ends with Trump. He's been a great 2022. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8087.76s)]
*  No, no, but honestly, like, like, did we learn anything except that these tax laws are [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8094.0s)]
*  egregiously stupid. And the only people that are consistently guaranteed to make money in these [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8098.8s)]
*  tax laws are real estate investors. If you put these two things together, a real estate investor [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8103.84s)]
*  who happened to be very poor at his job, which Trump turned out to be packed billions of dollars [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8109.12s)]
*  of NOLs that he was able to use to wash his taxes for years and years. And by the way, and he was [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8115.2s)]
*  clearly proud of it. He was just goading the Democrats in not releasing them. They went [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8120.16s)]
*  through all this rigmarole. And what did we find out? He had huge NOLs. He had huge deductions and [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8124.32s)]
*  he paid no taxes. Is that shocking to any of us? It's like, it's like Chappelle said, he came out [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8129.68s)]
*  of the house, told everyone everything you think is going on inside that house is going on and [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8134.24s)]
*  went back and then he walked back inside the house. Yeah, it was pretty great. Chappelle got it. All [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8138.96s)]
*  right. Listen, for David Sacks, the Rain Man, for the Queen of Quinoa, [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8144.08s)]
*  Sultan of Science, David Friedberg, and the dictator himself, Chamath Palihapitiya, [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8151.6s)]
*  it has been an honor and a privilege to do this podcast with you gentlemen. This is [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8156.48s)]

*  We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8206.56s)]
*  like this like sexual tension that they just need to release that out. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8210.48s)]
*  What? You're the bee. What? You're the bee. We need to get merch. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0&t=8214.64s)]
