*  I've already gotten quite a bit of feedback from people that have been moved by the the the shorter version on the on the presentation [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=218.22s)]
*  Well, when you when you look back on your career unpack it for a minute [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=225.94s)]

*  You know you might change in terms of your career and being happy and finding your passion [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=233.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I do feel super fortunate that I was able to do, you know my my dream job for over two decades and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=239.45999999999998s)]

*  Disruptions and and to be able to place bets and all those things are super exciting [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=256.26s)]
*  Things I got right [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=262.14s)]
*  Studying history which is something I talk a lot about and we'll be talking about in the in the book like knowing who the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=263.78s)]
*  Patriarchs were of your industry and knowing what they thought I think is super powerful in any endeavor and then networking [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=270.86s)]
*  You know just like crazy [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=278.18s)]
*  Which I think is actually easier today. So those are a couple of the themes that we develop networking and studying history [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=279.97999999999996s)]
*  Specifically you and I have had many conversations about biographies. We both share a passion for those top biographies [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=287.21999999999997s)]
*  Not of business people but that had an impact on you and then I'll go around the horn top biographies [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=294.09999999999997s)]
*  That had an impact on you preferably ones that are in business, but if it is business, I guess it's okay one that actually led to me [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=298.9s)]
*  Developing this theme was was learning more about Danny Myers journey who is the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=306.46s)]
*  renowned restaurant owner in New York City and the founder of Shake Shack [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=312.94s)]
*  But he had a career where he was in sales [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=316.73999999999995s)]
*  He was about to go to law school and his I think his uncle told him what are you doing? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=319.38s)]
*  You know, you want to be a restaurant owner and he stopped that day took a job at 10k a month [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=324.62s)]
*  Our 10k a year he took like a wow 90% pay cut and [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=331.82s)]
*  Started studying and that gets into the history part [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=336.41999999999996s)]
*  But he just started studying and obviously the rest is history [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=339.26s)]
*  It goes a view that know about Danny my setting setting the table is the book. Yeah [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=342.53999999999996s)]
*  That is the book Union Square Cafe Gramercy Tavern amongst some of his great restaurants going around the horn here Friedberg [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=348.78s)]
*  You have a favorite biography you read or something that impacted you young in your career and then [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=355.53999999999996s)]
*  Do you feel like you figured it out? And what did you what would you change about the early part of your career? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=361.78s)]
*  So the same two questions, that's a three very loaded questions. I don't know how to [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=367.5s)]
*  Pick which one you want to answer that one. I will tell you when I was running my company in [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=371.53999999999996s)]
*  2011 climb around [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=377.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the climate corporation. I read the Walter Isaacson biography of Steve Jobs [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=379.26s)]
*  Yeah, and he actually profiled a number of jobs as management techniques [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=384.17999999999995s)]
*  My only operating role prior to that was working at Google. So that was the only management experience or exposure I had had [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=388.34000000000003s)]
*  and then reading about how jobs ran his management team it actually changed my behavior going into the office I I [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=395.74s)]
*  Took a very different approach and I saw the results almost immediately. What was the primary thing that impacted you? Well, first of all like [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=404.26000000000005s)]
*  Having the cadence and the and the directness [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=412.82000000000005s)]
*  With the team engaging the team fully and discourse immediately making decisions [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=416.26s)]
*  Getting everyone to commit moving forward very quickly. I was the first time CEO [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=421.14s)]
*  So I never had a good mentor and reading those segments of jobs as management style in his biography [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=425.56s)]
*  Was just a really great tool to add to my emerging toolkit on how to be a manager and how to be a CEO and how to [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=432.26s)]
*  Run a company that was big for me. I [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=438.34000000000003s)]
*  I [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=440.9s)]
*  Could rehash everything about early on in my life. I don't think that's yeah use of Walter [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=442.1s)]
*  But yeah, I six in this book on Elon coming out in a couple of weeks, which should be interesting [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=445.98s)]
*  I I sat for an interview with Walter for that one. So I'm interested to see how that turns out [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=451.22s)]
*  Yeah, I did too. I was asked to I didn't yeah, we were asked you didn't do it. No, I did it [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=456.54s)]
*  I did it. I you know, I don't I didn't ask to do it. I got asked, you know [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=462.28000000000003s)]
*  If I would write give some anecdotes, I think sacks also got asked if he would do some anecdotes [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=466.22s)]
*  So I think it's gonna be pretty good and Walter was hanging around [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=469.94s)]
*  Passages out on Twitter, right? Yeah, I mean he's such a good writer and just watching him [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=474.02s)]
*  You know David and I were at Twitter for a little bit and you know, just being he was hanging out [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=478.21999999999997s)]
*  He was like, you know in the corner of the room like participating in a lot of these meetings [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=482.7s)]
*  Yeah, so he was there basically during the whole transition. I [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=487.73999999999995s)]
*  Think that was gonna be the ending of the book is you know, he had to cut it off at some point [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=491.46s)]
*  But he was there for the first month of the transition [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=495.82s)]
*  Yeah, the Twitter takeover and for rocket launches and everything in between so he I mean watching his biography technique is [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=498.14s)]
*  It's pretty intense. I mean he spends a long time [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=505.06s)]
*  with the subjects and [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=508.09999999999997s)]
*  You know just taking notes and talking to everybody around him [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=509.94s)]
*  So he would you know peel off sacks or peel me off. Hey, could I ask you a question about this? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=513.02s)]
*  I asked you a question about this. What do you think of this? Well, Jay, speaking of books [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=517.3s)]
*  I'm in the rare position of needing your advice. Oh, okay [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=520.66s)]
*  Yeah [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=528.22s)]
*  Sort of a compliment. Okay, so Harper Collins. I'm gonna do a book about how to create run scale operate software companies [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=529.4200000000001s)]
*  Which will be an extension of the blog? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=538.1s)]
*  I've been writing for a couple of years which I haven't been active on mainly because I've been using that time for this pod [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=540.4200000000001s)]
*  But I was writing in a pretty good clip until we started doing all in pod [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=546.0200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I want to get back to putting that together [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=549.82s)]
*  Yes, and I could go chapter by chapter, you know, here's how you should think about marketing [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=552.3000000000001s)]
*  Here's how you should think about sales. Here's how you should think about finance metrics and so on [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=556.78s)]
*  But I'm not sure that's the best way to present the material [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=561.34s)]
*  so yeah, do I just write the book that I think it should be or [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=565.02s)]
*  Do I work with a publisher on what the business book should be and they kind of give me the guidance [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=568.98s)]
*  So it's a great question [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=574.94s)]
*  You are in a unique position where you know [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=577.82s)]
*  You're successful and you have an audience for the book and success for you is for you know [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=581.1s)]
*  Great founders to read the book and for it have impact as opposed to somebody who's an author who just wants to be published [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=585.22s)]
*  Right, so you have a different reason to do this. I [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=590.14s)]
*  Think you should write the book [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=593.14s)]
*  You should decide who you want the audience to be and what you want to get out of the book and you should forget about [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=595.26s)]
*  Publishers in the whole grand scheme of things [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=600.14s)]
*  Then when you write the treatment you write the first five chapters or so [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=602.3s)]
*  Then you can bring it to a select group of publishers. You can get an agent [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=605.9s)]
*  I can introduce it to two or three agents. There's you know, a top two or three in this field and [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=610.46s)]
*  I think what you should do is [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=615.3s)]
*  The business advice is out there right and the techniques are out there [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=617.86s)]
*  But what you have is you have war stories [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=621.78s)]
*  so the technique I used in my book angel was to [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=623.74s)]
*  You know talk about techniques and investing that I had learned from other folks including Bill Gurley and Michael Moritz or whatever [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=627.34s)]
*  But then I would give my anecdotes things I had experienced personally and what that does is it makes the examples let people really [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=633.1999999999999s)]
*  Get some narrative out of the book and so the lesson combined with the actual practical experience [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=641.34s)]
*  That's kind of the magic of these business books. I think [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=646.82s)]
*  Do you have a favorite? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=650.22s)]
*  Biography yourself sacks either business or non-business. I don't think I read a lot of business biographies [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=652.0600000000001s)]
*  We only know I read one business how-to book [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=658.5s)]
*  Back in the PayPal days, you know, I didn't have any real business education good to great. Do you remember what it was? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=663.6600000000001s)]
*  It was good to great. Yeah, I was the seminal book at the time. So I read this book and literally [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=669.66s)]
*  One chapter was on how you should stick to your core idea. And then the next chapter was about how you should be flexible [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=676.74s)]
*  Well, both of these ideas are right situation Lee. Yes, but so how do you decide? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=684.2199999999999s)]
*  So right I came away from the book thinking this isn't really gonna help me because it doesn't [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=689.06s)]
*  Give you what you really need which is what are the specific? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=693.6999999999999s)]
*  Situations in which you should apply a given principle. Mm-hmm [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=697.5s)]
*  Yes, and I kind of came away from like thinking that business self-help books just weren't that they're too theoretical and weren't that helpful [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=700.86s)]
*  Well, then this is where biographies really become helpful because you actually get to see why that, you know technique was deployed [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=708.54s)]
*  Brad, do you have any business miles that you know related to that about sex sex do not write a how-to book? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=714.62s)]

*  He can't quit his job and [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=902.38s)]
*  Back in the day they used to sell your hardcover rights and your paperback rights separately if your hardcover went [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=904.38s)]
*  Well, then you would do a paperback and go mass market [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=909.9799999999999s)]
*  He gets a call they sold the rights to the mass market book [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=914.02s)]
*  $400,000 the paperback [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=917.66s)]
*  This agent gets on the phone and says it's $40,000 and he thinks he hears 40,000. He says well $40,000. That's incredible [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=919.66s)]

*  He can't believe it and that was basically the story of how Stephen King [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=937.02s)]
*  But it'd be great great to listen to prior to writing a book. He's [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=940.86s)]
*  It's super amazing though most people don't know this fact but King wrote the novella that became Shawshank [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=944.06s)]

*  You have to jump in a cold plunge [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1083.3400000000001s)]
*  Because now i've done it four times out of the last like i'm doing it every other day and they're right [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1085.3400000000001s)]
*  I feel like a superhero after I do this anybody doing cold plunge here besides me and shaman [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1090.06s)]
*  Nobody [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1096.14s)]
*  Occasionally, I mean I was in mexico a few weeks ago [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1097.18s)]
*  And they had this this this cold plunge thing and I we did it every day that we were there at the hotel [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1100.54s)]
*  But then we came back [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1105.82s)]
*  Well, it's you get this endorphin rush rush afterwards. It's incredible [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1107.4199999999998s)]
*  And then afterwards now when I go to the gym [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1111.5s)]
*  I only do like a 10 minute ice cold shower afterwards like it's critical to like and it feels amazing [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1113.82s)]
*  You feel like so relaxed after you I did I did six I did five or six minutes at 58 degrees [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1118.3s)]
*  I've been lowering it two degrees a day, but the first day I did it at 43 or 44 [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1123.98s)]
*  For like 45 seconds and my body started shaking. I got hypothermia instantly bill. You've done it. You've done this nonsense occasionally [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1128.5400000000002s)]
*  I'm still not convinced. There's any medical [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1135.3400000000001s)]
*  But [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1139.42s)]
*  It's very trendy [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1143.42s)]
*  I haven't [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1147.5800000000002s)]
*  And we literally what my last week has been failure [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1158.3000000000002s)]
*  You just take your take your bike into the cold plunge and then you ride it into the aburad sada [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1162.5400000000002s)]
*  And then you go play pickleball. Yeah, okay, and you're wondering why everybody hates us. Um [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1167.9s)]
*  lifestyles of the abhorrent [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1173.8200000000002s)]
*  1% [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1177.18s)]
*  All right. Listen by the way a couple other rentals that are kurosawa films are worth watching actually he did [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1178.38s)]
*  He did versions of shakespeare, which I think is really interesting [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1184.46s)]
*  Absolutely. So kurosawa took on shakespeare and then hollywood kind of adapted kurosawa [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1187.56s)]
*  But a couple of really good ones thrown a blood was kurosawa's adaptation of mcbeth [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1192.22s)]
*  And then rand was his adaptation of king lear two of my favorites worth checking out hidden fortress [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1197.74s)]
*  Also great in fortress became the basis for star wars. It was a big influence [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1203.58s)]
*  Yeah, the r2d2 and c3p characters c3po characters who are like sort of telling the story [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1208.22s)]
*  Are in the hidden fortress. You can see the direct descendants here. But for me the genre I love for kurosawa is his [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1214.62s)]
*  film the wa era stray dog [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1220.86s)]
*  high and low I mean these are [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1223.34s)]
*  Exceptional films and high and low I wanted to remake when I was thinking about being a film director and it turns out [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1225.8s)]
*  Spielberg owns the rights [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1230.84s)]
*  High and low incredible story, but we digress here. Let's get to the doc. You just one one last anecdote [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1232.94s)]
*  I know the tv show breaking bad [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1239.58s)]
*  He was inspired by ikiru the kurosawa film about a guy who finds out he's gonna die and when he finds out [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1241.6599999999999s)]
*  He's gonna die suddenly. He becomes one of my true self like was this true like nature comes out [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1247.26s)]
*  so an incredibly poignant film [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1252.6999999999998s)]
*  that obviously inspired the the extraordinary, uh tv show breaking bad, yeah, kuro is um [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1255.26s)]
*  means to live in japanese and this is the story of somebody who has [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1262.1399999999999s)]
*  Basically lived a modest amid it's somebody who lived a midlife [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1266.3s)]
*  But then at the end decides he wants to do something meaningful with his little pittance of money and [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1269.5s)]
*  to make an impact on the world and so he decides he's going to take a [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1274.8600000000001s)]
*  a parking lot that's disgusting and filled with garbage and make it into a [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1278.14s)]
*  kids playground [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1282.7s)]
*  So people can enjoy their life it is [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1284.46s)]
*  And it's also it's um to shiromafune as an old man [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1286.8600000000001s)]
*  So in a way this parallels their careers and trying to do something [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1291.5s)]
*  important [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1296.28s)]
*  There's another one I live in fear [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1298.1399999999999s)]
*  so those two to live and I live in fear about aging and getting all the genre if you don't know kuro [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1299.4199999999998s)]
*  kurosawa, you know just [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1304.3s)]
*  You're going to need to be a little patient because it doesn't have a thousand cuts per minute like modern films [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1306.62s)]
*  It's not the transformers or a marvel film, but it's well worth it if you can get your adhd under control [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1311.4199999999998s)]
*  I would start with the samurai movies [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1317.26s)]
*  Samurai was super excessive. Yeah, seven samurai thrown to blood and ran [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1319.34s)]
*  Yeah, you go there and then there's I mean if you want to go super intellectual roshamon [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1324.46s)]
*  Which is about [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1329.5s)]
*  Truth every people's different perspective every film every film theory class starts with roshamor. Yeah, so there's your uh, usc [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1331.5s)]
*  film school [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1339.02s)]
*  divergence [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1340.7s)]
*  Save a hundred grand. Okay [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1341.9s)]
*  We'll see you all at uca. Yeah. Okay vc market update karta has released a series a funding map [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1345.02s)]
*  Covering the first half of 2023 but the date is what's interesting [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1352.14s)]
*  They covered and karta basically manages cap tables and stuff like that for folks original company was e shares. I think [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1355.66s)]
*  This is a funding map which just shows like how much money was raised [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1362.78s)]
*  Nothing really too consequential in there. But what's really interesting is the data on [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1366.22s)]
*  Series a rounds series a rounds are typically the rounds when a benchmark or sequoia a craft come in [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1371.98s)]
*  and you know join the board and put in a [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1378.46s)]
*  Significant check before that you have angels [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1381.42s)]
*  And seed investors and after that you have growth funds, but the series a is considered like a seminal moment in the history of a startup [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1384.54s)]
*  median round [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1390.8600000000001s)]
*  Is now seven million raised that's down [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1392.38s)]
*  26% year over year [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1395.08s)]
*  And this is all data from the first half of the year [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1397.3400000000001s)]
*  It's the first half of 2023 versus 2022 which was a really crummy year [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1400.46s)]
*  We're down from the crummy year 26 on the dollars raised seven million [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1404.8600000000001s)]
*  And the the pre money valuation 40 million down 17 percent. So last year it was 11 million raised on 48 [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1409.4199999999998s)]
*  I don't have the [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1416.4599999999998s)]
*  2021 data here, but it would be even more so just right off the bat [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1418.1999999999998s)]
*  Reactions, I'll start you bill girly to what we're seeing in this series a space is a return to normalcy. I mean the series a's [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1424.12s)]
*  Back in the you know, uber days and airbnb days were what five ten million bucks on a 30 million [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1431.9799999999998s)]
*  So this is return to normalcy. Yeah, I don't I don't think you've gone quite back to that line, right? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1438.86s)]
*  and so I think there's still a significant amount of competition at that level and [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1444.6999999999998s)]
*  The fact that it's off a little bit is is noteworthy [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1451.4199999999998s)]
*  But it's not like off 50 percent, right? I think that market remains competitive [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1454.62s)]
*  I think there's a number of great people out there investing at that level and and of course [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1459.82s)]
*  the ai deals [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1464.9399999999998s)]
*  Like one thing that might be interesting is if you pulled the ai deals out, I bet those numbers would be [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1466.78s)]
*  More akin to what they were two or three years ago because those are being done at 200 [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1472.46s)]
*  Is the reason you went to angel investing or seed investing? Let's call it because it's so [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1477.18s)]
*  crowded and competitive at the series a level and [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1482.46s)]
*  What seed investing is now? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1485.82s)]
*  Is what series a investing was for the 20 years of your career? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1488.62s)]
*  No [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1492.7s)]
*  I do okay [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1494.54s)]
*  I think if I were practicing [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1496.46s)]
*  Institutionally, I would I would stay at the series a level and take board seats and try and get as much ownership as possible [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1499.32s)]
*  Which is the been the benchmark strategy? I I um [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1505.5s)]
*  This is more of a hobby thing for me. Got it, and I don't want board seats anymore [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1509.42s)]
*  But it's super super crowded at series a still to this day. Yeah, I said it was competitive [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1515.58s)]
*  I don't know that it's super crowded. I think a lot of people [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1521.18s)]
*  Realize that if you can get two and a half or three percent management fee investing 300 million dollars at a pop [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1525.0s)]
*  That's an easier lifestyle than actually taking board seats and doing work [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1532.3s)]
*  And so I think a lot of money and activity got pulled into the late stage market nearly every firm [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1536.78s)]
*  Started doing that and and once the once the center of gravity goes there in a firm, you know [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1543.26s)]
*  And you're investing 200 million a clip [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1549.58s)]
*  Can you imagine the monday meetings like who's paying attention to the person that's putting five million out at a time? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1552.6999999999998s)]
*  Like it'd be hard. It's like going to playing high stakes cards and then you get invited to you're playing [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1558.54s)]
*  200-400-200 and you go to five ten games [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1564.62s)]
*  It's like it's it's if there's a team and who's paying attention to the person playing in the little game [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1567.34s)]
*  And so I actually think the number of people that practice at that level has actually gone down [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1571.6599999999999s)]
*  Huh, but that doesn't mean you know the the business since I got in [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1577.8200000000002s)]
*  Only got more competitive and so there's still [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1582.46s)]
*  Enough and and and the other thing is the founders have learned how to play [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1585.66s)]
*  However, if there's 10 people doing it, they know how to play them off of one another. They're very skilled at it [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1591.26s)]
*  Yeah [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1596.7s)]
*  That's a that's a weird thing that happened is like the playbook [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1597.5800000000002s)]
*  Because of podcasts because of blog posts. I mean just how to [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1601.1000000000001s)]
*  How to run a company and then you know how to you know negotiate with vcs. It's all been unpacked [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1605.9s)]
*  Sax what are you seeing? Uh, you're a series a investor you compete with [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1612.54s)]
*  The sequoias the benchmarks, uh heads up for these series a's [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1616.46s)]
*  What are you seeing in the series a and what do you take from this data being down 26 percent year over year? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1620.22s)]
*  Which probably actually means probably 50 down from the peak [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1624.54s)]
*  Uh, what are your thoughts? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1627.66s)]
*  Well, yeah the the venture capital market peaked in q4 of 2021 [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1629.5s)]
*  In terms of both valuations and the amount of money that was being deployed and it kept going down [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1634.72s)]
*  throughout all of 2022 and I think it bottomed out in q1 [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1640.48s)]
*  of [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1645.92s)]
*  2023 basically in the last several months and I think now [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1646.8600000000001s)]
*  The pace of deployment has sort of stabilized [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1650.72s)]
*  And it's kind of stabilized at a pre-pandemic level [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1654.16s)]
*  So, you know maybe a 2019 level now, I think [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1658.8000000000002s)]
*  That probably massed some big differences by round [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1662.08s)]
*  so like you're saying [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1665.28s)]
*  Series a rounds are more competitive. There's relatively more action there. I think the late stage rounds [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1667.04s)]
*  Brad can speak to this the capital there has dried up. I think considerably more [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1672.48s)]
*  And those rounds are much harder to get [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1676.96s)]
*  And the reason I think is because that when you have more operating history [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1679.52s)]
*  Then it's harder to raise around based on narrative [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1683.92s)]
*  Whereas when you're at a very early stage you can basically just raise money based on a dream and a story [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1687.44s)]
*  The way I frame it to people is when i'm part of this is my fault because i'm training people in our accelerators and pre-accelerators [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1693.44s)]
*  I tell them you're either selling promise or performance [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1699.44s)]
*  And you know once you start having customers and numbers and retention [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1702.0s)]
*  You know someone like sax is going to be like give me the data and they're going to look at churn and say yeah [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1706.16s)]
*  This business has too much churn. It's a leaky bucket. Whatever. Well when you're selling promise [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1709.68s)]
*  It's a lot easier than selling performance. I'll tell you guys the ceo [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1713.68s)]
*  That is a well-known [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1717.04s)]
*  ceo public company now [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1718.64s)]
*  He told me and I think girly I think you guys were investors [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1721.28s)]
*  Um, he said as soon as we started having revenue [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1724.96s)]
*  Our valuation felt like it went down as soon as we started making profit our valuation went down because at that point you're you know, you're judged on [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1728.56s)]
*  the quality [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1736.32s)]
*  of that stage of the business whereas before [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1737.52s)]
*  You could paint a picture with a thousand words about the different paths you might walk and everyone [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1740.64s)]
*  Wants to believe the optimistic path will be walked and so you can boost your valuation boost investor interest [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1745.52s)]
*  But once those numbers start to come through it [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1751.1200000000001s)]
*  It really changes the investor criteria for how they assess the value of the business [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1752.64s)]
*  So a lot of people will state if they have a product launch telling me they'll they'll tell you to raise money [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1756.4s)]
*  Before you launch yes, I'll the promise of that launch. Yes old saying it's better to raise on the sizzle than on the steak [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1763.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, unless the steak is pretty high grade. Yeah, obviously if the steak is great then [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1770.24s)]
*  Yes, that's the best time to take that risk off the table. Yeah, but but just to recap I think where we are [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1775.2s)]
*  I think the venture capital markets have stabilized for funding new companies [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1782.16s)]
*  I think there's a mania going on with ai both in terms of the size of these rounds and the valuations. It's like [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1786.24s)]
*  2021 for a lot of ai companies. We're not [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1791.82s)]
*  Participating in that craziness. We are doing some c checks. I would say and early stage ai companies were kind of [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1795.02s)]
*  Calibrating the size of the check with [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1800.8600000000001s)]
*  The stage and amount of risk and I think that's appropriate [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1803.76s)]
*  So you are going pre-series a seed putting in that's a 500k 1 million dollar check seed is what makes the most sense [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1806.9599999999998s)]
*  I think for ai [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1813.6s)]
*  startups because [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1815.4399999999998s)]
*  If you wait for a later round then they're not being priced based on fundamentals at all. Yeah [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1817.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so what check size is that 500k million? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1823.6s)]
*  We just did we did one of a of four million dollar check where he led kind of a bigger seed round [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1826.1599999999999s)]
*  Got it fantastic. I love that. Those are called seed rounds today [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1831.2s)]
*  I mean used to be three to five million ways your series a but yeah, sure seed round three to five [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1834.88s)]
*  I still don't understand the term pre-seed so just to finish the thought I think where we're at and you know [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1839.52s)]
*  Brad can can chime in on this is I think the venture capital market has stabilized for [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1843.84s)]
*  New companies new fundraising. However, I think there's going to be a one to two year period of distress [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1848.8s)]
*  For all these companies that raised in the peak. Yep, 2020 2021 and are now [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1854.08s)]
*  Running out of money and they don't have enough revenue. They're not growing fast enough [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1859.3600000000001s)]
*  And or their burn is too high and all those companies are going to be facing down rounds or restructurings [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1863.28s)]
*  Or they're not going to be able to raise well people are also marking their books now [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1869.76s)]
*  We're starting to see the marking of the books down [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1873.28s)]
*  So we're going to have probably a one to two year period of distress for all those bubble companies while [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1876.32s)]
*  We have a little bit of a resurgence for new companies. I've got another [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1882.4s)]
*  Topic i'm going to go to here related but braddage wanted to let you chime in on the late stage there because you operate in [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1887.36s)]
*  the bc syringe, yeah, I think uh, and this is related to the topic I suspect we're going to transition to but [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1892.32s)]
*  Listen there is a lot of activity in venture today [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1899.6s)]
*  right and [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1902.8s)]
*  We're very reflective to the stock market people were really scared in q3 and q4 of 2022 [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1904.0s)]
*  Started in 2021 but cute [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1910.24s)]
*  2022 was scary to people [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1912.94s)]
*  Because public market valuations for growth companies were down over 50% [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1914.72s)]
*  So we really saw, you know ipo markets venture all all all start to slow down [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1918.56s)]
*  Coming out of that. We've seen, you know stock market within, you know, 10 of all-time highs [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1924.56s)]
*  We see, you know this wave of ai occurring what I would tell you is [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1930.72s)]
*  Under 500 million maybe under 600 million right series b [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1935.28s)]
*  And c rounds are as hot as i've ever seen them in data infrastructure and ai and software, etc [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1940.56s)]
*  So there is a lot of competition there the later stage stuff, which as you know, I call quasi public [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1947.68s)]
*  So if a company is over a billion dollars right now you're you're very reflective relative to what's happening in the public markets [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1953.2s)]
*  We're starting to see activity. I just read wiz raised more money. It's got 200 million dollar arr raised at 10 billion [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1960.72s)]
*  So those markets are definitely times revenue [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1967.52s)]
*  Yeah, we did not participate [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1970.72s)]
*  Um, but 50 times revenue [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1972.8s)]
*  You know, so there is definitely activity. I know a deal [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1975.68s)]
*  We got called on yesterday raising two and a half billion at a hundred billion. There is a lot of activity. However [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1978.3999999999999s)]
*  sax is right [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1984.8s)]
*  There is you know, remember we had a thousand unicorns at the end of 2021 [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1986.8799999999999s)]
*  And i've said 100% of those are going to do a down round [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1991.46s)]
*  And we're still in the early stages of that reset to occur [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1994.74s)]
*  There was some you know [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=1999.06s)]
*  There's a report out this week that lots of people comment on twitter where public markets were down 50% [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2000.18s)]
*  And private marks were down. I don't know 5 to 10 percent like that will all normalize [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2004.9s)]
*  It's all going to be down, you know the same so that's the only place I don't see activity under [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2010.1s)]
*  Performant companies that were valued over a billion dollars [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2015.28s)]
*  Those are dead on arrival until you get to a market clearing price and we're not there yet [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2018.42s)]
*  Okay. So the other big issue here is a lot of money was raised by vcs [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2023.6200000000001s)]
*  Oh, you know commonly known as dry powder in the industry [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2029.46s)]
*  But there are some misconceptions about this dry powder people are saying. Oh my god [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2032.66s)]
*  All this money is going to come flowing [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2036.42s)]
*  Into the ecosystem kumbaya. It's going to be the roaring 20s again [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2038.66s)]
*  However, uh bill you did a little tweet storm what people don't realize is when we refer to dry powder at vc firms [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2044.02s)]
*  The vcs do not have that [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2052.26s)]
*  250 billion dollars or whatever it is quarter trillion dollars sitting in their bank accounts [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2054.96s)]
*  That money is sitting in another person's bank account lps [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2059.2200000000003s)]
*  harvard's endowment calper sovereign wealth funds, etc. It has not been drawn down by the vcs yet, so [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2063.06s)]
*  Bill why is this an important fact for people to understand and what are the dynamics that lps? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2070.98s)]
*  Are dealing with yeah, and there's a ton of dynamics between [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2077.86s)]
*  The gps at the venture capitalist and the lps at those endowments that brad brad started to hit on one of those [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2081.62s)]
*  Which is the marks aren't in the right place [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2088.58s)]
*  And and so so the thing you just explained critical jason, which is you don't actually have the money [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2091.14s)]
*  There's no there's no venture firm sitting around [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2097.3s)]
*  with [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2100.42s)]
*  You know all the money that they've got committed to their fund in a bank account [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2101.3s)]
*  That's just why not why does that not actually occur because people would say oh you raised a billion from these folks [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2105.62s)]
*  They gave you the billion right? Why do you not take it down one of the the brilliant? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2111.22s)]
*  Realities of the way that a lp agreement works with a venture fund is they're not on the irr [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2116.8s)]
*  Clock until they actually pull the money down [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2122.18s)]
*  So they explain what that means they charge fees based on the total committed amount [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2124.34s)]
*  But they don't actually draw the money down and get gauged on the performance of their investment until they need it [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2129.1400000000003s)]
*  And so a classic venture firm will do five six drawdowns over a 10 year period of a fund [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2135.38s)]
*  And so they don't act they literally don't have the money [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2142.6600000000003s)]
*  a couple of other things worth noting so and some of that I didn't put in the tweet, but [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2145.94s)]
*  The marks aren't right and [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2150.34s)]
*  Everyone kind of quietly knows that the marks aren't right, but there's actually no incentive to get the marks, right? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2152.5800000000004s)]
*  Explain what a mark is to folks so private companies have an evaluation that's assessed [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2158.9s)]
*  Either by the gp themselves in most cases, which is a bit of a conflict of interest [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2164.98s)]
*  Sometimes by your auditor e and wire whoever's auditing your venture fund [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2170.34s)]
*  But of course the techniques they have for assessing valuation are extremely crude [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2174.7400000000002s)]
*  Because they're not market-based. They're just they're not public companies. Yeah, and so there's actually not a way to know they have extremely complicated cap tables [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2180.5800000000004s)]
*  the other thing is [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2190.1000000000004s)]
*  many lps [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2192.34s)]
*  are actually [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2194.1800000000003s)]
*  bonus on the paper mark [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2195.44s)]
*  And this is something that a lot of people don't realize and so they don't have an incentive [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2198.34s)]
*  To dial around to the gps and say get your marks, right? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2203.94s)]
*  Because it's actually going to reflect poorly on them if they were to roll those up [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2207.2200000000003s)]
*  Are both of the lp and the gp are in a dance there. Hey, we know that stripe is not worth 100 billion right now [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2211.7000000000003s)]
*  It's worth 50 billion [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2217.86s)]
*  But if you mark it down, I don't get my bonus. I'm the person who's giving you money for your next fund [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2219.3s)]
*  And so when we're assessing hey, how much are we going to give you for your next fund? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2224.98s)]
*  We're going to look at the performance of previous funds [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2228.1s)]
*  As an indicator back on what you just said I agree with what you just said except [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2230.82s)]
*  No one has the explicit conversation [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2235.94s)]
*  No, it's an emergent. It's an emergent behavior. It's emergent the dynamic system [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2238.5s)]
*  Yeah, show me an incentive. I'll show you an outcome kind of situation [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2243.7000000000003s)]
*  But there's no i've never heard of an lp like brow being gps to get their marks, right? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2246.34s)]
*  Like especially on the downside never heard of that ever those marks can be done by an audit [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2251.5400000000004s)]
*  Like you said they could be done by around a financing [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2256.82s)]
*  And sometimes there's a secondary market weird secondary market secondary market can do it [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2260.5s)]
*  And sometimes lps have this weird situation where different venture firms are marketing companies at radically different prices [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2265.54s)]
*  Oh, which creates some interesting dynamics [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2272.7400000000002s)]
*  Okay, so I did this series I did the seed round of stripe where i'm y combinator and I say, you know what? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2275.38s)]
*  50 billion is fine. We're going to market at 50 billion because we we invested at 2 million in stripe [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2280.9s)]
*  But then whoever did the you know series g or whatever it's up to [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2286.02s)]
*  We did the hundred billion dollar mark is like, yeah, we'll mark it down to 90 [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2290.2599999999998s)]
*  But you know somebody calpers or harvard has two has the same share class in two different funds at two different prices [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2293.62s)]
*  So then you could really triangulate on reality, huh? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2301.54s)]
*  Another dynamic that uh that makes it powdered less less dry [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2304.8199999999997s)]
*  That that I didn't mention in the tweet storm. Imagine you're on your first or second venture fund [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2309.38s)]
*  Or imagine you're a fund that used to just have a one fund, but they've expanded to four funds [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2315.2200000000003s)]
*  Okay now [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2321.3s)]
*  Imagine you don't have a lot of liquidity proof points on those funds [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2323.2200000000003s)]
*  Do you really want to run out of money and go test whether or not you can raise your third fund or your second fund? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2327.38s)]
*  Or do you kind of want to wait and see if you can develop some track records so that because you may be facing [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2335.06s)]
*  The imminent death of your firm if you run out too quickly and and go back to market and there is no market [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2342.26s)]
*  So I have a hundred million dollar fund. It's my third fund [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2348.98s)]
*  Okay, what pace am I going to do this? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2352.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm going to do it in 24 months or 18 months like maniacs were doing during the peak [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2354.5s)]
*  Or am I going to take a 36 month approach a more traditional three-year deployment if I even if I take a 40 month deployment [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2358.58s)]
*  Hey, I got time to work out all these issues in the previous portfolio sacks. You've heard this sort of dynamic [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2364.34s)]
*  What are your thoughts on the dry powder issue you yourself have a lot of dry powder I understand so [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2370.02s)]
*  How do you think about it? We do have a lot of dry powder and we're going really slow [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2375.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, there's no feeling that we have to rush out and deploy this capital [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2378.26s)]
*  and one of the things that's interesting about the period we've been in that's been surprising to me is that our [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2383.14s)]
*  Metrics actually haven't changed [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2389.14s)]
*  I mean the the things that we're looking for in a software company haven't really changed [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2390.5s)]
*  We look for a certain amount of arr certain growth rates certain amount of net dollar retention [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2394.1s)]
*  Certain cac a certain capital efficiency that bar hasn't changed for us [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2398.82s)]
*  But the number of companies meeting that bar has gone down considerably [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2403.1400000000003s)]
*  Because they have headwinds because customers are in austerity measures or companies are going out of business and saying hey [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2406.58s)]
*  Let me consolidate my sass tools enterprise buyers are sharpening their pencils. They are trying to consolidate vendors [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2411.78s)]
*  There's a lot of headwinds in the buying cycle right now. Yeah, and [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2417.46s)]
*  It's a little bit like I don't know if you remember in the dot-com crash 20 something years ago [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2422.02s)]
*  Oh, I remember it. Yeah, so back in 99 2000 [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2426.9s)]
*  the conventional wisdom [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2431.06s)]
*  was that the company you wanted to be in was yahoo because [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2432.9s)]
*  Yahoo was profitable and when all these startups went out of business [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2436.42s)]
*  Yahoo would be the way that you could own a piece of the future of the internet [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2440.58s)]
*  But you wouldn't have to take all the startup risk and then it turned out that all of yahoo's revenues went away [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2444.34s)]
*  Because their revenues were coming from banner advertisements bought [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2450.02s)]
*  By startups which were funded by vc dollars. So when you had the whole dot-com crash yahoo's business dried up [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2453.7799999999997s)]
*  Yep, so then yahoo lost whatever it was out. It turned out a lot of people weren't wearing swim trunks [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2460.1s)]
*  It was yeah, so so yahoo's business was actually highly correlated with startup funding [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2465.46s)]
*  and I think there's been an aspect of that with a lot of these companies where [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2470.9s)]
*  You would think that they're pretty insulated from the business cycle [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2476.02s)]
*  Even like especially the enterprise software companies, there's a lot of [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2481.8599999999997s)]
*  Software companies that were selling to other startups. That was pretty obvious [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2485.94s)]
*  They're going to be impacted but even the ones selling to enterprise companies have been affected in subtle ways [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2488.42s)]
*  And there just aren't that many startups right now hitting [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2493.8599999999997s)]
*  That same bar that they were hitting just a couple years ago freeburg your thoughts on [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2498.18s)]
*  this lp gp dynamics and dry pattern [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2503.06s)]
*  I mean I think I mean one aspect on the same front of uh vcs [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2507.06s)]
*  Being somewhat reticent to deploy more capital [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2515.3s)]
*  it's [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2519.14s)]
*  Flowing through to the lp space and girly can probably pine on this sac can probably pine on this too [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2519.94s)]
*  But and all of you guys obviously could but it's been [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2525.3s)]
*  Apparent in the last year [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2530.1s)]
*  Apparent in the last year that lps are wondering what do they have? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2532.5s)]
*  What are these portfolios ultimately really going to be worth? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2538.1s)]
*  What's the actual cash distributions and I think there's these new rules right girly where you got to distribute five percent? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2540.18s)]
*  Of your assets each year to the institution that you're meant to be able to expand this your endowment [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2545.7799999999997s)]
*  You're obligated [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2551.2999999999997s)]
*  To not just grow your endowment both either from the board of the like the edamame board of trustees of university [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2552.9s)]
*  Or I think there was a tax [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2559.7799999999997s)]
*  Provision put in that if you're not distributing five percent, then you're exposed to tax on the returns [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2562.42s)]
*  And so there's a there's a unquestionable [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2568.9s)]
*  Potential issue with lps around their own liquidity [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2573.94s)]
*  So they've all followed the dave swinson model where they've all got 50 percent or even more in illiquid assets [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2577.46s)]
*  You move into a cyclical decline [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2585.54s)]
*  Where the number of ipos and liquidity events both for bcs and pe remember pe is way better than bcs [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2588.26s)]
*  Private equity aren't coming and then the drawdowns keep coming and so you have to meet the drawdowns [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2595.38s)]
*  You're not getting any liquidity [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2602.5s)]
*  your [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2604.5800000000004s)]
*  Constituent needs five percent [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2605.6800000000003s)]
*  Liquidity and now you have a cash crunch now you you have a cash crunch as an lp [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2607.86s)]
*  And I think gps are aware of this issue. So, you know [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2612.9s)]
*  Do you want to provoke that or not? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2616.9s)]
*  Right, so maybe you run quick you run early or you run late. You don't want to be in the middle [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2619.14s)]
*  I'll just say like anecdotally it it seems [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2624.5s)]
*  Lps are more reticent. I've heard several folks talk about [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2629.54s)]
*  How they're reducing commitments by 50 percent two-thirds or in some cases 100 percent [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2633.7000000000003s)]
*  Particularly after the the mad rush for capital over the last couple of years or capital commitments [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2639.7000000000003s)]
*  I would say for the last couple of years [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2644.1s)]
*  and so [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2646.18s)]
*  The downstream effect of that ultimately as the current funds get deployed [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2647.2999999999997s)]
*  there are fewer new funds and less new capital being committed from these lps into new funds and [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2652.58s)]
*  You know fast forward two or three years [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2658.8199999999997s)]
*  And there's going to be less capital available. And so it keeps the bar high [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2661.2999999999997s)]
*  Uh, this is a while this is you know, and so the bar I think is only going to get higher over the next couple of years [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2664.98s)]
*  As that capital cycle moves its way through the system [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2670.8199999999997s)]
*  It's probably worth [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2674.18s)]
*  Explaining what freeberg was talking about in terms of a commitment. So you may have a let's just say university x [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2675.7799999999997s)]
*  Has committed 25 million to funds three through five for a venture fund [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2683.54s)]
*  z [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2690.58s)]
*  And now they're saying [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2691.62s)]
*  In the next fund we're going to be at 10 [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2693.7s)]
*  Instead of 25 when they say they're making that commitment that capital gets deployed by the venture investor [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2695.94s)]
*  Over the next on average call it five years [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2702.42s)]
*  So the reduction in a commitment this year means that there's less capital to invest [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2705.7000000000003s)]
*  Over the next three to five years and so that gets played out as we fast forward [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2711.3s)]
*  We're you know, we're still sitting on funds from the last couple of years as those funds get invested [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2715.46s)]
*  The new funds are going to be smaller [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2720.82s)]
*  There's going to be fewer of them which and that's when the market gets much tighter is in the next couple years [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2722.5s)]
*  You know brad, you're right. Look, this seems like the greatest setup ever [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2726.6600000000003s)]
*  Feels like the setup last year buying equities when everybody was scared [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2730.6600000000003s)]
*  If everybody is tightening their belts if vc funds are not going to deploy this feels like the time to be deploying [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2734.5s)]
*  So maybe you could talk a little bit about this austerity [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2740.82s)]
*  measures coming or [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2743.86s)]
*  Just belt tightening or some people may be getting out of the venture business who shouldn't have been in it to begin with [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2745.5400000000004s)]
*  All of this seems like a great setup for more discipline and more disciplined founders if the vcs have to be disciplined [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2751.3s)]
*  Doesn't that trickle down to the portfolio companies 100% but and while this might happen [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2757.22s)]
*  While this might happen i'm going to take the other side. I don't think that's what the lived experiences [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2764.58s)]
*  Of most vcs in silicon valley today on series a series b series c is certainly not in the area [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2769.4599999999996s)]
*  We're competing we're seeing four or five six hundred million dollar deals get done on zero revenue two three million dollars in revenue [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2775.14s)]
*  And so let me just throw out perhaps an alternative view as to why this might look a little different [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2783.3s)]
*  than the world [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2788.82s)]
*  Of austerity that we saw in 2002 2003 2009 10 and 11 [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2790.5s)]
*  The first is right the stock market is near an all-time high and we know that you know [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2795.06s)]
*  The venture markets are reflective to the stock market. We talked about that [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2799.94s)]
*  The second reason which I think is interesting is most firms on average are a lot bigger [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2803.46s)]
*  Okay, that creates two issues [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2808.26s)]
*  We have a situation where younger partners and principals who all did deals that were overvalued over the last few years [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2810.58s)]
*  They want to put some points on the board in a repriced deal because they have to have some winners [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2817.62s)]
*  So you have this principal agent problem [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2822.34s)]
*  The people who used to check them were the senior partners, right the the investment committee [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2824.98s)]
*  But now they have a lot of mouths to feed. So when you put money to work you pull down more fee [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2830.82s)]
*  And so, you know these funds now [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2837.14s)]
*  I mean if you're tiger or some of these big funds you have giant [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2839.2999999999997s)]
*  Cost bases that you've created because of the the size of the firm that you created [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2843.7599999999998s)]
*  The third is the nature of lps and bill mentioned, you know, dave swenson [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2848.4199999999996s)]
*  in 2002 [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2853.7s)]
*  MIT, yale harvard, they would call, you know, who were the early backers of venture firms [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2855.7799999999997s)]
*  They would call these venture guys up and say listen we're hurting there were a lot of markdowns [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2860.66s)]
*  We need to slow down the pace of deployment, right? And so [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2865.4599999999996s)]
*  They were a factor lp said slow it down [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2869.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm not hearing that out of lps today [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2874.3399999999997s)]
*  Okay, and I think one of these change I certainly am hearing it out of traditional lps some family offices some endowments [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2877.62s)]
*  but pensions [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2885.54s)]
*  Sovereign wealth funds etc who now represent a much bigger percentage of the total capital base of venture [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2886.98s)]
*  They have money coming out of the ground every day that they need to deploy like they did in private equity [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2893.7000000000003s)]
*  And so again, i'm not saying this for certain and certainly there are more discerning sovereign wealth funds than others [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2899.38s)]
*  Who are saying don't speed up the pace of deployment? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2906.26s)]
*  But i'm wondering if that nature that change in the nature of the lp base is also contributing to this [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2909.54s)]
*  You know as as sacs called ai mania [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2916.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean we see it in hollywood some new actors come in they want to [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2919.3799999999997s)]
*  Build a brand we saw the russians do it. We saw the japanese do it [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2924.18s)]
*  You see china do it people come in new entrants at the table. They get splashy-cashy [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2928.5s)]
*  They want to place a lot of bets. They want to make a name for some build a brand [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2932.4199999999996s)]
*  So that's an interesting counterpoint our entire business, of course is based on exits the highest form of exit [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2935.22s)]
*  I guess is an ipo an overpriced acquisition would be the second [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2940.4199999999996s)]
*  Secondary market for shares as a distant third [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2944.58s)]
*  Looks like the ipo window might be cracking open a bit and uh, some people are being forced the guns to the head [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2948.42s)]
*  arm [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2957.54s)]
*  Owned by softbank masayoshi san looking to raise 10 billion had a 50 60 70 billion dollar valuation could be the largest ipo of the year [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2958.3399999999997s)]
*  Instacart looking at a 12 billion dollar valuation reddit kind of went dark. They had a couple of problems [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2966.3399999999997s)]
*  With their community, but they were in line stripe obviously in line [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2972.02s)]
*  Clavio, it's got a five billion dollar valuation and then we saw a couple of [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2976.58s)]
*  What i'll say are non-traditional companies going public something called shark ninja [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2981.3s)]
*  I saw in public we had a little conversation about this brad kershner [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2986.34s)]
*  They have a market cap of 4.3 billion. They had a pop of 40 percent. Hava a greek food chain upa [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2989.94s)]
*  They went public and have a market cap of five billion dollars [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2996.5s)]
*  Surfer a company i'd [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=2999.7s)]
*  Passed on investing in but was intrigued by they do pelotus [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3001.7s)]
*  Shuttles between places on the west coast here little short runs. They did a direct listing in july [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3005.14s)]
*  Market cap of 85 million didn't go well [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3011.7s)]
*  Bill girly is uh the ipo window opening [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3015.3s)]
*  Or are people kind of on the ledge who have no choice but to jump and hope for the best one thing we didn't [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3019.3s)]
*  Spend enough time on in the last topic which i'll just hit on briefly is the complexity of those unicorns [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3026.18s)]
*  So brad mentioned I saw a deck that said there were more [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3031.54s)]
*  Private unicorns than public tech companies so for a billion dollars at one point at a time [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3035.54s)]
*  Which is shocking but those [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3041.3799999999997s)]
*  Because those companies grew up in the [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3043.9399999999996s)]
*  99-20-21 [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3046.8199999999997s)]
*  Time frame where you could raise money at excessive valuation [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3048.74s)]
*  21 time frame where you could raise money at excessive valuation [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3051.54s)]
*  Their cap charts are very complex and rigid they have different licked preferences at different places [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3055.46s)]
*  And and and they've got board members who all have different marks [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3061.38s)]
*  And are all very worried about whether this thing can get to a certain place or not [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3065.54s)]
*  And so it's very difficult to come in and do another private round in those situations. You might have to [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3069.86s)]
*  You know, you might have to put the return in a guaranteed [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3076.02s)]
*  Pick dividend to ipo or some complex derivative [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3079.56s)]
*  And a lot of people I think brad would agree with this a lot of people just say [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3083.32s)]
*  They opt out and say no, this is too hard [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3087.56s)]
*  I'm not going to go in there and negotiate with five different constituencies on how to do this. You can't [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3089.48s)]
*  Just do a simple investment because of that. Okay, so it's gotten too complex which then if [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3095.4s)]
*  The buyers of those shares do not want to be involved in that crazy [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3101.64s)]
*  Okay, is stripe worth or just pick stripe as an example 50 billion or 100 billion and the last investors are at 100 [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3105.88s)]
*  Yc in a two million. Yeah [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3111.96s)]
*  A bad example just because their total lick pref stack may still be a fraction of their market cap for [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3114.6800000000003s)]
*  A lot of these unicorns the lick pref stack can be very close to their market cap [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3120.6800000000003s)]
*  Whether today's valuation and that's what creates so you have a structural problem [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3125.4s)]
*  You got a billion dollars in investment in the company and liquidation [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3130.52s)]
*  Money that has to come out to pay those investors, but the company's only worth two billion or a billion [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3134.28s)]
*  And now it's yeah when you get to that place sometimes going public is just the easiest way to clean it all up [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3138.2s)]
*  Because everybody converts to common [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3145.0s)]
*  And we just the company starts trading and reality is reality. It's kind of like taking the medicine [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3147.16s)]
*  Yeah, and and I think that happened one good example was square at one point had done a derivative financing on top that was [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3152.52s)]
*  Somewhat problematic and they just felt like they had to get out [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3160.28s)]
*  And they did and it cleaned up the cap chart and one thing i've been waiting on [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3164.2s)]
*  We'll see if it happens, but because of hyper competition and investing in 99 2020 2023 on [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3168.36s)]
*  There was a term removed for most term sheets that gave [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3175.88s)]
*  Investors the right to protect their lick pref on ipo that's [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3180.2s)]
*  Gone in most of these cases [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3184.2s)]
*  So you could convert lick pref under which for a founder or an early stage angel investor would be [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3186.2s)]
*  A huge win. Got it. Whereas if you sold a company in m&a the lick pref would play does that make sense? [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3194.12s)]
*  Yes, so the last investor comes in they're getting a multiple of their money back [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3201.08s)]
*  Except in an ipo, right? And so if the ipo happens, you know, yeah, and I suspect most of those late stage investors [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3205.64s)]
*  Keep assume that their investment has a debt-like floor [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3213.24s)]
*  On lick pref and if this were to start to happen or recaps which can also be done [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3218.04s)]
*  The self-inflicted recaps I have seen many times just to get past the structural complexity [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3223.3999999999996s)]
*  Either one of those things could wipe out that lick pref [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3229.96s)]
*  So net net girly more ipos are going to happen. I think you will see there's two things [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3233.72s)]
*  I think that complex cleaning up complexity [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3239.8s)]
*  Is a great reason for the public market and brad already said we've seen a massive recovery in [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3242.52s)]
*  in [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3249.2400000000002s)]
*  Software stocks like the marks are better than they were [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3250.28s)]
*  Two years ago, so brad or sax just m&a wise we've seen lena con we've discussed it many times [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3254.84s)]
*  Seems to be saying all business equals bad any merger equals bad [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3262.76s)]
*  She's gonna, you know attempt to throw cold water on any merger that's happening [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3267.4s)]
*  so [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3273.1600000000003s)]
*  m&a [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3274.76s)]
*  Seems to be being taken off the plate by not just lena con but also the eu's is seems to be turning the screws [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3276.1200000000003s)]
*  So if we don't have an m&a market, then that means there's only an ipo mark [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3282.36s)]
*  Correct. I mean that's just another one of the reasons that is pressuring these companies these companies need to raise capital [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3286.84s)]
*  So just to double click on what bill said and put some numbers around it, right because [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3293.32s)]
*  We read a lot of stats about how many ipos there were so I had the team pull some figures [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3297.7200000000003s)]
*  480 ipos us ipos in 2020 [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3302.82s)]
*  a thousand thirty five so a huge bubble in 21 [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3307.06s)]
*  a hundred and eighty one in 22 and a hundred in 23 [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3311.06s)]
*  Okay, but I think that overstates [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3315.56s)]
*  Right because we had a lot of SPACs and crappy ipos so it really overstates the quality ipos [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3317.96s)]
*  So, you know, we're one of the major buyers in tech ipos [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3323.88s)]
*  So I just went to the team and said how many ipos were we tracking and did we consider participating in during these years? [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3326.84s)]
*  So that was 46 in 2020 a hundred in 2021 [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3334.2s)]
*  Three in 2022 and zero year-to-date in 2023. Okay, don't want to be in the greek food [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3340.44s)]
*  So what I would say is I just returned from dear valley this week where morgan stanley's putting on a conference [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3347.88s)]
*  Talking to their big potential ipo buyers [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3353.64s)]
*  We are now queued up [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3356.52s)]
*  As you and I we had this tweet exchange jason this week and I said, you know in that exchange the world's normalized fear of covid's past [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3358.44s)]
*  hyperinflations past etc [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3366.98s)]
*  First-class ipos are coming and a bunch of down-round ipos are coming. So let me just explain really quickly on that [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3369.32s)]
*  Right, you mentioned instacart [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3375.32s)]
*  Right super high quality company. I think its last private round was 50 or 60 billion in the bubble [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3377.8s)]
*  And now it's rumored to be going public at somewhere around 10 billion dollars. Okay, so that [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3383.2400000000002s)]
*  represents the reset that will have to happen and as bill said [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3389.14s)]
*  if you were a [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3393.4s)]
*  Investor in that last round of instacart and you were buying preferred shares and thought you were protected [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3395.08s)]
*  That preference is washed right so you're going to be down 50 60 70 percent on those preferred shares [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3400.44s)]
*  Because you're going to be converted into common in that ipo. It's the right thing for the company to do [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3407.0s)]
*  It's the right thing for the investors to do it cleans up the cap table. So that is an example [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3411.96s)]
*  Of you know the down-round ipos of high quality companies that you're going to see come public [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3417.88s)]
*  Then you're going to have folks like arm like bite dance [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3423.1600000000003s)]
*  Databricks would be another one of these I think that you know sneak that would be more in that instacart camp [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3426.52s)]
*  You know like there will be some discount relative perhaps to their fully diluted last rounds valuation [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3432.04s)]
*  But these make no mistake about our high quality companies that will lubricate and altimeter will compete for those ipos [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3438.2s)]
*  Because these bankers are hell bent on pricing these ipos at a discount to fair value [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3444.7599999999998s)]
*  They need them to work [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3450.04s)]
*  They need to bring buyers back into the ipo market because these companies need liquidity [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3451.16s)]
*  So suddenly the banks [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3455.8s)]
*  Need to get wins for the people buying these shares as opposed to in the past [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3458.6000000000004s)]
*  They were like, yeah, we're just selling a security at the market rate. Whatever that famous [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3463.48s)]
*  The famous monologue from [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3469.6400000000003s)]
*  What was the movie we was that jeremy irons who gives that monologue we're selling securities to [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3472.6800000000003s)]
*  Informed buyers and that's it. It's a pretty [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3477.1600000000003s)]
*  Dark scene so it won't be a light switch jason, but I do think margin call margin call. Thank you [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3480.68s)]
*  It was jeremy irons. I don't think it'll look like a light switch, but it will be I think we're going to see five six [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3485.8s)]
*  Seven ipos good size ipos in q4 [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3491.08s)]
*  We'll probably see closer to 10 in q1 [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3494.68s)]
*  And then it will start opening up in the back half of next year in part because boards of directors will begin to realize [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3497.08s)]
*  You know what? [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3502.6s)]
*  We have to go public if it's down round who cares [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3504.04s)]
*  It's acceptable [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3507.48s)]
*  And this is really healthy. We need these companies and by the way i'm in the bill girly camp [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3508.84s)]
*  You should not stay private forever [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3514.44s)]
*  You should get your company if you have 100 or 200 million in revenue [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3516.04s)]
*  Get your company public innovate and grow in the public markets with the discipline and cadence of the public markets [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3519.4s)]
*  And if it's if it's you should expect the prices lower [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3524.92s)]
*  Because the world was out of their mind in 20 and 21 and multiples of reset [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3528.52s)]
*  I [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3533.72s)]
*  Sacked you shared a a news story with me just about [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3535.0s)]
*  Some of the incredible returns in the golden hour venture capital [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3538.92s)]
*  washington university [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3542.84s)]
*  duke university some of these endowments just [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3544.6s)]
*  Exploded in value. Yeah, I remember when this article came out. It was september 29th [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3547.72s)]
*  2021 less than two years ago. Yeah, and we were all feeling really good about our industry [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3552.58s)]
*  Yeah, but as it turns out the whole thing was inflated by all the free money that the fed had airdrop [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3558.12s)]
*  So, you know the public markets were really frothy. It was basically very bubbly especially for growth stocks [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3566.2s)]
*  You had all these new ipos and spacks and so forth and they were super bubbly [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3572.92s)]
*  and the result was that the returns both [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3578.92s)]
*  Realized returns and on paper for these endowments were massive [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3583.56s)]
*  So if you think about the lp the lp community if they're making commitments in 2021 [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3587.24s)]
*  The way they do that is they look at the total value of their endowments and then they allocate a certain percentage [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3593.64s)]
*  By asset class so they'll allocate a certain percentage to public markets certain percentage to real estate private equity and then vc [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3599.88s)]
*  So if the overall value of the endowment is really big then that percentage that goes to vc is going to be really big too [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3607.4s)]
*  And then what happened is you had this huge correction over the next couple of years [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3614.3599999999997s)]
*  And so one of the things we heard from the lp community last year [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3618.52s)]
*  Is a problem they called the denominator effect where explain. Yep. Well the value of their [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3621.8799999999997s)]
*  Portfolios had gone down a lot because the public markets were down [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3628.58s)]
*  What was it something like 50% in some cases? Yeah for growth stocks and like 15 20 for the entire market [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3632.04s)]
*  Right, so the value of the portfolio was down [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3638.52s)]
*  But the venture capital part of that was not down both because of the the lag in getting fresh marks [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3640.6s)]
*  And then also because they had already made commitments [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3647.48s)]
*  To new vc funds at the peak of the market. So [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3651.48s)]
*  All of a sudden the percentage of their portfolio that was vc related [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3654.2799999999997s)]
*  Roughly doubled and so that's why all of a sudden the lp commitments have dried up is because they're over allocated [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3658.6s)]
*  To vc. Yeah now all right as the public markets have come back this year then that problem [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3665.88s)]
*  Mitigates to some degree, but yes, I think it's still out there and I think this is why [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3672.02s)]
*  You're seeing certainly domestic [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3676.6s)]
*  Lps really slow their allocations to venture capitals. They still have the denominator problem [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3679.14s)]
*  Now I think that's less of an issue overseas [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3685.08s)]
*  I think jacob you observe that the the four seasons of the the bar at the [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3687.4s)]
*  Dubai bar looked like the rosewood to brad [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3692.6s)]
*  We were there. I literally got stopped four times from the elevator to the front door. I am not kidding four people stopped me [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3696.2s)]
*  That's two more than would stop me at the rosewood going to the front door. It was [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3704.44s)]
*  You should recognize that as a hyper attractor for where available money [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3708.8399999999997s)]
*  was [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3714.04s)]
*  Yes, relative to the u.s dollars and whether they were available or not [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3714.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think we're in for a period here of just continued distress and pain even though [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3720.04s)]
*  The market has sort of normalized or stabilized now again. I just think we've been in a huge software recession for the last year [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3726.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think that it's been masked by the fact that the rest of the economy seems to be okay [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3733.48s)]
*  But this is the worst software recession we've been in I think since the dot-com crash [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3738.04s)]
*  I mean the buyers have been laying off employees by the thousands and since software is bought on a per seat basis [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3743.0s)]
*  Yep, the the market has really condensed. We had one startup that was selling to twitter [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3749.7999999999997s)]
*  And they got a renewal and I think their contract was 80% off 80% off because elon's laid off 8% of the employees [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3755.72s)]
*  Yeah, and I told them that before negotiating the last 20% which you could negotiate 50% off that [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3763.0s)]
*  I told him they did a great job. He's getting that 20% because elon's cancelling everything [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3768.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I was like really impressed. They were able to renew at 20% of last year's value [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3773.0s)]
*  You know what we had a bender we had a bender and this bender went on for far too long [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3777.56s)]
*  And you know what if you go out, you know, two or three nights in a row until four or five in the morning [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3783.0s)]
*  That next week is going to be painful and suffering. That's what the industry is going through [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3788.44s)]
*  it's just going to take a lot of cold plunges and infrared and pickleball and [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3792.04s)]
*  You know salads to feel good again in this industry. I would [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3797.24s)]
*  Like in in retrospect that I think super interesting about the venture capital cycle one [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3801.08s)]
*  I think it's inherently cyclical and it's always going to be that way unless we fundamentally change the structure of the industry [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3806.36s)]
*  Because it just invites competition and there's no barriers to entry [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3813.4s)]
*  but I went and talked to some lps that have been in the business for a very long period of time and [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3818.04s)]
*  A vast majority of the reason venture outperforms other asset classes [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3823.88s)]
*  Has to do with these tiny windows when you have a super prodding market [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3828.84s)]
*  And if you don't if you aren't around for that part [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3833.2400000000002s)]
*  You know if you strip those years out of a 40 year assessment, it's actually not that interesting an asset class [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3837.4s)]
*  Which highlights the need for venture funds to get liquidity at the peak? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3844.28s)]
*  Yes [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3850.92s)]
*  Right when we are at the peak is when people get the most brazen the most confident and they start talking about how we're going to hold [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3851.96s)]
*  forever and so you had [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3858.36s)]
*  Venture firms with the biggest positions they've ever had in their entire life go over the waterfall [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3860.6800000000003s)]
*  And and basically evaporate what could have been returned [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3867.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean diamond diamond hands can come back and bite you and you've said famously you can't what was the line? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3871.32s)]
*  You had your candy at irr. Well, you can't yeah, I don't think I said it but it's been said. Yeah [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3877.1600000000003s)]
*  Since we're on our movie bender here for those of you haven't seen margin call [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3883.4s)]
*  Just one of the great scenes this is the best scene [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3887.7999999999997s)]
*  The whole scene by the way, it's like the best scene [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3890.92s)]
*  I think of modern finance films. So look at this murderous. Are we selling this to [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3893.8799999999997s)]
*  Same people we've been selling it to for the last two years and whoever else will buy it [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3898.92s)]
*  But john if you do this you will kill the market for years. It's over [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3903.3199999999997s)]
*  And you're selling something that you know has no value [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3910.52s)]
*  We are selling to willing buyers of the current fair market price so that we may survive [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3913.88s)]
*  Oh man, you're gonna rationalize a lot on wall street, man [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3925.7200000000003s)]
*  But yeah, but to the point but what bill's saying is that the opposite took place [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3929.0s)]
*  Which is vcs drank the kool-aid and didn't sell when we were at the peak of the market [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3933.4s)]
*  they also got caught up in a competition of trying to [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3939.08s)]
*  To uh appeal to the founder community of saying hey, we're in it forever. We're gonna hold forever. We're your best friend forever [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3942.7599999999998s)]
*  But bill there there was also this element that drove that [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3951.0s)]
*  strategic rationale this data set [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3955.7799999999997s)]
*  Which is the best performers? [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3958.3599999999997s)]
*  in tech [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3961.24s)]
*  Generated most of the value after they went public [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3962.52s)]
*  I mean, you know, there's a trillion dollars of market value generated in invidia in apple in google in amazon [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3965.64s)]
*  all [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3972.7599999999998s)]
*  over the many years post going public and you know if you read sequoias notes when they [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3973.64s)]
*  kind of made the transition that they made they said we don't want to [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3978.7599999999998s)]
*  You know walk away from the power law that the power law continues to accumulate and accrue [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3982.8399999999997s)]
*  Even in the public markets and we want to continue to participate in that because there's another [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3988.2s)]
*  100x upside coming from here in the ones that we select we want to stay with not necessarily [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3991.96s)]
*  We're going to stay in all of them. You have to be there are some that we believe are still [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=3996.6s)]
*  100x upside from here and just because there's an ipo doesn't mean that we want to exit the position that there's now [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4000.92s)]
*  More capital available to them more public currency they can use to do transactions to hire etc [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4006.92s)]
*  And we want to participate in that value creation totally and the last double could be the biggest right bill [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4012.44s)]
*  I think the total number of companies that meet that criteria in the history of the venture industry is like 10 or 15 [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4016.52s)]
*  and then you name many of them and the problem is that [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4023.72s)]
*  The rhetoric becomes common narrative and it becomes part of the ethos of the firm [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4028.04s)]
*  And people want to apply it to every single company to everything. That's right. Right totally and that's not true [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4033.4s)]
*  And it doesn't apply. I mean, I I don't want to get too specific here, but [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4039.08s)]
*  You had a company you had you know, you do have some let's say, uh [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4043.0s)]
*  Season vets yourself included bill who when given the opportunity to get liquidity [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4047.24s)]
*  On an incredible investment will do so fred wilson [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4052.84s)]
*  Sold I think all of coinbase when it goes public. He he just clears the position when things go public [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4056.2s)]
*  That's been his philosophy kind of the antithesis of what sugoi and ruloff are doing with some of their holdings [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4061.56s)]
*  And then we've seen uh, we work has an existential crisis. They don't think this might be a viable concern [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4067.88s)]
*  Concern anymore, but famously benchmark was able to sell shares at a very high valuation at some point and lock in an incredible return [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4074.04s)]
*  Yeah [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4081.56s)]
*  Yeah, okay there it is folks [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4084.52s)]
*  So [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4089.08s)]
*  Let me ask you a question bill about getting older [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4091.48s)]
*  Well, let me ask the question [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4094.2s)]
*  Let me ask you a question about getting older and wiser [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4097.0s)]
*  Well, sac like free bird wants to be the world's 17th best moderator go sex you have an investment in spacex, right? [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4099.16s)]
*  I mean there's been a lot of secondary action in spacex [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4105.8s)]
*  Why would you not sell spacex at this valuation today or would you maybe did he? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4108.28s)]
*  As you kind of think about this. Yeah, I think we're gonna wait till the company ipos [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4112.5199999999995s)]
*  I think that would be our default when it goes public sex [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4116.84s)]
*  Do you then think what's the upside from here or do you think my job is done? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4119.4s)]
*  I think my job is done. Yeah, I think my job is done [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4124.599999999999s)]
*  I think what we do is just distribute the shares and then each lp can make their own decision [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4127.5599999999995s)]
*  That's about whether they want to hold it or not [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4131.48s)]
*  And you as a chief you can decide what you want to do with your share [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4133.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, one of the nice things about distributions is that nobody has to sell [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4135.96s)]
*  So everyone can make their own decision about whether to hold or not. Yeah, once the company is public and the public has all the information [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4141.64s)]
*  Through disclosures the odds that I know something special [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4148.68s)]
*  That a seasoned public market investor [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4152.92s)]
*  doesn't [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4155.72s)]
*  That's probably pretty low. I mean the great [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4157.16s)]
*  Paradox of what we all do and brad you have both a public and a private portfolio. I started trading [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4161.38s)]
*  Public market equities to get better at my private behavior bill. You've done that forever [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4169.080000000001s)]
*  Is public markets you can't trade on inside information private companies. That's all you're trading on [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4173.400000000001s)]
*  Maybe you could speak to a little bit about being [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4178.68s)]
*  What do they call it when you do both crossover investors that make you a crossover investor? Is that the proper term? [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4181.56s)]
*  Well bill girly's the original crossover investor. He's been trading public stocks since you know, and he'd been doing that [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4187.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah researching him, you know [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4193.72s)]
*  But you know the fact of the matter as has warren buffett and you know who? [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4195.48s)]
*  Would laugh at the idea of a crossover fund [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4199.48s)]
*  He's been running one of the world's largest public portfolios and private portfolios forever [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4201.4s)]
*  He would say I invest in great companies that are mispriced. There are moments in the market cycle [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4205.719999999999s)]
*  Where late stage venture is mispriced to the downside and there are moments in the cycle where the public markets are [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4210.919999999999s)]
*  mispriced to the downside what we saw in 2021 [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4218.259999999999s)]
*  Is the private private markets were crazily overvalued in 2022 we had this massive correction in the public markets [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4222.06s)]
*  We believed that they overshot in part. We believe that because we didn't think we were going to have hyperinflation forever, etc [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4230.22s)]
*  And so you and I invested in you know meta and a lot of other things that were on their ass [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4237.34s)]
*  You've got to buy in the public market when there's blood in the streets, right? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4244.14s)]
*  As as warren as buffett says buy when there's blood in the streets and sell when there's trumpets in the air [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4247.74s)]
*  And you know, there are definitely blood in the streets when you saw things down 60 70 80 90 [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4253.18s)]
*  Is it trumpets now? Does it feel like trumpets to you now or does it feel like trumpets next quarter or the quarter after? [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4258.54s)]
*  If you look at people are polishing those trumpets right now [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4264.54s)]
*  Yeah [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4267.42s)]
*  I mean a lot of it obviously depends on your view on what's going to happen in the economy fundamentally and i'm happy to shift [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4267.74s)]
*  To that but what I would say is this [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4274.62s)]
*  Remember the chart that i've showed many time about software internet valuations [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4276.94s)]
*  We were you know 70 above normal and then we were 30 below normal and now we're closer [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4280.86s)]
*  Uh to the trailing 10-year average of internet and software valuations [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4287.099999999999s)]
*  There are always outliers on both sides of this [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4291.099999999999s)]
*  But I would say a lot of the positive arbitrage that we saw in 22 has been squeezed out of the public markets [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4293.74s)]
*  And we're close to fair value. So now if you want to generate alpha [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4299.58s)]
*  This is going to be about picking individual winners versus individual losers [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4303.66s)]
*  This is going to you know, like the beta trade on [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4307.9800000000005s)]
*  On global macro, I think has largely played out, you know the catch up back to kind of fair value [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4311.5s)]
*  And now I think there's a debate between kind of hard landing soft landing [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4317.820000000001s)]
*  Are we going to have a reacceleration inflation or not have a reacceleration where you come down on these major issues? [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4321.66s)]
*  I think dictates whether or not [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4327.02s)]
*  You know now's a good time for us now [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4329.42s)]
*  I mean, uh, wait, can I correct something you said jake hell? Yeah, please. All right. All right. So you said that [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4331.42s)]
*  Public markets inside information isn't allowed whereas private markets. It's all inside information [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4337.58s)]
*  I think that could give viewers a misleading impression of what we do as vcs [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4343.26s)]
*  Okay [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4347.74s)]
*  The way that around typically comes together [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4348.62s)]
*  It's not like we get tipped off by some insider at the company in some, you know nefarious way [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4350.78s)]
*  What happens is that the company chooses to engage with us or a select number of firms in a process [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4357.419999999999s)]
*  And then gives us [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4364.62s)]
*  Their metrics and you know gives us the business plan it gives us the forecast and it's all done in a very above board way [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4366.139999999999s)]
*  It's not like we're being tipped. However [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4372.78s)]
*  the part of it that I guess [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4375.66s)]
*  is true is that [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4377.419999999999s)]
*  A private company does not necessarily engage with everyone in the world [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4379.66s)]
*  Yes, they don't put on a website a quarterly report and say here's what our revenue and our costs were and here's our earnings although some [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4384.06s)]
*  private companies [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4390.46s)]
*  Do start that process? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4391.9s)]
*  Like by and large by and large they don't by and large [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4393.66s)]
*  They're selective about who they want to be on their cap table and that's the big difference and who they want to share [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4396.38s)]
*  Private a public company doesn't care who's on its cap table. It doesn't really know who's got you know, apple doesn't know [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4402.14s)]

*  I mean they may care who their biggest shareholders are but they don't care who the average shareholder is [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4414.94s)]
*  whereas a private company really does care and part of the reason why they care is because [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4419.18s)]
*  these startups are highly risky and they want to [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4423.58s)]
*  Have investors who have a track record of behavior where they don't have to worry about being sued [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4428.22s)]
*  Every time something doesn't work out, which is most of the time [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4433.98s)]
*  So I think there's good reasons why [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4437.660000000001s)]
*  Startups want to control who their investors are by the way, there's also the issue of value add right? I mean other things being equal [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4441.320000000001s)]
*  Founders and startups would rather have investors who can help them as opposed to simply, you know, junk you public [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4448.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean you mentioned both centers. You don't want somebody who's a neophyte [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4454.9400000000005s)]
*  Who's going to cause chaos and be upset when revenue goes down or things are swinging up and down? [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4457.9800000000005s)]
*  And yeah, if you're public, yeah buy the share if you want or sell the share if you want it's a marketplace [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4463.580000000001s)]

*  Last month any tech venture investor who compares their funds returned to the snp is being naive or disingenuous [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4489.66s)]
*  The correct index to compare to is the qqq, you know the nasdaq composite and its performance has been mind-boggling [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4497.26s)]
*  And as you can see here [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4504.3s)]
*  over a 20-year investment period [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4505.98s)]
*  If you basically just buy the top 10 public tech stocks [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4509.5s)]
*  And at the end of each year rebalance [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4514.62s)]
*  To the top 10 at the end of the year [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4517.0199999999995s)]
*  Your multiple over that period of time is 24x [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4519.98s)]
*  over 20 years [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4524.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, and over a 10-year period there's quite a bit of hindsight bias here and saying we're only looking at the top 10 [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4525.98s)]
*  Right. It's like how the hell do you determine? [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4531.0199999999995s)]
*  You know, why not top 20? Why not top 100? [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4533.74s)]
*  I mean, are you willing to say that for the next 10 years that you should only buy the top 10? [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4536.46s)]
*  What if over the next 10 years it's more of the field versus the top 10, you know the next top 5 [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4541.1s)]
*  Yeah, I think comparing vc [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4547.5s)]
*  As an asset class to the nasdaq makes a lot of sense. Yes, I think that's fair [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4549.58s)]
*  Yeah, and that's that's the second column [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4554.14s)]
*  from the right [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4556.78s)]
*  Which is basically qqq you would yeah 5.2 x over 10 years [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4558.38s)]
*  So if you're not beating 5.2 x which is a totally liquid investment if you just bought the qqq index [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4563.74s)]
*  What this really shows is apple [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4569.58s)]
*  google [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4572.14s)]
*  Facebook and amazon have had an massive run-up. Well, that's not that's not true [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4573.1s)]
*  That's that's actually not true jcow because if you look at just the static [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4578.78s)]
*  It doesn't you know outperform. It's the rebalance that outperforms [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4583.66s)]
*  Which is whoever's winning in the market meaning whoever's gaining market value each year [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4587.42s)]
*  Is who you then you know double down your dollars into for next year and that's changed over a 20 year cycle over a 10 year cycle [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4592.0599999999995s)]
*  And it really starts to play out over time. But I mean, yeah, if you just look at the qqq [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4599.0199999999995s)]
*  That's the benchmark as an investor [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4603.18s)]
*  As a private investor and you know gokul's comment in his uh, in his tweet [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4605.820000000001s)]
*  Is that uh, you know if they can return call it seven to eight x over 10 years or in this case five x over 10 years [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4611.02s)]
*  You could argue that a venture fund needs to return a significant premium probably a 25 30 premium due to the illiquidity in the [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4616.22s)]
*  The riskiness of the investment cycle there. Whereas the qqq you can just sell anytime you want [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4622.62s)]
*  So, you know call it a you know, you need to kind of be demonstrating a 30 premium [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4627.34s)]
*  to the uh 5.2 x tenure which is [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4631.58s)]
*  About six and a half seven x called seven x cash on cash [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4634.78s)]
*  I mean according to this the venture asset class is super overfunded. So why why is that then? [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4637.58s)]
*  Gurley do you have a point of view? [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4644.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it would be completely speculative but I I do think [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4646.3s)]
*  If you look at the structure of endowments, you know, you've you've had a few people [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4650.9400000000005s)]
*  Really leading the way in terms of a playbook with swenson, you know dave swenson who've passed away recently [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4656.22s)]
*  But but davis went to create a modern [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4663.18s)]
*  He ran yales endowment and is considering and [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4666.9400000000005s)]
*  I think you know the vast majority of people decided they were going to follow that playbook which had a [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4670.06s)]
*  You know oversized investment in illiquid assets pe [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4676.54s)]
*  venture real estate [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4681.1s)]
*  uh commodities those kind of things and I think it led to just a massive like [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4683.240000000001s)]
*  And and these things take forever to figure out if they're right or not [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4689.18s)]
*  If your portfolio is over 50% illiquid, like who knows what's right and what's wrong? [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4694.06s)]
*  You could do a you know, you could there were years where yale was printing like 27% a year [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4700.06s)]
*  And then in in one reset no nine [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4706.7s)]
*  Wiped out, you know a ton of that so it's super hard to know but but I do think that philosophy [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4710.14s)]
*  Became broadly adopted [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4717.66s)]
*  Yeah, well look at um, can you pull up this chart real quick? [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4720.06s)]
*  This is a chart from satista that is value of venture capital investment in the u.s from 2006 to 2022 [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4722.860000000001s)]
*  And what you see is there's there's basically a few different levels before [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4731.02s)]
*  2014 call it the industry was basically a 50 billion dollar a year industry in terms of deployments [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4737.400000000001s)]
*  Then you had a run-up where for several years it was around 100 billion and then [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4743.92s)]
*  In the pre-pandemic years 2018 1920. It was around 150 billion a year of deployment [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4749.84s)]
*  And then it went totally nuts in 2021. It was 350 billion started to come down [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4755.6s)]
*  in 2022 [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4761.12s)]
*  To about 250 billion. I think where we are right now is kind of at that [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4762.64s)]
*  2019 level of about 150 billion a year [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4767.74s)]
*  The question is like what it should be. I mean should this be a 150 billion a year industry should this be a [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4770.799999999999s)]
*  100 billion a year industry should this be a 50 billion dollar a year industry? [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4776.4s)]
*  Yeah, it sounds like 100 to 150 would would have been the steady state and bill some portion of this is [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4780.799999999999s)]
*  Stay private longer having an impact where those last couple of rounds were the big [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4787.36s)]
*  huge juicy rounds [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4792.799999999999s)]
*  And if people had gone public in year seven eight nine like microsoft google [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4794.799999999999s)]
*  Not google, but microsoft and i mean google went what year was google when it went out eight? [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4800.08s)]
*  You know going out a little bit earlier would have chopped off some percentage of this growing [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4805.04s)]
*  Yeah, and I I do think one of the most interesting things to watch is going to be how these 1000 unicorns [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4810.24s)]
*  Private unicorns play out because not only do they have the cap structure problem [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4816.72s)]
*  But they lived and grew up in a day and age where they were told growth at all costs [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4821.84s)]
*  and [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4826.96s)]
*  It it's super hard culturally to go from that type of execution to the principal type execution [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4827.76s)]
*  You guys have been promoting over the past several months. It's just hard. It's not impossible, but it's very very [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4834.96s)]
*  Google went public in year six. Yep. That's 23 million of total venture raised. I think prior to ipo [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4841.360000000001s)]
*  I mean think about what that means if a lot of those unicorns are fake. What does that say about? [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4848.56s)]
*  Innovation in the american economy [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4854.64s)]
*  We had this narrative over the last decade that the pace of innovation had fundamentally increased because of the availability of tools and technology [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4856.32s)]
*  And so you had a lot more unicorns being created. I mean, I remember [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4864.0s)]
*  Back in I don't know like a decade ago or 2010 [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4868.24s)]
*  era, let's say [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4872.96s)]
*  You know, there were maybe was like 20 to 50 unicorns a year maybe 20 unicorns a year [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4875.04s)]
*  There were [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4881.5199999999995s)]
*  Arguably 10 to 20 girly great companies formed a year in silken valley or in the tech industry [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4882.5599999999995s)]
*  in the west [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4889.04s)]
*  I remember when andresen kind of gave this this talk about it maybe a dozen years ago [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4892.16s)]
*  He said the number was 17. There's like 17 [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4897.12s)]
*  Important companies created every year in silken valley and your goals vc is to be in one of those 17 [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4899.679999999999s)]
*  Then all of a sudden we had was it like 100 200 300 unicorns a year [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4905.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean if you answer the questions, how many of them are real? Well, I mean brab was just talking about that [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4910.320000000001s)]
*  You're giving a 50x [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4915.4400000000005s)]
*  Multiple 50 times top line i'm not talking about earnings folks [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4918.56s)]
*  I'm talking about top line if you give 50x to every company [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4921.280000000001s)]
*  Then you only need 20 million dollars in revenue to be a unicorn and that's unrealistic when compared to the public markets where things [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4924.08s)]
*  Are trading at five times top line and 20 times earnings if it's high growth, right? So is it just a different market? All right? [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4929.76s)]
*  There's a major slowdown in china [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4937.2s)]
*  Or we could talk about portnoy and buy [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4939.76s)]
*  Let's do markets just real quick [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4943.360000000001s)]
*  I've spent a lot of time on the island of maui [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4946.72s)]
*  I think it's really sad. I don't know if you guys ever been to lahaina the whole town [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4949.6s)]
*  Beautiful town. So sad. Yeah, it's gone. I just wanted to make sure that we mentioned it because uh, yes pretty depressing [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4953.2s)]

*  These fires and wind man. What a hot summer. I mean we could do it in southern iran [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4986.8s)]
*  Check this out. The temperature hit 155 degrees [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4991.92s)]
*  It is nine degrees warmer than it's ever been off the west coast of uh, the united states right now [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=4995.360000000001s)]
*  There was 90 degree ocean temperatures off of the florida coast [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5002.72s)]
*  The sea surface temperature in the north atlantic's the highest it's ever been [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5006.88s)]
*  By, uh, I think seven is this global warming or is it all the hoax? [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5010.64s)]
*  Look [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5016.4800000000005s)]
*  The the people want to debate all day long about anthropogenic [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5017.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm asking you climate science here. I'm telling you with like absolute certainty the data right now is [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5020.66s)]
*  Un-fucking believable how hot and how dangerous the earth is becoming? [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5028.08s)]
*  And we're seeing not just the fire in maui the sea surface temperature, which increases the probability of severe [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5034.18s)]
*  tropical storms and hurricanes in the coming season, it's [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5040.66s)]
*  Un-livable, you know, I got like in iran in in saudi arabia in dubai [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5044.4800000000005s)]
*  130 degree temperature 95 degree overnight lows [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5049.12s)]
*  There if you don't have air conditioning you will die in a lot of these places [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5054.42s)]
*  So there are parts of the earth where people cannot afford the amenities and the luxuries that we have [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5059.219999999999s)]
*  So is it a world turn? We all just just say there is no hoax. There is no hoax [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5064.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm trying to put the softball right in front of you. Yeah, the earth is warming [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5068.82s)]
*  the amount of extreme weather [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5072.98s)]
*  Is increasing the significant effect of that is is becoming apparent [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5075.139999999999s)]
*  and [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5080.5s)]
*  You know, it's we could debate for hours about what quote can you do about it? [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5081.459999999999s)]
*  But there's just a series of really awful things happening right now [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5085.7s)]
*  Yeah, and it's becoming more frequent and more apparent that this is a pretty serious thing that we're all you have to do [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5089.219999999999s)]
*  All you have to do girly is follow what you're doing down there in texas, which has [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5094.5s)]
*  Is it the highest renewable energy? [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5098.82s)]
*  Percentage of any state now is texas [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5101.379999999999s)]
*  Greater than california. So one of the biggest accessories I saw [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5103.9400000000005s)]
*  Some politician from texas saying we got we got to get off all these renewables [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5108.58s)]
*  There's no silver bullet if you want to talk about [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5112.26s)]
*  the you know the fundamental challenge that we all face in terms of [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5114.9800000000005s)]
*  Whether atmospheric carbon is driving heating or not if you if you follow that track [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5118.74s)]
*  There is no silver bullet [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5123.7s)]
*  There is a lot of things that have to go right in a coordinated way and there are market incentives that make it very difficult [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5124.900000000001s)]
*  For any of those things to actually get done all the way through but renewable energy and [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5130.34s)]
*  Nuclear you would say are important two of the most important. Yeah, there's still industrial production [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5134.820000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's just like you the the list goes on [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5140.34s)]
*  You know systems and agriculture [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5143.620000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of the clearest what's the clearest path? [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5146.1s)]
*  I mean if you had to if you said hey put 90 of your effort on these three things it would be nuclear renewables [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5148.5s)]
*  painting [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5155.52s)]
*  People's roofs with white paint like this new paint that's reflect stuff. I mean what would be in your shirt list? [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5156.5s)]
*  That's not going to change much. No, let's see this conversation other time. We've got brad and bill here [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5162.9s)]
*  I think honestly, i'd love to have this conversation. We should do it put on the dock next week. We'll do a big thing here [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5166.66s)]
*  Yeah, so just wrapping up here [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5171.46s)]
*  on sort of macro we'll give you a little macro [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5173.54s)]
*  brad cpi [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5176.98s)]
*  Seems like it's [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5179.7s)]
*  measured and [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5181.3s)]
*  Consumers seem like they're running out of money and starting to tighten their belts unemployment [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5182.96s)]
*  Still all-time low still nine million job openings [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5188.339999999999s)]
*  Feels like um, this is the steady state for the next year. Or do you think hard landing no landing soft landing? [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5191.78s)]
*  Well, maybe they could bring up the first chart this morning. We had cpi reported [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5199.62s)]
*  We had the smallest back-to-back monthly gains in core cpi in over two years [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5203.46s)]
*  Back to point two percent annualizing just over over two percent now [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5208.580000000001s)]
*  So honey, you're over your basis. It was three point two percent now [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5212.580000000001s)]
*  Remember it was only six months ago that people were still hyperventilating [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5215.860000000001s)]
*  About you know this nine point one percent we saw last year that everybody on this pod [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5220.1s)]
*  I think was largely an agreement that was coveted stimulated but you know, the blue line here represents [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5224.42s)]
*  The consensus estimates of folks like goldman-sachs, right? [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5231.540000000001s)]
*  Which is pretty similar to what the fed's own estimates are if you go to the next [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5234.34s)]
*  Slide here nick. This is what people the current market is betting [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5239.22s)]
*  What happened to the fed funds rate? So the market is saying like, you know [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5244.5s)]
*  You've heard chamasse many times higher for longer. I happen to think we'll have higher rates for longer, too [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5248.42s)]
*  But the market is saying we're worried about an economic slowdown that's going to force the fed's hand [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5253.62s)]
*  So the market is betting that the fed funds rate will come down [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5258.58s)]
*  either because inflation continues to roll or because the economy continues to slow [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5261.86s)]
*  And so this third slide which I think is a really interesting one which which nobody really talks about but this is the reason [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5267.86s)]
*  I think truck and miller and other [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5273.54s)]
*  Are worried about recession [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5275.7s)]
*  There's a measure by the san francisco fed which is called the effective funds proxy rate [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5278.5s)]
*  Okay, so this is not the fed funds rate [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5284.74s)]
*  This is what they say the total impact [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5287.54s)]
*  of [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5291.22s)]
*  quantitative tightening plus rate hikes are [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5292.740000000001s)]
*  And we're now back to the highest level on that proxy rate since we've been since may of 2000 [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5296.34s)]
*  It's up over seven percent. I think that's the reason people are looking at this is blue line up over seven percent. That's the highest [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5302.820000000001s)]
*  effective rate [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5310.4800000000005s)]
*  Calculated by the san francisco fed since all the way back to may of 2000 and this is the concern a lot of people [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5311.86s)]
*  Could you just explain that why is the effective rate three percent higher than the official rate because of quantitative tightening? [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5317.7s)]
*  Because there's a lot of other things going on in the economy [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5325.139999999999s)]
*  The impacts interest rates the rate at which you can borrow part of it is there's just less money in the system [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5329.139999999999s)]
*  It's a credit crunch basically exactly just because the rate's four percent doesn't mean you can get you can't borrow [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5335.219999999999s)]
*  Nobody can borrow at the 10-year rate [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5340.5s)]
*  Okay [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5342.58s)]
*  So if you're a company or an individual and you want to go borrow if you have to buy at a much higher rate [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5342.82s)]
*  So that is where the rubber meets the road if you're trying to borrow to buy a house borrow to buy a car borrow to expand [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5347.86s)]
*  Your business that the blue line represents a much better, you know calibration for the level of tightening in the economy [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5353.62s)]
*  So there is a a very strong debate and I would say the market's actually betting here that the fed is overdoing it [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5360.34s)]
*  Because of what you see in that blue line and that the economy is going to slow the lag effects [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5368.26s)]
*  Of this tightening have not yet been felt and so this gets back to the question we had before which is where are we? [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5373.46s)]
*  In the cycle whether or not we're going to continue to have growth now really interesting jason [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5380.0199999999995s)]
*  Bloomberg's headline today was the summer of disinflation [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5384.72s)]
*  And we said on this pod six months ago [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5389.22s)]
*  We said it's more likely by the end of 2023 we're going to be talking about disinflation than inflation [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5391.38s)]
*  And lo and behold not only not only are are we seeing signs of disinflation air tickets down 18% year over year [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5397.379999999999s)]
*  But china just posted actual disinflation. Yeah, right. So places are coming down [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5404.74s)]
*  people are going to [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5411.219999999999s)]
*  Uh be surprised that there's more products or services available at lower prices which then could in fact the salaries [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5412.82s)]
*  Because hey, we're not making as much money at this company [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5419.0599999999995s)]
*  We got to cut salaries [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5420.98s)]
*  I mean we know that the fed at the start of covid was more like the the curses of [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5422.02s)]
*  Disinflation are almost bigger than the curses of inflation and china just saw cpi down [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5428.0s)]
*  three-tenths of one percent [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5435.040000000001s)]
*  In the month this week annualized that's over three and a half percent. That is a major problem for china [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5436.820000000001s)]
*  So I think you have some some yellow flags here [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5442.900000000001s)]
*  Right then say do we have too much tightening if one of the global engines of growth is experiencing this level of disinflation [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5446.66s)]
*  That's going to impact the global economy global demand, etc. So yeah [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5454.58s)]
*  Um, I think been the pattern of the fed right they they they seem to react late and then they oversteer [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5458.42s)]
*  This has been the theme [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5463.700000000001s)]
*  and so [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5465.3s)]
*  There's also just to add one other [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5466.820000000001s)]
*  Cloud to the silver lining it's the amount of debt that's out there correct [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5470.5s)]
*  So both private debt and government debt. Yeah consumer debt is high this real estate commercial real estate's high [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5474.9800000000005s)]
*  Get debt everywhere and people are going to have to belt tighten and maybe austerity and stop spending on [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5482.900000000001s)]
*  some yolo trips [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5488.9800000000005s)]
*  But if salaries keep going up [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5490.66s)]
*  Let's listen. This isn't a kona koa. Who is this? Who are you sharing here? It's not a kona koa link [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAfDQx8DDQ&t=5493.9400000000005s)]
