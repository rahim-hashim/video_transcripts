*  freeberg reminds me of a story for this weekend. Okay, we're [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3.96s)]

*  He will leave home without pistachios. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=33.92s)]
*  The guy says no food in the club. No, and he goes, What do [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=38.96s)]
*  you mean no food? This is in a bag. It's like it's just [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=42.52s)]

*  Who's good? Is that Jake? That's my guy. But I think it's just a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=102.44s)]
*  t shirt. I think it's just a t shirt. You obviously stopped [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  the Zempik. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=108.0s)]
*  I'm still sideways. I'm still sideways 175. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=110.16s)]

*  came right back. Vegas was so fun. I gotta say I gotta shout [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=115.64s)]
*  out to those guys that run that Delilah joint. I think that's [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=118.83999999999999s)]
*  like the best new restaurant. That is a really great place. A [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=121.32s)]
*  little loud. I wish it would just go like one notch lower on [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  the volume for the old people. Good scene. Once you hit 50. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=127.24s)]
*  All the clubs are too old. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=130.56s)]
*  And they've just gone crazy. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=142.24s)]
*  With us again on the all in podcast, the architect himself, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=148.44s)]
*  crazy hair doesn't care David sacks. Friedberg is committing [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=151.8s)]
*  suicide in the bottom of a pool. Apparently he just cannot take [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=156.52s)]
*  all the adulation and inside. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=160.36s)]
*  That's a leaving Las Vegas scene. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=162.56s)]
*  Exactly. That's you leaving Vegas down 150 dimes, which you [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=164.08s)]
*  could have given to DeSantis like sacks did and hot off of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=168.8s)]
*  his wonderful weekend. The afterglow of Vegas Chamath [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=173.12s)]
*  polyhapity. We went to Vegas to play cards. It was a wonderful [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=179.16000000000003s)]
*  weekend. We had a great time. Everybody bonded. A lot of laughs [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=182.0s)]
*  were had wonderful time. Wonderful, wonderful time. I [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=185.72000000000003s)]
*  got into craps. I was never craps guy, but I had I had one [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=189.88000000000002s)]
*  of those like great was Jay Callan craps. Oh my god. 40 I [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  had a 40 die roll run. It was incredible. There's something [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=196.88s)]
*  about that game that is like super addicting to me. Oh, when [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=200.24s)]
*  you just go on a 40 die roll. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=204.48s)]
*  I think craps really is one of the best gambling games ever [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=206.88s)]
*  created. So exciting. It's so exciting. It's so exciting. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=212.6s)]
*  It's like hitting the hard ways. And then the feature bats [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=217.48s)]
*  feature bats. Leaky bats know but when they hit they're just [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=221.16s)]
*  all the dopamine gets released loved it. I spiked aces for the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=225.88s)]
*  max bet. It was like, Oh, I saw that you put 500 on it. Yeah, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=229.0s)]
*  they only let me bet 500 but about 31 to one on aces hit it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=232.6s)]
*  Table went crazy when that 15 dimes were pushed. Speaking [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=237.28s)]
*  about pushing 150 dimes sacks you've been getting a lot of [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=241.0s)]
*  press for being the architect. I saw some stories. Let me ask [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  you a question. Total fake news. All fake news. We know that [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=247.72s)]
*  everybody's emailing me to try to get answers about you. I just [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  CC you on this but the press has been trying to cover your role [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=254.24s)]
*  architecting the Ron DeSantis president. We talked about last [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=259.44s)]
*  week. What's to cover? Well, the press wants to know what 150 [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=262.52000000000004s)]
*  dimes keys is. They can look it up in the urban dictionary. I [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=266.0s)]
*  think that would be easier. Let me ask you a question about [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=269.48s)]
*  your giving strategy or your donation strategy. I noticed [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=273.0s)]
*  that you're donating to RFK for president and you're donating to [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=277.56s)]
*  Ron DeSantis. Are you donating to any other president? And why [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=283.36s)]
*  are you betting both sides of the aisle? This is confusing to [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=288.36s)]
*  me. I thought you wanted one side to win. I mean, I've [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=290.52000000000004s)]
*  already explained this on previous pods. I don't know the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=292.32s)]
*  answer. What's the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=294.6s)]
*  the simplest way to understand my political giving is just to [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=295.6s)]
*  watch the all in pod. And I always end up describing who I'm [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=299.0s)]
*  supporting, and why and which causes on the pod first. And [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=303.04s)]
*  then I back it up. I put my money where my mouth is. So [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  there's no mystery. There's no like backroom deals going on. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=311.24s)]
*  It's just me writing checks and supportive things I've almost [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=314.64s)]
*  always already talked about on the pod. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=317.24s)]
*  Okay, so what about this question of betting both sides? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=319.47999999999996s)]
*  So you're betting for both teams in a basketball series? Like, I [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=323.91999999999996s)]
*  don't know. I don't understand that. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=328.68s)]
*  Well, I've said that it's not competitive. At this point, I've [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  said that I would support RFK Jr. for the Democratic Party [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=332.4s)]
*  nomination and I support DeSantis on the Republican side. There's [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  no contradiction. I guess if they both made it to the general, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=340.2s)]
*  then I'd have a real dilemma. But let's face it, they're both [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=344.12s)]
*  underdogs in their lane. Okay, it'd be a high class problem to [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=347.4s)]
*  have if it ended up being a DeSantis Kennedy race instead of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=351.36s)]
*  a Biden Trump repeat. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=354.76s)]
*  Well, I mean, I played blackjack with you, you do play multiple [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=356.76s)]
*  hands at once. So I guess this does this does track. It's not [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=359.2s)]
*  enough action for you to just play one hand. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't really see a contradiction there. Right now. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=365.52s)]
*  There's a Trump DeSantis race going on and there's a Biden [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=367.8s)]
*  Kennedy race going on. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  Okay, now you hold a lot of fundraisers. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=373.68s)]
*  Chamath and I are actually doing an event for Bobby Kennedy soon [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=376.52000000000004s)]
*  in the next two weeks. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=380.64s)]
*  God, let's go to you, Chamath. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=381.48s)]
*  Well, I think it's important to just acknowledge an [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=382.92s)]
*  uncomfortable truth and I come at it from a person who's [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=387.44s)]
*  independent. I'm not registered Democrat or Republican, but I've [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=392.24s)]
*  donated millions of dollars to the Democrats in the last couple [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=395.16s)]
*  of cycles. But I'm concerned about Joe Biden's mental acuity. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=398.12s)]
*  And recently, when you look at how the White House behaves, the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=406.20000000000005s)]
*  thing that I'm worried about is that there's almost like this [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=415.76000000000005s)]
*  sensation that there's a shadow government that's actually [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=418.36s)]
*  running the country. And we didn't elect any of those people. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=421.2s)]
*  And this is nothing to say anything bad about Janet Yellen [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=426.28s)]
*  or Jeff Zients or anybody else. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=429.2s)]
*  But I think it's very important to acknowledge that, you know, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=432.88s)]
*  other presidents have typically seen turnover in the highest ranks [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=435.8s)]
*  of government every two years or so. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=440.84s)]
*  And there's been incredible consistency. Now, one could say, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  well, that's a good thing. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=448.32s)]
*  The other side of it is, well, that's what allows more vibrancy [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=449.6s)]
*  in government and to make sure that the president remains always [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=453.36s)]
*  in charge. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=455.88s)]
*  And so I think it's very important in this moment, where we [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=458.64s)]
*  have a president who's 82 odd years old or however old he is, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=461.48s)]
*  we need to have the chance the American public to re underwrite [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=467.28000000000003s)]
*  his mental acuity. And I think that's a judgment that we should [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=470.6s)]
*  all be allowed to make. And I think the fairest way to do that [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=473.36s)]
*  is to feel the candidate who can be on the debate stage with him, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=477.36s)]
*  and who can actually just go toe to toe on the critical issues [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=482.0s)]
*  so that we as an American electorate can decide for [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=484.88s)]
*  ourselves, where does this issue land? Is he mentally super sharp [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=488.36s)]
*  and ready to go for another four years, in which case a lot of [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=493.96s)]
*  folks will support him? Or is this a moment where we actually [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=496.6s)]
*  need to be very responsible at the future of the country and [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  not create some puppet government situation? I don't [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=502.36s)]
*  think it's funny that we have this weekend at Bernie's like [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=505.56s)]
*  meme that goes around about him. This is the President of the [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=509.6s)]
*  United States is the most important person in the world. We [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=511.96s)]
*  can't be in a situation where like, that is a 30% probability [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=515.4s)]
*  that people joke about. So my support of Bobby Kennedy is in [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=519.96s)]
*  part because what I've heard from him, I find intriguing. But [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=525.08s)]
*  the more important thing is, somebody needs to be in the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=528.8s)]
*  arena, on the democratic side, and put to test this mental [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=532.92s)]
*  acuity construct here and get us to an answer. Because otherwise, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=538.1999999999999s)]
*  I am worried that there's a bunch of folks that were not [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=543.4799999999999s)]
*  elected, who are actually running the government. And I'm [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=545.76s)]
*  not sure how much Biden actually knows or doesn't know. And I [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=548.4s)]
*  want to know the answer to that question. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=550.8399999999999s)]
*  I think everybody wants to know the answer and feels like [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=552.16s)]
*  Democrats would like a different candidate. That's what the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=554.12s)]
*  polling is showing to be, you know, put on the field here. And [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=556.68s)]
*  there is the issue of he's had the fewest number of news [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=561.32s)]
*  conferences, we don't get to hear from him directly, which [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=563.96s)]
*  then fuels, I think, this perception Friedberg, that he's [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=566.84s)]
*  in cognitive decline, and perhaps the cognitive decline [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=573.44s)]
*  has increased. Republicans love to, and the right love to, you [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=576.08s)]
*  know, make these images of him confused on stage, who knows if [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=580.84s)]
*  he's actually confused, or if those are being selectively [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=585.0s)]
*  edited. But it certainly doesn't look good. When you [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=588.12s)]
*  don't put the person out there to face the music, and to take [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=591.24s)]
*  hard questions. I can't imagine he would do very well in a town [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=595.12s)]
*  hall or in an extended number of debates. And so this is the [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=599.08s)]
*  thing that I find truly scary is, if the guy can't make it [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=603.32s)]
*  through the debates, and he can't debate RFK and 10 other [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=606.5600000000001s)]
*  people, and he can't do news conferences, and we haven't heard [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=609.44s)]
*  directly from him or had him like face some really hard [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=614.12s)]
*  questioning, he had he did one thing on MSNBC or CNN, and it [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=617.36s)]
*  was so pathetically sycophantic. And it looked like it was highly [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=620.76s)]
*  edited, I kind of like that the the host who did it, I'll pull [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=625.4s)]
*  up her name in a minute, I forgot her name right now. She's [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=628.44s)]
*  actually pretty good. She's kind of funny, and she's kind of [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=630.6800000000001s)]
*  insightful, but she just saw through softball to softball, is [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=633.08s)]
*  there an age, sultan of science that we should have a cognitive [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=635.28s)]
*  test for, for office in your mind? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=638.76s)]
*  I don't have an opinion on that. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=643.04s)]
*  You don't? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=645.48s)]
*  On an age? I mean, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=646.8399999999999s)]
*  yeah, like, should we or should we have a cognitive test? A [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=648.28s)]
*  cognitive test, cognitive test, the President of the United [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=651.16s)]
*  States for office, like, there's also [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=654.3199999999999s)]
*  what you're saying is that when you hold debates, and you do [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=655.8399999999999s)]
*  town halls, and you do rallies, then that is a cognitive test, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=658.7199999999999s)]
*  you'll see you'll be able to take the cognitive measure, by [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=663.0799999999999s)]
*  seeing how quick on their feet they are. But if Biden doesn't [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=666.56s)]
*  debate anybody, we won't see it. And right now, they're saying [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=670.1999999999999s)]
*  they won't debate Kennedy. So that tells you right there that [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=673.96s)]
*  they're afraid of something. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=677.8000000000001s)]
*  I just want to reiterate this, this is the single most [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=679.48s)]
*  important person in the world. In the single most important [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=682.32s)]
*  job. If it breaks your brain in a moment like this, to not be [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=686.32s)]
*  partisan and think what would you do if it was the other side? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=692.96s)]
*  I just think you're like an unpatriotic rube. And you're [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=697.2s)]
*  going to get tricked. I'm not saying you, Jason, I'm saying [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=701.0400000000001s)]
*  anybody that thinks that. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=702.88s)]
*  I mean, you're a camp, I want to see him debate. Yeah. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=703.96s)]
*  Especially if the Ukraine war is still going on, because we're [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=706.1600000000001s)]
*  that close to being in a direct shooting war with Russia, which [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=708.76s)]
*  could lead to a nuclear war. So you need somebody to be [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=711.9200000000001s)]
*  contained. I'll be more worried about the relationship. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=715.76s)]
*  It's contained. I think it's escalated. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=717.88s)]
*  I don't think it's contained. It's escalating. And as of [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=719.48s)]
*  yesterday, there seems to be some conflagration between [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=721.8000000000001s)]
*  Kosovo and Serbia that's kicking up. So all of a sudden, we're [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=724.48s)]
*  talking about a totally different European land war. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=727.2s)]
*  And we have fiscal instability, we're about to talk about it [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=730.48s)]
*  today. But the home market could implode in the United States, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=734.5600000000001s)]
*  the commercial real estate market has already imploded. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=738.2s)]
*  There's all this complexity. And I think that the idea that you [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=741.96s)]
*  can't demand the most important person in the world to be on top [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=746.24s)]
*  of their game. I just think that that's outrageous. You expect [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=752.0s)]
*  the best player in the NBA to be elite. Right? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=755.08s)]
*  Yes, of course. Yes, they have to get good sleep, they have to [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=758.52s)]
*  have good fitness, they're measuring every single dimension [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=761.24s)]
*  of an NBA player's life. They measure their sleep now their [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=764.3199999999999s)]
*  diet, their shooting percentages, everything. And [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=767.16s)]
*  we're not doing that for the president states, by the way, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=771.04s)]
*  the MSNBC host who got the one interview I've seen with Biden [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=772.8s)]
*  in years was Stephanie rule, are you HLE from 11th hour? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=776.36s)]
*  Well, they give them the questions. That's how she gets [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=782.12s)]
*  the interview. Have you seen that like Biden has these cute [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=784.52s)]
*  cards, when he goes with the podium, and literally, it's got [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=787.0s)]
*  the questions and it says who to call on. So they script the [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=789.8s)]
*  whole thing. That's a stack deck. That's a stack deck. But [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=792.48s)]
*  Trump did that as well. If you remember, like, in fairness, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=794.64s)]
*  nobody gave him the questions. I'm saying his set of PR, his [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=798.04s)]
*  set of PR, the McEnany lady, she had a huge binder, and she [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=803.4s)]
*  would flip to the top. My point is, that's okay. We never did [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=807.92s)]
*  the same thing with the same answer. What are you talking [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=810.68s)]
*  about? Didn't you pick the first five speakers? First five [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=812.32s)]
*  questions were people you knew you said that he didn't stack the [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=814.84s)]
*  deck, Jason, come on, stop. We didn't have a script. You pick [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=817.6800000000001s)]
*  the first five speakers, my point is not a press conference. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=821.24s)]
*  That's an introductory event. That's someone announcing. Okay, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=824.0s)]
*  fine. Same thing. You're no, it's not. We're talking about a [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=826.6800000000001s)]
*  White House press conference. Okay, he goes up to the podium. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=831.0s)]
*  And secretly, when they zoom in on the camera, they're seeing [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=835.44s)]
*  that literally, he knows who to call on and what the question is [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=839.08s)]
*  going to be. So in other words, the media is cooperating with [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=842.16s)]
*  the Biden administration for access, for access, and they're [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=846.48s)]
*  giving him the questions. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=850.04s)]
*  All right. Anyway, let's let's move on. I think it's very [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=851.8399999999999s)]
*  important to just acknowledge that you're trying to normalize [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=853.76s)]
*  it by comparing it to a completely different kind of [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=856.16s)]
*  event. I am saying that is something never did that with [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=858.6s)]
*  Trump. They never give Trump the questions. He loves to mix it [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=861.12s)]
*  up. I mean, that's winning. That's how you know he's still [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=864.0799999999999s)]
*  mentally fit. I mean, a mentally unfit Trump would be a scary [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=866.52s)]
*  proposition. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=869.4s)]
*  You may or may not like his personality or temperament, but [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=870.12s)]
*  no one is accusing him of being senile. No, he's sharp. Or [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=873.04s)]
*  having dementia. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=875.84s)]
*  I think it's important to get on the record. I don't think we are [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=876.56s)]
*  saying that he is unfit to be president. I think at least what [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=878.88s)]
*  I'm saying is we have a right to underwrite the president every [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=883.1999999999999s)]
*  four years. And on this dimension, this is the biggest [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=887.76s)]
*  issue that I see with Biden. And I'm concerned in the lack of [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=892.84s)]
*  turnover in the White House. And I want to know that he is [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=899.12s)]
*  actually in charge day to day and making the decisions versus a [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=904.8s)]
*  shadow government. That's all I want to know. And I want to see [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=909.12s)]
*  him live on the debate stage, so that he can validate that he is [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=913.52s)]
*  firmly on the controls. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=919.36s)]
*  100% of Americans want this. The only people who don't want it is [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=920.88s)]
*  people who are in power, who are part of his group. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=923.48s)]
*  That's not 100%. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=927.28s)]
*  I'm talking about Americans who vote, they all want to see him [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=930.68s)]
*  debate. I don't know anybody who doesn't want to see a vibrant [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=933.12s)]
*  debate. So I think this is something the Democratic Party [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=936.04s)]
*  needs to rethink their stance on this. Put them out there, put [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=940.36s)]
*  them on the field, up or down, left or right. He has to debate [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=944.7199999999999s)]
*  at least three, four debates in the primaries, you know, earn [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=948.56s)]
*  his slot. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=951.88s)]
*  It'll do real damage to the Democrats. If Bobby Kennedy gets [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=952.56s)]
*  a ton of steam, and they ignore him, I'll give you a different [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=956.28s)]
*  example of how Bobby's being roadblock, which is when you go [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=959.48s)]
*  to 538.com. And you look at you know, Nate does a great job of [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=962.0799999999999s)]
*  pulling up all of the polling that happens from all of the [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=965.72s)]
*  polling agencies. There are many instances where the Democratic [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=969.76s)]
*  field won't even include him when they ask him questions. And [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=973.76s)]
*  so there is definitely a concerted effort here. And I [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=978.48s)]
*  think it's not that I don't want Joe Biden to win. I think he's, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=981.36s)]
*  he could be fantastic. Again, I voted for him. And I think that [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=984.8000000000001s)]
*  if he's mentally sharp, and his hands are on the [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=988.96s)]
*  What are the chances you think he's sharp, Chema? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=990.96s)]
*  No, I'm saying, I don't know. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=993.08s)]
*  I know. I want to know for myself. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=995.12s)]
*  What do you think the chances are? I don't know. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=996.84s)]
*  I'm just using logic here. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=998.7600000000001s)]
*  I think that could be pretty good, actually. You know, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1000.0s)]
*  there's a lot of like, if you look at Buffett, he's 92. He's [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1001.72s)]
*  sharp as a tack. Munger's 96. He's sharp as a tack. I think [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1004.5600000000001s)]
*  that if you live reasonably well, and Biden's got some great [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1007.4000000000001s)]
*  things working for him, he's been a T total of his whole life. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1010.5200000000001s)]
*  So all the things that would have caught up with you in your [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1013.68s)]
*  80s, Biden has avoided. So from a health perspective, he has the [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1015.68s)]
*  best chance of being on top of his game. Can he be physically [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1019.4399999999999s)]
*  frail? I don't care about that. You know, that happens to [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1022.4s)]
*  everybody. So I think it's important to disambiguate those [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1025.84s)]
*  two. And so it is very easy to tell when you're standing on a [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1029.6399999999999s)]
*  debate stage, hell, you can sit on the debate stage, I don't [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1034.04s)]
*  care. But I want you to be able to explain what you think, in a [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1037.16s)]
*  way that's cogent and coherent. And you walk away thinking, I [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1041.96s)]
*  feel safer with him with his hands on the controls here. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1046.16s)]
*  Sax, what do you think? Is he? What do you think the chances [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1048.88s)]
*  are he's sharp as a tack? He's not in cognitive decline? He's [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1051.16s)]
*  not a biased opinion. We know that. The question is whether he [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1055.24s)]
*  can serve at all. Should people have to take a cognitive test? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1059.92s)]
*  Do you think that would be a good improvement? Look, I think [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1063.2s)]
*  the debates the cognitive test. But let me ask the Senate and [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1064.88s)]
*  stuff like that, because it does seem like people are the voters [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1067.8s)]
*  are the cognitive test. Okay, the problem is when the media is [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1070.36s)]
*  cooperating with the candidate by not asking them tough [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1074.6799999999998s)]
*  questions, or even worse sharing the questions with them, to give [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1077.3999999999999s)]
*  voters a false impression of how strong they are. I mean, look, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1080.32s)]
*  the media's job is to be fundamentally antagonistic with [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1084.28s)]
*  the people in power not to cooperate with them. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1087.3999999999999s)]
*  Here's something super intriguing that happened this [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1089.6s)]
*  week. Jamie Dimon has hinted at running for office. Bill Ackman [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1092.1599999999999s)]
*  made a case for him to run for president in 2024. This is [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1097.3200000000002s)]
*  getting a lot of steam. All of a sudden people are talking about [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1101.3200000000002s)]
*  it on CNBC. And it's trending on Twitter. On Wednesday, JP Morgan [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1103.44s)]
*  Chase CEO Jamie Dimon made some comments about potentially [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1108.1200000000001s)]
*  running for office in the future quote, I love my country. And [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1111.1200000000001s)]
*  maybe one day I'll serve my country in one capacity or [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1114.76s)]
*  another. He's 67 years old. He didn't know that Bill Ackman [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1117.92s)]
*  tweeted his support for diamond running as a Dem against Biden. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1122.48s)]
*  Ackman put out a number of compelling points. Diamond is [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1127.48s)]
*  one of the world's most respected business leaders. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1130.64s)]
*  That's true. politically centrist pro business pro free [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1132.3600000000001s)]
*  enterprise. All true. supportive of well designed social [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1135.52s)]
*  programs and rational tax policies that can help the less [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1138.28s)]
*  fortunate smart, thoughtful, pragmatic knows how to bring [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1140.72s)]
*  opposing parties together are highly respected by right, left [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1143.52s)]
*  and center. I think that's also true. superbly managed JP Morgan [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1146.5600000000002s)]
*  through every crisis. Quote, no bullshit straight talking [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1150.48s)]
*  charismatic leader with an enormous grasp of the world's [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1154.92s)]
*  issues and how to address them. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1158.4s)]
*  Trimoth, I'll just ask it to you plainly. If you had three [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1161.8400000000001s)]
*  choices or four choices, Trump, to Santas, Biden, and the Jedi, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1164.52s)]
*  Jamie Dimon stack rank those for us rank them. What do you got? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1171.04s)]
*  Who do you vote for? Those are your four choices? Probably [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1175.04s)]
*  Jamie Dimon one. Okay. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1179.3999999999999s)]
*  Santas two. Okay. And Trump and Biden, it's a bit of a tie. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1183.04s)]
*  Bit of a tie. garbage, garbage. Okay. Not garbage, garbage. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1189.44s)]
*  Don't don't say that. But it's a bit of a tie. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1192.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's two people that nobody wants to vote for it [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1194.8s)]
*  seems wants to run. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1197.36s)]
*  I personally believe that the era of septuagenarians and [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1198.6399999999999s)]
*  octogenarians should come to an end in terms of their ability [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1202.56s)]
*  to run this country. I want that transition. Now, Jamie is [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1206.08s)]
*  67. So but he's still much younger than these two other [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1209.3999999999999s)]
*  guys. And again, I go back to yours is a lot. It's a lot of [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1213.32s)]
*  vitality, energy. This matters. And I think that he is a very [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1216.3999999999999s)]
*  competent, economic, rational actor. So it would be [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1223.0s)]
*  interesting to see. I mean, look, the reality is, if I had [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1227.72s)]
*  to be really honest with you, I think that what we should do is [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1230.6s)]
*  keep chipping away at the establishment and how they pick [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1232.96s)]
*  candidates, it's going to be a slow process. But I think in 10 [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1236.76s)]
*  or 15 years, the real thing that we should all do is if there's [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1241.4s)]
*  enough citizen journalism, that we should really just change the [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1244.32s)]
*  Constitution, so that we can allow people that have been here [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1247.8400000000001s)]
*  for 25 plus years that have paid all their taxes that have [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1252.76s)]
*  followed all the rules to run for president. And then we could [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1255.48s)]
*  actually just we could vote Ilan in and just have him clean it up [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1259.3600000000001s)]
*  the way he's cleaning up everything else. Honestly, why [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1262.16s)]
*  not just do that? I mean, who would who would not want that? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1265.96s)]
*  Sax, let me ask you to stack rank and then we'll get to the [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1269.44s)]
*  change in the Constitution issue, which is out as a hell [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1273.44s)]
*  mary. How would you rank those four? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1276.5600000000002s)]
*  I think that we have run out of topics to talk about if Bill [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1279.1200000000001s)]
*  Ackman's latest political brain fart is a major topic of [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1284.64s)]
*  conversation. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1288.64s)]
*  I think this is inspired. You guys put Trump in office, the [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1291.2800000000002s)]
*  GOP put Trump in office. He's the outsider is outsider [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1294.0400000000002s)]
*  lunatic. And you can't even consider Jamie. You're laughing [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1296.88s)]
*  at that and you put Trump in office, you guys put Trump in [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1301.8400000000001s)]
*  office. And you're gonna do it again. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1304.3600000000001s)]
*  You mean you guys listen, that GOP party. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1306.24s)]
*  Here's the part about this conversation that sort of makes [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1309.72s)]
*  sense. Two thirds of the country says that they are uninspired and [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1312.0400000000002s)]
*  in fact fatigued by the idea of having a repeat of the same [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1315.48s)]
*  choice that four years ago, everybody wants a different [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1318.8s)]
*  choice. So I get this like fantasy basketball drafting [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1321.04s)]
*  thing that we're trying to do here. Okay. The reason why I [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1326.3600000000001s)]
*  call it a brain fart, and I look, Bill's a really smart guy, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1330.44s)]
*  I'm not dragging him. But in order to win the presidency, you [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1333.48s)]
*  have to get the nomination of a major party. And the problem [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1336.8s)]
*  with all this like fantasy drafting is that you're trying [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1339.52s)]
*  to draft people who are anathema to the party that [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1342.0s)]
*  you're trying to get them the nomination from. And Trump was [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1346.72s)]
*  able to get the nomination the Republican Party, Jamie, I would [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1350.96s)]
*  have to get the nomination the Democratic Party, that's not [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1355.08s)]
*  going to happen. And it does remind me of Bloomberg. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1357.12s)]
*  Remember, Bloomberg spent $100 million on his campaign late. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1359.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1362.6s)]
*  He spent a lot of money and he made it to the first question of [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1363.68s)]
*  the first debate. Remember what happened? Elizabeth Warren said [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1366.92s)]
*  that this is a billionaire who talks about he didn't fight, he [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1370.12s)]
*  lay down, he rolled over, she like ended him with one question, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1374.9199999999998s)]
*  one debate. So my point is that you got to be able to get the [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1378.28s)]
*  nomination of a major party. And actually, I think neither party [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1381.76s)]
*  could nominate a banker right now. I mean, if you saw what [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1385.08s)]
*  happened around the whole banking crisis, that I think [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1387.84s)]
*  still going on in slow motion. I mean, the amount of animosity [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1391.84s)]
*  both towards the banks that went under and the idea of, you [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1395.68s)]
*  know, potentially bailing them out. And then also the animosity [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1400.76s)]
*  towards JP Morgan when it actually bought First Republic. I [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1403.52s)]
*  mean, both parties have such a strong populist wing in them [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1408.92s)]
*  right now that I think you could never get. Yeah, the head of the [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1412.48s)]
*  number one bank in the US to be their candidate. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1416.48s)]
*  You're completely wrong. I think in this case, respectfully. I [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1418.72s)]
*  mean, he could run as an independent as well. And although [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1422.2s)]
*  you know, you like to think or it seems like you're proposing [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1426.64s)]
*  that things are going to be as they always were. Trump shows a [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1430.16s)]
*  wild card and then people forget Ross Perot, you know, he got 19% [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1433.04s)]
*  of the popular vote. He hit 20 million votes to Bush's 40 [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1437.72s)]
*  million and Clinton's 44. It is not unprecedented. And we are in [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1442.52s)]
*  a really struggling time. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1446.2s)]
*  You started this off by saying the Democrats should draft Jamie [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1447.72s)]
*  Diamond. Now you're saying that I'm fine if you're saying [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1450.44s)]
*  independent. I don't know. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1452.92s)]
*  Why would he run as an independent? There's no movement [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1454.1200000000001s)]
*  to draft the top banker in the country. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1456.8400000000001s)]
*  Like, where do you see this? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1461.28s)]
*  Brown's reality star like Trump in Okay, that was the wild card [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1462.28s)]
*  of all wild cards. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1465.44s)]
*  He ran in one of the two major parties and he hit a nerve. I [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1466.3600000000001s)]
*  know that's my point. So that's what you got to tell me about [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1470.52s)]
*  Ross Perot. Tell me about Ross Perot. And how did he hit 20 [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1472.8400000000001s)]
*  million votes? And isn't the world much different right now [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1475.76s)]
*  because of media because of people going direct? We're [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1478.16s)]
*  talking I mean, Shemoff just proposed Elon. If you're [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1480.5600000000002s)]
*  proposing Elon, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1483.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm proposing a constitutional amendment so that competent [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1485.1200000000001s)]
*  people [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1487.64s)]
*  sure who are not born in the country. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1488.6000000000001s)]
*  Now, if you've lived here for 25 years or 30 years, you've [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1491.28s)]
*  created hundreds of 1000s of jobs and paid 10s of billions of [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1493.88s)]
*  taxes. The idea that you are less fit than half these [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1497.4s)]
*  politicians to run for president is insane. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1501.48s)]
*  Okay, that well, that's a different question. What do you [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1504.3200000000002s)]
*  think about that? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1505.68s)]
*  Do you think we should change the Constitution allow non [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1507.3600000000001s)]
*  nationals to run for president? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1510.3200000000002s)]
*  Not don't stop saying non nationals. It's gross. It's like, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1512.3600000000001s)]
*  well, you know, it's people that weren't necessarily born here. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1515.2800000000002s)]
*  But if you've lived your whole life, you're the majority of [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1518.2s)]
*  your life, and you've built value for America and helped it [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1520.3600000000001s)]
*  win. All of a sudden, you're less capable of being president. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1523.2800000000002s)]
*  That's absolutely not true. Oh, I didn't say it was I'm I'm [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1526.3600000000001s)]
*  describing what the Constitution says. So this was not born [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1529.8400000000001s)]
*  called the Schwarzenegger Amendment. Because you know, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1532.48s)]
*  when he was governor of California, there are people who [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1535.56s)]
*  wanted him to run for president. But look, it's too hard to [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1537.6399999999999s)]
*  change the Constitution. It's a very difficult process. So do I [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1540.12s)]
*  think that's going to happen? No. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1543.6399999999999s)]
*  Would you be in favor of that? And under what circumstances? Do [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1545.8s)]
*  you think that it's about saying we should change that? He's [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1549.28s)]
*  emphatic, we should change it in fact. So what do you think? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1551.72s)]
*  It's not a pressing issue for me. I'd rather have a balanced [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1554.12s)]
*  budget amendment. I'd rather the president have a line item veto [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1556.56s)]
*  to control spending. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1560.32s)]
*  If you want to blow up the government, and cut it down to [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1561.32s)]
*  size, and impose the ideals of liberalism, true liberalism, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1564.56s)]
*  free speech, well controlled borders, but good immigration, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1569.04s)]
*  etc, etc. I feel like there are lots of people who could do that. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1572.84s)]
*  And the only difference is, they were accidentally not born here, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1580.96s)]
*  except they've created more value in America than most [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1584.52s)]
*  Americans that were born here. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1588.04s)]
*  That's true. It would actually be foreign born national would be [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1589.44s)]
*  the most accurate term. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1591.8799999999999s)]
*  Great. Whatever dumb term, whatever dumb term you want to [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1593.32s)]
*  use. I'm just using the ones in the Constitution, the government [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1596.8s)]
*  uses. Sorry, Chamath, for using accurate terms. I'll try to use [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1598.96s)]
*  less accurate terms in the future. So back to Jamie, Diamond. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1602.16s)]
*  Nobody here is questioning whether he is a supremely competent [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1608.56s)]
*  executive. Fully grant that he's done an amazing job. Taking JP [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1612.76s)]
*  Morgan, it was already the biggest, he's made it even [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1617.96s)]
*  bigger. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1619.8400000000001s)]
*  How is that possible? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1620.64s)]
*  In the face of them saying we got to stop the banks from getting [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1622.24s)]
*  bigger. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1624.56s)]
*  Yeah, whether that's a good thing for the country ultimately [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1626.32s)]
*  is a different question. No one questions his competence and his [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1628.24s)]
*  expertise. But again, I see no groundswell for him in either [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1631.32s)]
*  the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, or even as an [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1634.8799999999999s)]
*  independent because again, it doesn't fit the populist mood of [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1637.6799999999998s)]
*  the country right now. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1641.24s)]
*  Got it. So that's your pragmatic path to victory. But let me ask [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1642.44s)]
*  you about competence then because maybe I could frame the [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1648.6799999999998s)]
*  question and get a better answer out of you. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1650.4s)]
*  That's what I thought I was answering when you said who'd be [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1652.0400000000002s)]
*  a more competent president. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1654.1200000000001s)]
*  You guys interpret my questions. How have you like you interpret [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1655.48s)]
*  it in terms of competence? Saks interpreted the question [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1657.72s)]
*  pragmatically to getting into office. But let's ask Saks the [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1660.88s)]
*  question and I'll ask you pragmatically and let's ask the [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1664.0s)]
*  question of competence. In terms of competence, I gave you like [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1666.64s)]
*  four people, right? Is he the most competent person to run the [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1670.8000000000002s)]
*  country right now? No, I you think DeSantis is more competent [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1673.44s)]
*  than him? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1676.3600000000001s)]
*  I think that of all the major candidates who actually have a [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1676.88s)]
*  realistic shot, DeSantis is the most supremely competent as an [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1679.64s)]
*  executive. He's run the state of Florida. He did it during COVID [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1683.2800000000002s)]
*  which was a major crisis. We all saw what happened all of our [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1686.96s)]
*  friends were leaving California because California had lockdown [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1691.0s)]
*  schools were closed. We had the worst learning loss of any state [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1695.76s)]
*  small businesses were going under our toddlers had to wear [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1699.0800000000002s)]
*  these stupid pointless cloth masks to school. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1702.4s)]
*  But you were including Jamie in that group. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1704.72s)]
*  Hold on. So DeSantis kept Florida open. They had a great economy. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1706.52s)]
*  It's number one in job creation investment, people moving there [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1712.76s)]
*  heard the speech, he balanced the budget. And that's why he was [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1716.1200000000001s)]
*  able to grow his majority from under 1% when he first got [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1718.16s)]
*  elected to 20 points. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1721.28s)]
*  So you believe he would be more qualified than Jamie Diamond? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1722.8s)]
*  Yeah, because he's actually been tested in a political realm. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1726.4s)]
*  Got it. So you think that is the better test? I disagree. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1732.16s)]
*  And I think probably the number one thing you have to do to be [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1735.36s)]
*  effective politically is to be able to understand when the [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1738.2s)]
*  media the mainstream media and all their fake experts are [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1741.92s)]
*  wrong. Because that's why the country is such a mess. We keep [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1744.44s)]
*  listening to all these fake experts who are wrong about [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1747.52s)]
*  everything, including COVID. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1749.76s)]
*  Did Trump do a good job as president in your mind? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1751.44s)]
*  He listened to the fake experts. He had Fauci in there. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1753.24s)]
*  So you don't think Trump did a good job as president? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1756.08s)]
*  On COVID? He listened to Fauci too much. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1758.08s)]
*  But okay, because Trump was an outsider, and you seem to think [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1760.16s)]
*  he did a good job as president, and a lot of Republicans do. So [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1762.44s)]
*  that's my point. He was an outsider. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1764.68s)]
*  You love putting words in my mouth and characterizing [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1766.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm not. I'm asking you to do a good job right now. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1768.6000000000001s)]
*  In ways that I never quite said. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1771.0s)]
*  Okay, I'm just asking you. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1772.28s)]
*  I think I think that Trump did a number of good things in [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1773.0s)]
*  office, for example, he kept us out of foreign wars. And I think [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1776.0800000000002s)]
*  the economy was pretty good until COVID. But [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1779.64s)]
*  Yeah, he had no political experience. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1783.24s)]
*  I would say there were like two big Achilles heels. One was, we [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1785.28s)]
*  had huge deficits and debt during Trump. And the other was, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1788.8s)]
*  once COVID happened, he listened to Fauci. And Fauci was driving [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1792.56s)]
*  the train during COVID. And hold on, gave us the lockdowns. And [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1796.32s)]
*  then Trump never fired Fauci. And on Trump's last day in office, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1800.44s)]
*  He gave him a medal. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1804.52s)]
*  He gave him a f**king medal. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1805.04s)]
*  Insane. Insane. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1808.16s)]
*  And just so everybody remembers, June 16, 2015, Ben Carson and [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1810.68s)]
*  businessman Donald Trump tied in fourth place with 5%. So things [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1814.72s)]
*  can change. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1818.6s)]
*  And now Trump is swinging wildly at DeSantis saying that DeSantis [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1819.4s)]
*  was worse than Cuomo on COVID. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1822.88s)]
*  Oh, God, I really do not want to relitigate that. That's the last [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1826.0800000000002s)]
*  thing I want to relitigate is COVID. Man, we got bigger fish [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1828.8000000000002s)]
*  to fry. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1831.2s)]
*  DeSantis, I think, has been doing really well over the last [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1831.6000000000001s)]
*  week, because Trump has been making all these wild attacks on [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1833.76s)]
*  him. And DeSantis has been responding. So now, like they're [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1836.48s)]
*  really punching at each other. It's really interesting. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1841.48s)]
*  Let's pivot to the debt ceiling real quick here. The House voted [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1843.68s)]
*  overwhelmingly to pass the debt ceiling agreement 314 to 117. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1845.68s)]
*  It's in the hands of the Senate. It could be passed by the time [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1850.76s)]
*  you're listening to this. Some Republicans think the spending [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1853.28s)]
*  didn't go far enough. No shocker there. But Speaker McCarthy [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1856.48s)]
*  called it a first step. Projected the bill would reduce [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1859.88s)]
*  budget deficits by 1.5 trillion over the next decade. Some [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1863.1200000000001s)]

*  There you have it. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1950.8s)]
*  Go to that the red chart. This is our national debt. This is a [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1951.32s)]
*  upside down hockey stick. So this is what's concerning about [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1954.96s)]
*  it is we're going to exponential on this thing. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1958.24s)]
*  The problem with this, just to reframe it once again, for the [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1961.24s)]
*  100,000th time, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1965.48s)]
*  wait a sec, wait, this red chart isn't this freeburg's losses in [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1966.76s)]
*  Vegas this weekend? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1969.28s)]
*  I think that's part Oh, no, that's our collective losses in [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1971.76s)]
*  Vegas. This week. I think we did the math. This group was [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1974.16s)]
*  accounted for 10 vips 10 vips of Vegas is blackjack revenue for [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1977.52s)]
*  the year. So good job, everyone. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1981.92s)]
*  Good job. People. Everybody in Vegas is now completed their q [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1984.0s)]
*  three quarter targets early. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1988.04s)]
*  So the problem obviously with mounting debt is the interest [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1990.48s)]
*  payments on the debt cause you to take out more debt. And [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1995.0s)]
*  there's a tipping point where it becomes insurmountable. And [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=1997.72s)]
*  there are many people sounding the alarm that we may be [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2001.5600000000002s)]
*  entering that point that in order to fund the interest [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2004.44s)]
*  obligations on the debt, we need to take out more debt. And then [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2006.88s)]
*  there's more interest payments, and therefore there's more debt, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2011.04s)]
*  and it just keeps getting bigger and bigger. And so this chart I'm [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2013.2s)]
*  sharing here is actually from the federal government's GAO, the [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2016.6399999999999s)]
*  government accountability office, which acts almost like [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2021.1599999999999s)]
*  an independent accounting and forecasting body, trying to [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2024.1599999999999s)]
*  provide some outlook on the fiscal condition of the federal [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2026.72s)]
*  government. And this is an analysis I think they put out a [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2030.36s)]
*  few weeks ago, showing that as of the fiscal year 22, 8% of the [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2033.8799999999999s)]
*  overall federal budget was going towards interest spending by [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2040.2s)]
*  fiscal year 25, it'll be 26%. And then net interest spending [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2043.68s)]
*  will need to grow to half of the budget. But if you go to the [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2048.64s)]
*  other [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2051.64s)]
*  sorry, why don't you say that? Why don't you say the years? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2052.0s)]
*  Because it's important to know what years you're talking about [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2054.28s)]
*  2051 2096 is what they're showing. This is a long window. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2057.16s)]
*  Yeah, I get it. But let me show you this chart. Just pull up the [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2061.7200000000003s)]
*  first chart. So this is our federal government's interest [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2064.16s)]
*  payments per year. And so this is how much the government pays [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2066.92s)]
*  on interest for the debt, by the way, most of the debt is getting [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2071.0s)]
*  refinanced now at the higher interest rates, because a lot of [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2074.08s)]
*  this debt was sitting in Zerp era since 2008. But as the debt [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2076.8s)]
*  has to get refinanced, and more debt is taken on to fund the [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2082.92s)]
*  interest payment obligations, the interest payment actually [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2086.64s)]
*  starts to mount more significantly. And that's what [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2088.8s)]
*  we've seen in the last two fiscal years in particular. Now [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2091.04s)]
*  when you take this chart, and you overlay how much we spend on [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2094.68s)]
*  defense, so here's defense spending, we are, I think as of [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2097.96s)]
*  this month or last month now spending more, the federal [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2103.44s)]
*  government is spending more on interest payments on the federal [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2106.7599999999998s)]
*  debt than they are on national defense. Whether we believe we [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2110.08s)]
*  are spending money on national defense in a smart way or in an [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2113.7999999999997s)]
*  accountable way, or whether these are good strategic [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2116.96s)]
*  priorities and good strategic decisions, the fact remains that [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2119.0s)]
*  at some point here, our ability to actually fund the programs [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2122.68s)]
*  that we want to fund, whether they're social security, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2126.2799999999997s)]
*  Medicare or defense, the major cost outlays for the federal [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2128.56s)]
*  government, it's going to get further hindered, and continually [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2132.08s)]
*  more hindered by the fact that these interest payments are [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2135.72s)]
*  climbing so significantly. If you go to the third chart, I [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2137.8799999999997s)]
*  think it kind of provides the final point, which is social [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2140.56s)]
*  security. And we're very quickly seeing interest payments mount [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2143.48s)]
*  to the point of where social security spending lays. And when [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2147.3599999999997s)]
*  that happens, obviously, as you guys know, everyone talks about [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2151.36s)]
*  that as being the golden program, the right and the left, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2154.1600000000003s)]
*  the Democrats and the Republicans simply will not touch [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2156.84s)]
*  social security from a policy perspective from a getting [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2159.48s)]
*  elected perspective. But the economic and arithmetic reality [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2163.1600000000003s)]
*  is running up against them, which is that the interest [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2167.36s)]
*  payments on the debt are starting to threaten our ability [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2169.6800000000003s)]
*  to fund social security and Medicare. There's many more [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2173.2000000000003s)]
*  charts we could pull up to highlight this, the Republicans [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2176.48s)]
*  announcing the debt deal this week, made a lot of proclamations [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2179.32s)]
*  about it being a win and showed how we were able to reduce [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2183.96s)]
*  spending by $2 trillion. I think the statement they made the deal [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2186.36s)]
*  cuts $2.1 trillion in spending over the six year life of the [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2191.28s)]
*  bill and one and a half trillion dollars in statutorily mandated [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2194.92s)]
*  savings over the next two years, $2.1 trillion over six years. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2197.36s)]
*  Remember, we're talking about a $7 million, $7 trillion per year [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2201.76s)]
*  budget. So that's $42 trillion over those six years, we're [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2205.96s)]
*  cutting 2 trillion of 42. So it's a 5% impact to start. It's a [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2209.76s)]
*  start. But what leverage do they have now? And I think that [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2214.96s)]
*  isn't consensus freeburg that they actually did decide to make [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2218.8s)]
*  cuts. And that feels to me, and we did predict here that they [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2222.84s)]
*  would get this done. Does feel to me like this is some amount of [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2225.4s)]
*  progress, right? I mean, do you feel good about it or in [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2228.48s)]
*  different? Friedberg? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2231.2400000000002s)]
*  I think you guys know, I think that there's, we have we have to [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2233.4s)]
*  tackle the the structural problem of revenue, spending, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2237.12s)]
*  interest rates. Those are like, very big numbers that are [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2242.4s)]
*  challenging each other, chipping away at the spending doesn't [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2248.2000000000003s)]
*  quite get us there. And, you know, it doesn't seem like [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2252.28s)]
*  there's a clear path here. Even you know, the argument that RFK [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2256.56s)]
*  made when he came on our show, or if KJ made when he came on our [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2259.7200000000003s)]
*  show, that cutting military spending would have an impact. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2262.32s)]
*  I mean, you guys see, military spending is already starting to [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2265.04s)]
*  get overtaken by the interest payment spending. So does that [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2267.8s)]
*  really move the needle? I think it's going to be an economic [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2272.6400000000003s)]
*  reality that all programs are going to need to be cut back in [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2275.1600000000003s)]
*  order to fund the debt obligations, or we're going to [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2278.6000000000004s)]
*  see massive inflation. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2281.6800000000003s)]
*  My question was, do you feel like this was a good step or a [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2284.6000000000004s)]
*  good signal that maybe the government is and our [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2288.44s)]
*  representatives are getting the message that they need to make [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2293.04s)]
*  some cuts at some point? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2295.68s)]
*  I don't think that there's any way to provide the necessary [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2297.0s)]
*  fiscal security for the federal government without bipartisan [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2302.2000000000003s)]
*  unitary support around the objective, which is to get to a [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2307.28s)]
*  balanced budget and to reduce the overall debt and interest [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2311.28s)]
*  payment obligations. And if you can't start from that point, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2314.2000000000003s)]
*  it's this push and pull over what programs get cut, but I [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2318.44s)]
*  want more money being spent. I want to have a pipeline. I want [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2321.08s)]
*  to have this whole that's super enthused by this. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2323.84s)]
*  I thought it was a positive step. Chamath, you have talked [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2325.56s)]
*  about refinancing the debt, putting the hundred year [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2328.6s)]
*  trillion dollar coin or whatever, we wind up doing [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2331.28s)]
*  refinancing this on a long arc, 50 year 100 year arc. What does [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2333.7200000000003s)]
*  this debt ceiling reconciliation or whatever we're going to call [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2338.84s)]
*  it, that they came to some sort of agreement here signal to you, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2343.08s)]
*  you predicted they would get through this pretty easily. So [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2346.96s)]
*  yeah. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2349.2400000000002s)]
*  Boring, nothing burger, nothing move on. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2350.6800000000003s)]
*  Nothing to see. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2353.44s)]
*  Satchel, would you buy 100 year bond from the federal government? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2354.36s)]
*  If I was a foreign government? Yes. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2359.44s)]
*  What interest would you need to get paid on that? To take that [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2361.48s)]
*  on? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2364.6400000000003s)]
*  Probably one to 2% [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2365.76s)]
*  one to 2% for 100 years. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2367.76s)]
*  Yeah, so it would be downside protection. You just feel like [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2369.4s)]
*  this is a secure place to put some amount of money. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2371.76s)]
*  This is how any any country with a turbulent currency would make [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2375.2s)]
*  this decision and you could actually get close to zero. I [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2382.12s)]
*  think that when we had ZERP, you probably could have charged a [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2385.72s)]
*  negative interest rate, because you would have effectively been [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2388.2799999999997s)]
*  charging countries, third world developing countries, even [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2391.0s)]
*  first world countries that just wanted a protective mechanism [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2394.2799999999997s)]
*  against their currency volatility, they would have [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2397.16s)]
*  probably paid you just like today, you can get BoJ debt. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2399.3199999999997s)]
*  That's negative yielding. So it's no longer negative, but it's [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2402.84s)]
*  still probably in the realm of one, one and a half percent. It's [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2405.6000000000004s)]
*  nothing if you just do the math, it's nothing. And this is why I [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2408.84s)]
*  don't understand why everybody just gets their underwear in a [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2411.84s)]
*  bunch here. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2414.52s)]
*  Okay, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2414.96s)]
*  non gender underpants, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2415.56s)]
*  put the red chart up there. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2417.2400000000002s)]
*  It's nothing. It's a nothing. It's a nothing. It's a nothing. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2419.8s)]
*  It's a nothing. It's a hockey stick. Nothing means nothing. I [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2423.76s)]
*  think you guys see here is an accelerating problem. Yeah, cut [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2426.92s)]
*  revenue. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2430.76s)]
*  The debt is getting bigger and bigger at the same time that [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2431.28s)]
*  foreign governments and investors in general don't want [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2434.88s)]
*  to fund our debt. So therefore interest rates will rise our [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2437.6400000000003s)]
*  interest costs will keep going. That's not why interest rates [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2440.76s)]
*  are going up. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2442.8s)]
*  Well, if they're going up, because the Fed is raising [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2444.2000000000003s)]
*  rates, because of inflation, but at the same time, that's [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2445.8s)]
*  happening, foreign governments are not as interested in having [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2448.1600000000003s)]
*  dollar reserves and US treasuries [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2451.92s)]
*  said who does demonstrated by what [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2454.32s)]
*  you look at the foreign reserves of these countries with these [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2457.08s)]
*  sovereigns, they are much less interested in holding US [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2460.12s)]
*  treasuries for China, starting with China and all the BRICS [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2462.48s)]
*  countries, foreign reserves are up. These guys are banking US [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2465.64s)]
*  dollars like nobody's business. I don't think so. I think it's [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2469.24s)]
*  been going down since 2008. I'll find you a chart. Yeah, maybe [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2471.68s)]
*  from 2008. I don't know from the great financial crisis at the [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2475.12s)]
*  absolute depths. But what I'm saying is that in general, the [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2478.3199999999997s)]
*  anchor currency for BRICS is going to be the US dollar. And [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2482.48s)]
*  the anchor currency for governments and central banks [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2486.0s)]
*  has been will be and will likely be in the future, the United [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2488.24s)]
*  States dollar. And we get back to the circular argument, which [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2493.44s)]
*  is, I don't think it's possible for politicians to cut [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2496.56s)]
*  expenses. So I am just an advocate for cutting revenue, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2500.04s)]
*  because I do think it's the simplest way to force people, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2504.12s)]
*  because the next time they go through these machinations and [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2507.64s)]

*  revenue to play with. And it'll just become a harder and harder [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2514.32s)]
*  and harder problem. Meanwhile, I do think that you have to take [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2516.6800000000003s)]
*  the ball where it lies and take these 24 or $30 trillion and [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2520.36s)]
*  refinance it well out into the future and make a bet on US [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2524.1200000000003s)]
*  exceptionalism and US GDP. And if you don't want to believe it, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2528.1200000000003s)]
*  don't fucking be here. Move to some other country where you [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2530.96s)]
*  think it's so much better and go do it there. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2533.6000000000004s)]
*  But what if the markets not there? What if the buyers are [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2535.36s)]
*  not there and you're wrong? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2538.0800000000004s)]
*  Sure. I mean, you know, an asteroid could hit the earth in [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2539.6400000000003s)]
*  the next day, we could talk about all kinds of long tail [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2542.88s)]
*  consequences. But there is there you have to be able to [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2545.2400000000002s)]
*  probably wait these things and then spend your time thinking [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2548.2000000000003s)]
*  about the things that are more probabilistic, and be able to [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2551.48s)]
*  compartmentalize the anxiety of the less probabilistic things. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2554.36s)]
*  So I think that could there be a scenario where there is no [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2558.0s)]
*  interest? Sure. Is there one? No, because you see every day the [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2562.44s)]
*  governments in the market doing auctions, and there is a robust [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2565.44s)]
*  demand for United States government debt. And until there [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2568.8s)]
*  isn't this argument is specious. And all I would tell [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2572.4s)]
*  you is just keep trying, put out more try a 45 euro bond and see [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2576.04s)]
*  how it feels like try a 50 year, you don't have to do 100 if it [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2580.84s)]
*  makes you too anxious. That's fine. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2583.76s)]
*  Let me just ask you at some point, if the market isn't [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2585.28s)]
*  there, the buyers are not there. Then you know, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2587.08s)]
*  but let's just go through the analysis because I know that you [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2591.1600000000003s)]
*  think it's it's a zero chance. But if it's as low probability, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2593.4s)]
*  do you agree that the severity is high, that the significance [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2596.7200000000003s)]
*  of that being the case? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2600.12s)]
*  Again, I am not going to give an iota of breath to a long tail [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2601.4s)]
*  five sigma outcome. It is a waste of time. Okay, because it [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2606.08s)]
*  occupies and I'll tell you why I don't do it. It occupies my [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2610.52s)]
*  mindshare, which takes away from me figuring out how to make money [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2613.6s)]
*  and win on the field today. So I have, you know, I wake in a 24 [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2617.28s)]
*  hour day, okay, just to give you a sense of it, I sleep for eight, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2622.08s)]
*  you know, I'm eating for another one or two, all this bullshit, I [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2625.56s)]
*  have four or five hours a day of useful thinking time. And I try [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2629.04s)]
*  to think of the belly of the probable. And I try to [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2634.44s)]
*  compartmentalize these dumb long tail sigma events, because it [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2639.12s)]
*  distracts me from making money and winning. I actually try to [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2642.96s)]
*  think about long tail sigma events that could make me money. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2646.56s)]
*  This isn't one of them. So I just don't spend time thinking [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2650.2799999999997s)]
*  about it. I could be totally wrong. Totally wrong. But it's [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2653.8s)]
*  worked for me so far. And I'm going to stick to what works. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2657.64s)]
*  Guys, sax has been on Google for five minutes. He's got something [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2660.2s)]
*  for you tomorrow. Go ahead. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2662.56s)]
*  You should stick to the investing strategy that works for [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2663.48s)]
*  you. I'd like to talk about the status of US treasuries. So if [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2665.72s)]
*  you look here, this is total foreign treasury holdings as [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2671.3199999999997s)]
*  percent of marketable Treasury security. So it's gone down from [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2674.52s)]
*  the mid 50s to the low 30s since 2008 2009, as a percentage. So [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2677.56s)]
*  foreign governments, foreign governments don't want our [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2684.4s)]
*  treasuries as much as they used to starting with China, they are [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2687.32s)]
*  diversifying into other currencies and gold. And there [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2690.32s)]
*  are a bunch of good reasons for that. By the way, this comes [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2694.96s)]
*  from a blog, which is really interesting. It's a crypto guy [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2697.0800000000004s)]
*  named Arthur Hayes. And this is actually a pretty interesting [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2700.44s)]
*  piece called exit liquidity. Hayes writes interesting pieces [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2703.7200000000003s)]
*  on the banking system and de dollarization. He's got a little [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2706.88s)]
*  bit of a Dumer thesis with respect to the US dollar. You [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2710.2000000000003s)]
*  know, obviously, he's pro Bitcoin, his views are sort of [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2713.0800000000004s)]
*  similar to biologies. But anyway, I think one of the [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2716.24s)]
*  points he makes that's really interesting is that if you're to [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2718.8399999999997s)]
*  zoom out 30,000 feet, and think about the regime that we had [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2721.8799999999997s)]
*  during let's call it the unipolar moment where China and [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2726.9199999999996s)]
*  the United States were strong trading partners, and we had [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2730.4799999999996s)]
*  this close relationship with them. The way the global [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2734.3599999999997s)]
*  economy worked is that China would sell goods to the United [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2737.08s)]
*  States, they would have huge trade surpluses. And then they [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2741.24s)]
*  would take those dollars, and they'd use some of them to buy [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2744.88s)]
*  raw materials like energy that was called the petrodollar. And [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2747.88s)]
*  then they would take other dollars their surplus and instead [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2751.7200000000003s)]
*  of repatriating at home, they would have to have then [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2755.76s)]
*  converted that money into RMB and brought it home. They didn't [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2758.48s)]
*  do that that actually would have increased the value of their [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2761.2000000000003s)]
*  currency thereby making their exports less attractive. This is [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2763.32s)]
*  why they're accused of currency manipulation. They took their [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2766.2400000000002s)]
*  surplus dollars and bought us assets, mainly us treasuries. So [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2769.04s)]
*  we had this trading relationship with China, I think everyone [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2774.56s)]
*  understands the physical world side of that trading [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2777.08s)]
*  relationship where you had us manufacturing jobs got exports [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2779.36s)]
*  to China, they basically made everything a lot of cheap goods [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2782.2799999999997s)]
*  came into the US data trade surplus. What I think people [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2784.88s)]
*  don't understand is that a huge part of that trade surplus was [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2787.7999999999997s)]
*  used to finance us deficits and debt. And so you had this like [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2790.96s)]
*  cozy relationship between us, elites, us politicians and China, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2795.7599999999998s)]
*  where they got to rack up these huge deficits, the government got [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2801.24s)]
*  to spend a lot of money. And China would fund it very cheaply. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2803.68s)]
*  But now that's all ended that stopped because we're basically [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2807.72s)]
*  starting to decouple from China. So China doesn't want to do its [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2810.7599999999998s)]
*  business and dollars if they don't have to, obviously, for the [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2814.7599999999998s)]
*  products they sell at the US, they'll take dollars, but they're [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2817.52s)]
*  already trying to do as many transactions as they can, buying [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2820.64s)]
*  oil, for example, or energy in RMB. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2825.24s)]
*  I don't want to dispute this chart because this chart is true. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2828.2s)]
*  But it's a small part of how the entire puzzle works. And so [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2831.8s)]
*  this is a Bitcoin maximalist, who cherry picks a few data [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2834.92s)]
*  points to try to make a point. But if you look at the IMF data, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2838.7200000000003s)]
*  and I put it to you in the group chat, you can't just look at US [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2841.76s)]
*  Treasury securities, you have to look at actual absolute dollar [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2844.4s)]
*  reserves. And when you look at that over time, it hasn't [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2847.4s)]
*  fluctuated that much. And so for all the dopes that don't [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2849.92s)]
*  understand how this shit works, it's not just securities, it's [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2852.84s)]
*  actually also money. And the actual amount of US dollar money [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2855.76s)]
*  hasn't changed that much. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2860.2s)]
*  Gone between 60 and 70% since 1999 on this chart. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2862.08s)]
*  I just find this argument again, one of these long sigma [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2865.24s)]
*  arguments that are anxiety riddled, and I just don't want [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2869.2799999999997s)]
*  to waste my time thinking about it, because it'll distract me [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2872.12s)]
*  from winning on the field today. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2874.2799999999997s)]
*  You got to be able to block things out if you want to be a [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2876.3999999999996s)]
*  capital allocator. I agree. But an interesting discussion [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2878.2s)]
*  nonetheless. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2881.2s)]
*  I don't think these things are just noise. I think you're [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2882.04s)]
*  seeing a trend. I mean, look how many headlines are about the [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2884.56s)]
*  BRICS countries getting together and starting to transact [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2887.88s)]
*  in currencies other than dollars? [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2891.12s)]
*  Yeah, you know what, those are very cherry picked as well. And [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2893.2000000000003s)]
*  you said before, you don't trust the press. So you trust the [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2895.1600000000003s)]
*  press on these headlines all of a sudden. I don't think that [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2897.08s)]
*  that's actually [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2899.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't think anyone's disputing the fact that China and Saudi [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2900.7200000000003s)]
*  Arabia and China and Brazil are doing energy transactions in [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2903.92s)]
*  RMB. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2908.2400000000002s)]
*  I think it's very tiny. They're doing all putting all their [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2908.88s)]
*  money on venture capital in the West, private equity and the [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2911.2000000000003s)]
*  rest real estate in the West. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2913.52s)]
*  The Middle East. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2915.84s)]

*  It's like, I think they're trying to just let the US know [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2932.68s)]
*  like, hey, we have other options here. And I think it's China [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2935.7599999999998s)]
*  just trying to. It's China on their heels, trying to make [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2937.8399999999997s)]

*  I think you have a very accurate assessment of what China wants, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2956.96s)]
*  but it doesn't mean it's going to happen. And I think you have [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2959.52s)]
*  to make a bet. What do you think it's going to happen or not? I [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2961.68s)]
*  bet it's not going to happen. And I think reason I said, and [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2964.3599999999997s)]
*  I've said this before is China is in a demographic time bomb. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2966.52s)]

*  going to make these judgments. But I'm going to tell you [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2980.32s)]
*  practically speaking, as they are demographically imploding, [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2981.96s)]

*  that is just mathematical. And if you just again, you just have [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=2997.52s)]
*  to take a deep breath, look at the data and just extrapolate [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3001.24s)]
*  and you see, this is not a problem. China is not a problem. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3004.4799999999996s)]
*  China has real problems. There's no question about it. They've [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3008.0s)]

*  banking system. They've got a real estate bubble. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3013.04s)]
*  Startup problems. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3015.3999999999996s)]

*  They are. So there's no question that China has problems. But you [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3022.2799999999997s)]
*  want to talk about trends. There is a major trend in the world [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3026.12s)]
*  right now where, again, the BRICS countries Brazil, Russia, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3029.52s)]
*  India, China, South Africa, and you can put Saudi Arabia in that [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3033.48s)]

*  diversify off of the dollar. I'm not saying that the dollar is [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3040.52s)]

*  with you that there's no ready replacement at hand. But they are [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3046.36s)]
*  trying to do as many transactions they can off of the [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3050.6s)]

*  They tried to do one trade. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3067.48s)]
*  China and Saudi and China and [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3069.16s)]
*  No, Saudi and China talked about it. And they didn't do it. They [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3071.56s)]
*  talked about it. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3074.72s)]
*  Yeah, I would like to see data on that, not just a couple of [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3075.36s)]

*  What are you talking about? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3080.88s)]
*  Give us the data point. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3081.52s)]
*  The Brazil thing happened, but I think it was a small trade, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3082.16s)]
*  David. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3084.48s)]

*  You first were saying it didn't happen. And now you're saying [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3086.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm saying the Saudi Arabia China thing did not happen. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3088.64s)]
*  Your statement was they're trying to talk about many [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3092.24s)]
*  transactions as possible off the dollar. I don't think they're [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3093.96s)]

*  No, you're [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3105.16s)]

*  if they can. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3109.04s)]
*  No, I think Jason's saying you're right what they want to [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3109.8799999999997s)]
*  do, but what they are doing is what he's debating. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3112.04s)]
*  They're trying. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3114.3599999999997s)]
*  The Middle East is sending their money west. I don't think they're [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3114.8399999999997s)]
*  trying to send it east. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3118.04s)]
*  I don't think that's a good- [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3119.32s)]
*  Hold on a second. You're right that Saudi Arabia is investing [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3120.16s)]
*  in the US. They're, I'd say, highly diversified. That's a [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3123.8s)]
*  little different than what China is doing. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3127.2799999999997s)]
*  Yes, we're in agreement. China wants to get people off the US [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3130.6s)]
*  dollar. China's in decline. China's got big issues. We all [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3134.64s)]
*  agree on that. The Middle East has a lot of cash. I think if [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3137.2799999999997s)]
*  they're going to decide what to do with it, they'll appease [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3140.52s)]
*  China to have a solid relationship to Ship oil there. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3142.84s)]
*  But I think- [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3146.08s)]
*  China's the number one customer now. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3146.6s)]
*  China's number one customer. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3148.16s)]
*  And their hearts are in the west. That's where they're [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3148.72s)]
*  going to take China's money. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3150.96s)]
*  There's been a giant political realignment. Haven't you [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3151.96s)]
*  noticed? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3153.52s)]
*  I think the realignment is- [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3154.64s)]
*  The Chinese just negotiated- [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3156.08s)]
*  The Middle East becoming westernized and being accepted [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3156.96s)]
*  in the west and moving towards an investor in the west in [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3159.24s)]
*  technology. That's actually the trend. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3161.56s)]
*  The Chinese just negotiated or approached Ma between Saudi [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3163.16s)]
*  Arabia and Iran. Did you notice that? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3166.48s)]
*  That's- [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3169.68s)]
*  They also negotiated- [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3170.12s)]
*  I'm just talking about where they're putting their chips. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3171.52s)]
*  Yeah, but these things are all connected. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3172.84s)]
*  Where are they putting their chips? I think what you've [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3174.32s)]
*  explained, and I think we're in agreement, they'll sell their [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3176.36s)]
*  oil to China. Then what do they do with the bag? They take that [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3179.28s)]
*  same bag and they want to put it towards the west. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3182.1600000000003s)]
*  It's even worse. Again, the thing is, even if you settle a [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3184.48s)]
*  trade in the Yuan, I think you guys keep forgetting this key [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3187.4s)]
*  thing, which is the Yuan is pegged to the US dollar. So it [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3190.7200000000003s)]
*  is a proxy dollar. So if you really want to decouple, you [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3193.44s)]
*  first have to let this currency free float. They have no desire [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3197.6400000000003s)]
*  to let them do that, especially in a moment where they're [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3200.96s)]
*  economically imploding internally. So again, you go [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3203.1600000000003s)]
*  back to the circular argument where everything goes back to [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3205.72s)]
*  the dollar. So yes, they're saber rattling. Sax, I [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3208.24s)]
*  acknowledge what you're saying. I think you're totally right [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3210.9199999999996s)]
*  that they would love a free floating currency. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3213.0s)]
*  The Chinese would love. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3215.24s)]
*  Chinese and they want that free floating currency to not be [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3216.24s)]
*  pegged to the dollar. But right now, they have kept it pegged to [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3218.64s)]
*  the dollar. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3221.68s)]
*  So even if they do- [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3222.2799999999997s)]
*  I just googled that and it says not. It says- [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3223.2799999999997s)]
*  It is pegged. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3225.04s)]
*  I just googled, is Yuan pegged to USD? And it says the Chinese [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3225.7599999999998s)]
*  Yuan is not pegged to the US dollar. It was pegged from 94 to [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3229.56s)]
*  2005. But in 2005, China made its currency a floating exchange [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3232.88s)]
*  currency. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3236.28s)]
*  It is not a floating currency. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3236.92s)]
*  Yeah. And then do you trust that? Yeah. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3239.2400000000002s)]
*  Who's [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3240.8s)]
*  Well, I think it's highly manipulated. I agree with that. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3241.0s)]
*  But I don't think it's pegged. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3243.28s)]
*  It's not a floating currency. It is not a free floating currency. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3244.36s)]
*  China controls the exchange rate between themselves and the US [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3247.0s)]
*  dollar. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3250.6000000000004s)]
*  Let's move on. I think we've covered this. It'd be actually [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3251.04s)]
*  one thing that might be interesting to talk about. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3256.2000000000003s)]
*  You're just talking about reality. You have no basis for [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3257.6800000000003s)]
*  declaring that things like the moves that China is making with [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3259.3199999999997s)]
*  Brazil and Saudi Arabia, you're just declaring that to be fake [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3263.7599999999998s)]
*  news. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3266.0s)]
*  Nobody's saying fake news. We're saying it's happening, but it's [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3266.68s)]
*  probably minor. And it's probably more described as [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3268.96s)]
*  stable. What's your basis for believing that? [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3271.08s)]
*  Because we have no evidence to prove that it's occurring. We [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3273.2s)]
*  just have a couple of headlines and some small- I mean, where is [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3276.2s)]
*  it? I mean, all we're seeing is the money in Saudi Arabia is [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3279.96s)]
*  they're selling oil to China, correct. They're doing deals [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3284.3599999999997s)]
*  there. Then they're taking that money. And then they want to [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3287.08s)]
*  invest it in the West. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3289.88s)]
*  Who are you talking about? [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3291.0s)]
*  The other thing to keep in mind is that the Saudi real is pegged [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3291.96s)]
*  as well to the US dollar. And that's been there since I think [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3294.64s)]
*  the mid 80s. So China's is a very opaque manipulated currency [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3298.2s)]
*  market where they keep the dollar yuan spread quite fixed. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3303.08s)]
*  On the other side, Saudi has kept the same peg 3.75 to the [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3308.08s)]
*  dollar since the mid 80s. So again, it all just goes back to [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3311.64s)]
*  the US dollar. It's all proxies for the dollar. So there's some [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3314.88s)]
*  symbolic value, I suppose, in trading in yuan. But everything [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3317.04s)]
*  goes back to the dollar, because that's what it's measured in. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3320.96s)]
*  So it's not symbolic. What's happening is deeply geopolitical. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3323.48s)]
*  You've got a couple of things going on. One is that the US has [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3327.36s)]
*  now instituted sanctions on over 40 countries. Moreover, the whole [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3330.72s)]
*  world saw that in the case of Russia, we froze their foreign [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3335.88s)]
*  reserves, and basically seize the property of their oligarch. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3339.36s)]
*  So if you're an oligarch in the Middle East, you think you want [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3343.16s)]
*  to keep all of your money on all of your reserves in dollars, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3346.2s)]
*  you understand that the dollar has been weaponized as a [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3349.04s)]
*  political instrument in the United States. That's just a [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3351.12s)]
*  fact. So you're going to look to diversify, you're going to look [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3353.3599999999997s)]
*  to put your money in gold, you're going to look to put your [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3356.2799999999997s)]
*  money in other currencies. Is there like I said, a currency [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3357.96s)]
*  at hand that's ready to be a replacement for the US dollar? [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3361.12s)]
*  No, and it can't be the yuan. They don't have an open capital. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3364.16s)]
*  Where would you diversify? If you were the CIO? Where would you [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3368.48s)]
*  diversify? [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3372.0s)]
*  Well, what I would do if I were the Secretary of the Treasury [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3372.48s)]
*  of China, is I would say that, okay, for the exports, the US [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3376.44s)]
*  we're going to keep getting dollars, and we'll do something [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3381.68s)]
*  with those dollars. But for everybody else, we're going to [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3383.44s)]
*  try and do as many transactions and R&B as possible. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3385.96s)]
*  But what about the sellers of oil to China? What would they do? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3388.32s)]
*  They get R&B. So you would tell them to keep... [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3391.72s)]
*  Those are exactly the trades that we're talking about. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3394.12s)]
*  You tell them to hold R&B over US and euro. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3395.84s)]
*  China is seeking to pay Saudi Arabia and Brazil. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3398.72s)]
*  If you were the CIO, I do understand it. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3401.72s)]
*  Let me explain. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3403.9599999999996s)]
*  I do understand. What I'm asking you is, would you as CIO of [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3404.9599999999996s)]
*  Saudi or UAE, would you want to keep R&B? Would you want to keep [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3410.08s)]
*  euros or US dollars? Where would you want to keep your money? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3414.4399999999996s)]
*  And the question is, if they sell that, would they want to [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3417.68s)]
*  keep it in R&B? I don't think they would want to keep the [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3419.9199999999996s)]
*  yuan. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3421.8799999999997s)]
*  Honestly, to answer your question, I wouldn't put it in [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3422.2s)]
*  gold. That's where I would put it. I would. I put it in gold. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3424.3999999999996s)]
*  Okay, here's what China is proposing. Okay. They're saying [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3428.08s)]
*  to Saudi Arabia and Brazil, we're going to pay you for your [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3431.24s)]
*  oil in R&B. And then you are going to take the R&B and you [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3434.72s)]
*  can buy our products. Yeah, because again, we make [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3439.3999999999996s)]
*  everything. We're the factory of the world. And if you still have [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3442.3199999999997s)]
*  a surplus after that, you can settle that surplus in gold. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3445.52s)]
*  Because Beijing has a very liquid, you know, gold exchange [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3450.3199999999997s)]
*  market. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3453.68s)]
*  They're giving them Amazon gift cards. Here's your gift cards. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3454.12s)]
*  Yeah. Spend in our factories. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3456.64s)]
*  Two data points on the sacks that I just read. It's in this [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3459.32s)]
*  Barron's article that I included Nick, you may just want to link [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3462.2400000000002s)]
*  to it in the show notes, which I thought was pretty good. Swift, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3464.52s)]
*  which is sort of like the international payments backbone, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3466.96s)]
*  the share of yuan transactions briefly rose above 3%. In 2022, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3469.76s)]
*  that was the peak and it's now off 26%, down to about 2.2%. So [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3476.28s)]
*  actually, the share of yuan transactions has actually been [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3481.44s)]
*  shrinking in the last year. And then the second is that what [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3483.84s)]
*  this article states, which is interesting is that all the [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3486.88s)]
*  Belt and Road loans that China gave into all these developing [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3488.76s)]
*  countries in Africa, the Africans were like, we don't [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3492.0s)]
*  want this yuan. And so they just dollar swapped. And so now the [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3494.2400000000002s)]
*  BRI loans are all serviced in US dollars as well. So all the [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3497.48s)]
*  trillions of dollars China spent. I'm just saying that, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3500.28s)]
*  again, I'm not judging. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3503.32s)]
*  And their own alternative, Swift. We weaponize Swift as [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3504.28s)]
*  well. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3507.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, but Swift is still 98% of the of the world of how it works. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3507.96s)]
*  All I'm saying is, I just like to look, keep things simple. I [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3510.76s)]
*  think the US dollars here for a while, I think that debts suck. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3514.84s)]
*  I would love to have no deficits. But I also think these numbers [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3518.2400000000002s)]
*  are roughly like, we're playing plus or minus on the margin two [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3522.08s)]
*  to 300 basis points. We talked about that last week. And so I [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3525.32s)]
*  want to keep my brain open to the simple obvious things like, [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3529.08s)]
*  you know, selling. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3533.7200000000003s)]
*  That's what it's come to is CPG for you, Trimoth. You're like, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3536.6s)]
*  it's a down market CPG guy now. Yeah, that's where Trimoth's [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3539.28s)]
*  focused. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3542.4s)]
*  Why don't you pull Freeberg into this debate? I have one more [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3542.88s)]
*  point to make. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3545.0s)]
*  I'm Dr. Doom. Go ahead, Dr. Doom. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3546.08s)]
*  I think I'm not Dr. Doom. I'm just Dr. Reality, or at least I [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3547.64s)]
*  try to be I don't know, like there was a deal, you know, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3550.64s)]
*  China had a big visit with Brazil in March, we talked about [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3552.64s)]
*  it briefly, I shared a couple of these articles that covered the [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3556.3999999999996s)]
*  transactions, they signed $10 billion of trade agreements and [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3559.72s)]
*  cooperative agreements, all of which were meant to settle in [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3563.3199999999997s)]
*  yuan. Brazil's kind of made the statement that they're going to [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3566.0s)]
*  start to settle in local currency. And, you know, they're [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3569.04s)]
*  doing this multilateral trade program globally, with partners [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3573.04s)]
*  where they're going to trade and transact in local currencies, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3578.12s)]
*  they're not set to the dollar, they're not fixed to the dollar. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3581.32s)]
*  And I think that's just part of a general movement. I don't think [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3583.24s)]
*  it's about, hey, we got to get off the dollar as soon as [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3585.72s)]
*  possible. But I think it's about we could diversify. And there [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3587.7599999999998s)]
*  are other stable economies around the world, they might be [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3590.56s)]
*  having, you know, demographic issues or various economic [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3592.68s)]

*  everyone's got debt problems, demographic problems, over [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3600.28s)]
*  leverage problems, growth problems. And fundamentally, I [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3602.8s)]

*  that are going up the decoupling that's going on. Look, the United [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3735.88s)]

*  in America, but the Soviets basically opted out because they [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3749.84s)]

*  compelling part of the world economy. Then we had the [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3754.84s)]
*  unipolar world. So basically, for, you know, over half a [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3757.88s)]
*  century, we had this completely open system where there were no [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3762.1200000000003s)]
*  trade blocs in the world. Now we are seeing the rise of trade [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3765.1600000000003s)]
*  blocs with multipolarity. Yes, the US is pursuing a [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3768.96s)]
*  contradictory policy because on the one hand, yeah, hold on, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3773.36s)]
*  here's the contradiction. On the one hand, we run these massive [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3775.88s)]
*  deficits and debts. So we are a debtor nation who needs to make [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3779.52s)]
*  its debt attractive to debt holders or our interest rates [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3784.0s)]
*  going to keep going up. Okay, so that's on the one hand. On the [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3789.44s)]
*  other hand, we are doing things like weaponizing the dollar and [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3792.7200000000003s)]
*  weaponizing swift and imposing sanctions and engaging in [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3796.2s)]
*  geopolitical fights that are highly antagonistic to the [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3802.52s)]
*  nations that are our would be holders of our debt. So one of [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3807.0s)]
*  those two things has got to give either we reduce our debt and [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3812.2799999999997s)]
*  our deficits and the need we're remember we're not this is not [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3818.72s)]
*  a stable situation. We continue to issue. What is it somewhere [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3821.4399999999996s)]
*  between one and two trillion a year to government debt. So we [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3826.12s)]
*  have to constantly find more and more money out in the world to [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3830.52s)]
*  support our debt at the same time that we're weaponizing the [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3834.16s)]
*  dollar in the financial system, so that these sources of global [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3837.12s)]
*  capital don't want to participate. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3840.6s)]
*  And I agree with sex. This is why I think the disappointment to [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3842.0s)]
*  me is that there isn't bipartisan recognition of this [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3845.04s)]
*  being as severe as a war. It is the sort of thing that the [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3848.52s)]
*  government that both parties need to get behind and say, let's [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3852.3599999999997s)]
*  figure out a path to solving this problem. This is the [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3855.64s)]
*  objective. We've got to get our fiscal affairs in order. And [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3857.7999999999997s)]
*  then all the other stuff, the social stuff, the policy stuff, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3860.92s)]
*  we can fight about we can argue about later. But we have to put [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3863.96s)]
*  some gas in the tank, we have to be able to drive where we want [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=3866.92s)]

*  solve that problem. We're still winning on all these other [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4019.44s)]
*  dimensions. So why are we winning? That's not the [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4021.04s)]
*  conversation. Why is that federal government is different [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4022.56s)]
*  from us innovation. There's a difference. The federal [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4025.6s)]
*  government these are voters, voters elect to tax and spend. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4028.0s)]
*  And voters elect people to create a system that can legally [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4032.88s)]
*  go in and take assets and spend assets and borrow money. And [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4036.36s)]
*  we've done it in an extent now that is becoming almost a run [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4039.72s)]
*  away train. It is a problem. We saw the negative red chart that [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4042.84s)]
*  sacks had you pull up several times that has nothing to do [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4047.12s)]
*  with us dominance and fucking electronics and chips and biotech [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4049.96s)]
*  and all this other sort of stuff. We have a problem with how we [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4054.0800000000004s)]
*  spend money at the federal level. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4056.92s)]
*  I agree with that. I agree with that. That's the [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4058.32s)]
*  conversation that the dominance that we have in entrepreneurship [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4060.52s)]
*  and every one of these categories is what will pull us [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4063.88s)]
*  out of this. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4066.32s)]
*  The free enterprise system is a wonderful system that produces a [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4066.8s)]
*  lot of good prosperity for America. Okay, that's great. I [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4069.96s)]
*  agree with that. And it remains to be seen if China can sustain [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4074.52s)]
*  its remarkable economic growth that it's had over the last few [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4079.64s)]
*  decades. So that remains to be seen. However, the United [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4082.72s)]
*  States is behaving like a late stage empire. And that is [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4086.48s)]
*  separate from the system that got us here. We have [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4089.64s)]
*  unsustainable fiscal deficits, we spend way too much money that [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4093.92s)]
*  we don't have. We have an uncontrolled southern border, our [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4097.96s)]
*  cities are in decline. We've got hundreds of 1000s of people [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4101.0s)]
*  living on the streets. Have you seen it? We look like a third [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4105.08s)]
*  world country. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4107.64s)]
*  It's three or four cities that's- [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4109.4800000000005s)]
*  We are meddling in countries all over the world engaging in wars [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4111.8s)]
*  or proxy wars. We are behaving like a late stage empire. So [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4115.92s)]
*  JCal, it's true that the United States has a wonderful system. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4119.12s)]
*  And that's what got us here. It got us to unipolarity where we [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4122.6s)]
*  were the world's only superpower. But now we're in a [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4126.6s)]
*  world in which other countries are rising too. It's more [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4128.96s)]
*  multipolar. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4132.8s)]
*  Agreed. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4134.0s)]
*  And whether we continue our dominance will depend on whether [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4134.5199999999995s)]
*  we make the right decisions right now. And right now we are [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4138.16s)]
*  not making the right decisions. Adding two trillion to the debt [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4140.839999999999s)]
*  in peacetime a year makes no sense. Yeah, you're a little [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4143.5199999999995s)]
*  ran. It's like Wiley Coyote going off the cliff and [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4148.36s)]
*  pretending like if he just doesn't look down, there's [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4152.5199999999995s)]
*  nothing to worry about. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4154.679999999999s)]
*  I have said from the beginning, we need to get spending under [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4156.16s)]
*  control. But I am also incredibly enthusiastic about [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4158.36s)]
*  how we're performing in innovation and capitalism right [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4161.88s)]
*  now. It is off the charts how well this country is doing on [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4164.4800000000005s)]
*  those dimensions. Chamath, you have any thoughts while we wrap [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4167.08s)]
*  up this thing? [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4169.68s)]
*  No, I think we ended up conflating a bunch of issues [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4171.400000000001s)]
*  into one. I'll just say what I've said before, which is that [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4174.4800000000005s)]
*  the United States is kind of the simplest, safest bet and that [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4177.96s)]
*  these decisions are made on a relative basis. China, [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4181.68s)]
*  unfortunately for them, has a huge demographic problem that [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4187.400000000001s)]
*  will diminish them economically. And you're already starting to [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4191.24s)]
*  see it, but it's going to get really exacerbated in the next [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4195.639999999999s)]
*  10 or 15 years. That's just a mathematical reality for a [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4197.92s)]
*  country that has literally zero immigration and no solution. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4201.4s)]
*  Europe is not in a very great situation. And the only place [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4206.0s)]
*  that's really firing on all cylinders is India, but it has a [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4210.12s)]
*  long way to go to build the infrastructure that can really [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4212.719999999999s)]
*  scale and make it as predictable as United States. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4215.12s)]
*  Could it do it? I think so. But it's going to take a long time. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4218.28s)]
*  But, you know, 5060, 100 years of investment. So I don't know, I [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4220.72s)]
*  just kind of like try to simplify for myself, I think the US will [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4225.76s)]
*  be fine. I think the dollar will be fine. I don't think it's [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4228.400000000001s)]
*  right to spend this much. But I think that politicians are [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4232.56s)]
*  incapable of cutting expenses. And so I would like to cut their [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4234.76s)]
*  revenues. That's it. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4237.88s)]
*  It's a great discussion. Reberg. Yeah, I don't think you are [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4243.56s)]
*  respectful. I don't think you understand what the audience [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4245.72s)]
*  actually wants to hear. This is actually the core of the of the [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4247.6s)]
*  debate that we just had. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4251.160000000001s)]
*  Well, just do what Friedrich asked you, which is just to play [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4252.200000000001s)]
*  his clip in his words. And that's [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4254.4400000000005s)]
*  I have it right here. I think that the Saudi China trade if [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4256.92s)]
*  this happens, and oil is sold in one is the beginning of I think [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4259.04s)]
*  the end of the assumption that the US dollar is a global [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4264.0s)]
*  reserve. That's all. Yeah, that's what you said. That was [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4266.120000000001s)]
*  your prediction. That you said in the beginning of the end, you [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4270.72s)]
*  said it twice. So if you don't believe it's the beginning of [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4274.92s)]
*  the end, it's fine. The US dollar as a global reserve. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4276.8s)]
*  Yes, you believe that that it's the US dollar will not be the [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4279.2s)]
*  global reserve. You said it twice. Yeah. And I disagree. I [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4281.360000000001s)]
*  think there will be will remain the global reserve for our [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4286.360000000001s)]
*  lifetime. That's all. It's a fundamental difference. Let's [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4288.320000000001s)]
*  move on. Yes, I'm reticent to bring up the culture wars, but [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4292.92s)]
*  these have become prominent. So maybe we could have a meta [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4296.2s)]
*  discussion about these. There are three things going on one, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4299.24s)]
*  we touched on the book banning, I'm using air quotes there. And [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4303.92s)]
*  there's been a lot of feedback that's come in since then, just [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4309.12s)]
*  to follow up briefly on it. Books are not exactly being [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4312.2s)]
*  banned. It's a much more granular and nuanced issue. There [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4316.28s)]
*  was a bill 1467 that happened that Ron DeSantis did sign. They [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4320.4800000000005s)]
*  said that parents reasonably should get to see what's being [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4326.68s)]
*  put into classrooms. And as you might suspect, this is being done [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4329.84s)]
*  at a very local level. When you put all that control at the [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4335.92s)]
*  local level, you will have different constituents banned [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4338.64s)]
*  books that maybe shouldn't be some of them are obvious ones [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4342.92s)]
*  that were too graphic that I think most parents would agree [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4347.0s)]
*  shouldn't be in a school library. Other ones were horror [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4350.8s)]
*  books or young adult books, you can look at all this stuff, just [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4354.56s)]
*  search for pen banned books report, pen America. And if you [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4359.2s)]
*  there are instances of books that shouldn't be banned being [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4365.16s)]
*  banned and instances of books that we'd all agree on, but it [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4367.599999999999s)]
*  is not exactly book banning. It's letting each of the school [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4370.32s)]
*  districts make their own decisions, and they're not going [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4374.12s)]
*  to make perfect decisions when you put them out in the edges. So [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4376.08s)]
*  just to make that super clear, [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4378.4s)]
*  I think you're right to focus on the terminology here, because [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4379.8s)]
*  this is a question of what is put in the school library, that's [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4383.92s)]
*  it. So that's not a ban. Right. A ban would be if you couldn't [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4387.280000000001s)]
*  purchase the book for yourself for your kids. Any parent can [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4391.400000000001s)]
*  buy any book they want in Florida. We do have an issue I [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4394.84s)]
*  think with the curriculum, where really important classic books [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4397.96s)]
*  are being removed from the curriculum for political [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4403.360000000001s)]
*  reasons, mainly in California, books like To Kill a Mockingbird [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4405.56s)]
*  or Huck Finn. That was weird. They're being removed because [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4409.56s)]
*  they're being accused of being racist, even though the whole [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4412.5199999999995s)]
*  point of those books is to, I think, call it out, call it out [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4414.92s)]
*  and teach kids about racism. So there's a lot of stupid things [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4419.12s)]
*  happening from the left in terms of removing books from the [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4422.44s)]
*  curriculum, which I think is a much bigger deal than removing [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4425.599999999999s)]
*  books from a school library. There's also things happening [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4428.2s)]
*  with like, you know, Ian Fleming's James Bond books being [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4432.48s)]
*  rewritten, like posthumously because to be accused of sexism, [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4436.04s)]
*  accused of sexism, or Raw Dolls books are being posthumously [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4441.32s)]
*  edited. So like books are literally being rewritten in a [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4446.44s)]
*  way that their authors never intended that is positively [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4450.0s)]
*  Orwellian. That really is. That's really wrong. That's [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4452.72s)]
*  really wrong. Now on this on this DeSantis thing. I mean, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4457.68s)]
*  look, this is this is getting to the level now of being a hoax. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4461.28s)]
*  One of the stories going around is that there was this book of [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4464.72s)]
*  poetry, this totally innocuous book of poetry that was being [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4467.8s)]
*  banned in Florida. And I wanted to find out that. Yeah, so I [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4471.12s)]
*  wanted to find out the truth of it. Well, as it turns out, like [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4475.320000000001s)]
*  you said, J Cal, this is a Miami Dade school district. A decision [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4478.4800000000005s)]
*  was made this is not by DeSantis. This is made at the [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4482.96s)]
*  level of individual schools, [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4485.2s)]
*  which are voted on and their parents on the school boards. So [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4487.360000000001s)]
*  it's going to just follow the demographics and whatever that [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4490.4400000000005s)]
*  local community is. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4492.12s)]
*  Right. So basically, what happened is this this book of [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4493.68s)]
*  poetry was literally moved from the elementary school library to [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4496.0s)]
*  the middle school library. That's what happened. But all of [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4498.8s)]
*  a sudden, this was spun on social media, and by the [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4501.48s)]
*  mainstream media as if DeSantis had banned this book of poetry, [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4505.76s)]
*  to the point where Miami Dade school district had to put out a [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4509.72s)]
*  tweet correcting this. So it never banned or removed. It was [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4512.56s)]
*  just moved from one library to another. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4516.08s)]
*  I think this is a super interesting point, David, where [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4519.28s)]
*  you and I are in agreement, you and I are both for freedom of [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4521.32s)]
*  speech, and we're big advocates of that. And then there are [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4524.04s)]
*  decisions. And you could reasonably make this decision, [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4527.64s)]
*  hey, let the parents decide. Great. When you let the parents [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4530.6s)]
*  decide, you have to take into account that these school boards [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4533.64s)]
*  could be hijacked by different groups of people, or they could [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4537.04s)]
*  be very small, monocultures of, you know, little towns or cities. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4539.64s)]
*  Here's the list, by the way, if anybody wants to look at this, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4544.32s)]
*  you can actually look at the very granular list, pen America [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4546.64s)]
*  keeps an index of all these, I put the thing in the chat here, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4549.2s)]
*  and you'll see things in left, right, everybody in between, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4551.64s)]
*  some places are banning all the LGBTQ books, some are banning [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4556.280000000001s)]
*  the critical race books or books by people of color, other ones [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4559.4800000000005s)]
*  are banning, you know, the James Bond novels, etc. So it's it's [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4563.68s)]
*  a free for all of parents executing their rights at a very [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4567.56s)]
*  local level. And, you know, I guess if you want parents to [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4570.56s)]
*  have a say in their schools, it's going to be slightly [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4574.92s)]
*  imperfect and variable. But it's not like censorship going [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4577.4s)]
*  on, but there is censorship going on, I guess, in some ways, [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4582.12s)]
*  the political question is, do you allow government bureaucrats [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4584.719999999999s)]
*  to dictate to parents what their kids are going to see or have [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4590.08s)]
*  access to? And I don't think that's viable. I mean, look, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4593.28s)]
*  parents could take their kids out of the school and homeschool [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4598.5199999999995s)]
*  them if they wanted. Yes. So at the end of the day, so they have [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4601.24s)]
*  that right. So why would you deny parents the right to [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4604.4s)]
*  determine what's in the school library? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4608.04s)]
*  And it does seem like all of this goes by the way, some of [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4610.719999999999s)]
*  these books that have been removed are actually Lord of [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4613.679999999999s)]
*  the Flies. Yeah, Lord of the Flies will probably get [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4616.5199999999995s)]
*  removed because they don't like somebody being labeled fat [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4618.96s)]
*  piggy. No, no, I'm saying right, like there are some great books [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4621.4s)]
*  that were written in an age where, you know, you just say [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4628.639999999999s)]
*  things in a certain way that aren't meant to be offensive. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4633.2s)]
*  But these books are very powerful. And I don't know about [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4635.44s)]
*  you guys, but I had a bunch of books that I read when I was [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4638.32s)]
*  younger, that had a huge impact on me. And then I don't want [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4640.44s)]
*  those books getting removed from the curriculum. You're right, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4644.88s)]
*  Lord of the Flies. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4646.44s)]
*  Incredible. Mockingbird. Those are all important books that I [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4648.32s)]
*  read as part of the curriculum. But all we're talking about, I [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4650.76s)]
*  think is this even this very minor issue of what's in the [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4653.36s)]
*  library, obviously, the parents should get to the side. And some [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4656.08s)]
*  of the things that have been removed from the library are [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4658.92s)]
*  pretty out there. Like, for example, there was one book that [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4660.76s)]
*  was educating kids on like, how to get a grinder date, which [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4664.92s)]
*  they're not even supposed to be able to do right like grinders [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4670.2s)]
*  for 18 and up. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4672.280000000001s)]
*  There are other topics that like suicide and harm and other [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4673.6s)]
*  ones. When do you introduce that to a child? Is that something [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4678.280000000001s)]
*  that's third grade or, you know, a suicide discussion? When [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4680.92s)]
*  should that reasonably occur? [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4683.72s)]
*  This is a crazy question. But I'll ask it to you guys. I would [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4684.76s)]
*  rather Lord of the Flies be removed from a library than [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4687.12s)]
*  edited because then at least there's a different place where [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4691.96s)]
*  you can get the original book. Oh, for sure. The idea of [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4694.24s)]
*  editing a book is so insane. It's so mind control. Yeah, it's [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4697.4s)]
*  really bad. That idea is very, very bad because you're reading [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4702.24s)]
*  something thinking that this is what the author intended. And [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4705.96s)]
*  all of a sudden, it's manipulated by some rando false [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4710.68s)]
*  expert under some guys that you had no decision making in. That's [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4713.32s)]
*  really bad. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4717.759999999999s)]
*  What's really, I think, important of this discussion is [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4718.96s)]
*  what's how the press frame something how politicians frame [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4722.32s)]
*  them and then how they're actually executed on the ground [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4725.32s)]
*  can be very different. So this has become a raw shock test for [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4727.5599999999995s)]
*  what cause you back. And when you actually look at just the [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4730.639999999999s)]
*  list, you'll see people in California, people in Colorado [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4734.719999999999s)]
*  banning quote unquote banning, or just not including certain [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4738.16s)]
*  books and libraries. It's parents having age old debates [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4741.0s)]
*  about when do you introduce certain topics to your kids? [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4744.04s)]
*  That's your job as a parent. What happens in the library is [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4746.68s)]
*  going to be variable. All right, Nvidia is going for vertical [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4749.76s)]
*  integration, they unveiled their GPU CPU super chip called Grace [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4753.28s)]
*  Hopper, after the Navy Admiral, obviously, Nvidia grace, GPU is [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4756.28s)]
*  a 72 arm, your version v2 CPU cores, whatever that means, the [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4760.28s)]
*  CPU can deliver up to 370 score on a spec crate 2017 in base, [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4764.44s)]
*  whatever that means. I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with all the [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4769.56s)]
*  benchmark technical is the peak of humor on the show. Listen, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4774.0s)]
*  we're talking about Pentium chips, I could have kept up [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4778.84s)]
*  here. But I haven't kept up with this since the 90s. We're [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4780.84s)]
*  talking about the Intel inside Pentium chips. Yes, I could. I [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4783.6s)]
*  did keep up with chip stuff. I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah, no, I mean, [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4786.6s)]
*  when we got past gigabit, I stopped. I think what's really [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4792.4400000000005s)]
*  interesting here is this is a really important moment where [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4795.080000000001s)]
*  that design that Grace Hopper design, which is basically a [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4798.8s)]
*  massive system on chip, it's an entire rig, it's a GPU and CPU [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4802.96s)]
*  and memory and interconnects. This is like them going for the [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4806.360000000001s)]
*  jugular. This is what's crazy in a moment like this, like that is [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4809.4400000000005s)]
*  basically them trying to create an absolute monopoly. Because if [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4813.320000000001s)]
*  you have these rigs, and these rigs are the most capable for [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4817.200000000001s)]
*  learning, and you have their SDK CUDA, which is becoming the [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4821.240000000001s)]
*  de facto software layer now that you use to write to their H [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4825.320000000001s)]
*  100s, or Grace Hopper when it's available, and the 100s, that [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4828.24s)]
*  could create a level of lock in that I think people should be [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4832.92s)]
*  thinking about. So if you're the hyperscalers, like Amazon and [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4836.36s)]
*  Google and Microsoft, what is your reaction to this? If you're [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4839.08s)]
*  Facebook, what is your reaction to this? And I think it's really [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4843.0s)]
*  important, because if these guys continue to innovate at this [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4846.92s)]
*  scale, you're not going to have any alternatives. And it comes, [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4849.679999999999s)]
*  it goes back to like what Intel looked like back in the day, [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4853.48s)]
*  which is an absolute straight up monopoly, except the [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4856.5599999999995s)]
*  differences that even when you wrote something to Intel CPUs, [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4859.0s)]
*  you could actually run it on an AMD processor, and it would work [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4864.16s)]
*  with no changes. But that's not necessarily the same. So if you [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4867.32s)]
*  go from an A 100 to something else, an FPGA or some other [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4872.32s)]
*  silicon, you have to translate the model. And so it's very [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4876.76s)]
*  important to understand that there's no extensibility here. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4880.76s)]
*  So like if Nvidia continues to drive this quickly and, and [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4882.88s)]
*  continues to execute like this, it's a one and done one company [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4886.72s)]
*  monopoly in AI at the hardware layer. And I think that that [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4891.64s)]
*  people are probably thinking about how to blunt that [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4894.76s)]
*  competitive outcome. But that's what I took away from that, from [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4897.88s)]
*  that announcement from them, which is like, they are ready to [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4902.6s)]
*  go for the jugular here in what looks like the most important [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4905.6s)]
*  market that's emerged in like [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4908.24s)]
*  the valuation to moth trading at 200 times or 50 times. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4911.12s)]
*  The simple thing about price to equity ratios is if you take the [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4916.52s)]
*  price equity ratio and you invert it, that's your implied [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4919.04s)]
*  earnings, price earnings, price earnings, sorry, and you invert [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4922.8s)]
*  it, that's your yield, right. And so Nvidia is yielding at [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4925.76s)]
*  these prices. I think it's somewhere like two to two and a [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4930.96s)]
*  half percent, which is less than and it's almost half of a [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4934.08s)]
*  typical two year bond. And so when you have a yield that [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4938.36s)]
*  that's low, you have to see it just grow absolutely massively. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4942.12s)]
*  But there's this principle in capitalism, which is in order to [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4946.48s)]
*  grow like that, you're generating so much profit, that [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4949.92s)]
*  competitors look at it and say, hold on, you don't deserve that [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4953.96s)]
*  much profit, I'm going to take some of that. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4956.5599999999995s)]
*  Your profit is my opportunity, your margins my opportunity. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4958.28s)]
*  I think that your margin is my opportunity is exactly what [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4961.12s)]
*  happens. So I think what I'm waiting for Friedberg is like in [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4963.839999999999s)]
*  the next two quarters, if AMD, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4966.92s)]
*  Amazon don't announce something substantive, there's a very [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4971.96s)]
*  good chance that Nvidia runs away with this. And I think that [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4976.96s)]
*  that's very problematic. But in that case, that price is cheap. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4980.84s)]
*  My bet, though, it's a different version of your bet, but we get [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4985.96s)]
*  to the same outcome is that I don't think that that's going to [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4989.4s)]
*  happen because it's just too important. And so I think that [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4991.4400000000005s)]
*  everybody, other than Nvidia, wants vendor diversity, right? [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4994.84s)]
*  You don't want to get locked into one person, one set of [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=4999.040000000001s)]
*  hardware, or one cloud, you know, one SDK, you don't want [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5002.64s)]
*  that nobody wants that except Nvidia, and Nvidia shareholders. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5006.080000000001s)]
*  So my bet is in the next two quarters, you start to see some [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5010.400000000001s)]
*  real action so that folks start to have to balance their [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5012.88s)]
*  forecasts, where it's not just 100% Nvidia, but it's Nvidia [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5016.64s)]
*  plus plus plus. And that's sort of what I would bet. Because it [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5020.52s)]
*  just seems like logical and right. Because I otherwise it [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5026.040000000001s)]
*  would it would be pretty derelict of these hyperscalers [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5029.6s)]
*  to just throw their hands in the air and just give the whole [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5032.4400000000005s)]
*  market to them. And it would be derelict of AMD. The other thing [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5034.76s)]
*  that's happening is, and you know, AMD is AMD is a great [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5037.4400000000005s)]
*  memory solution. But they really don't have a deterministic AI [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5040.56s)]
*  chip. And I think that Lisa Su needs to get needs to act [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5043.84s)]
*  decisively here and build something, announce something, [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5047.0s)]
*  buy something, but she needs to be really aggressive here. If [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5050.12s)]
*  you look at the language models, a lot of them are taking less [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5054.16s)]
*  and less CPU GPU to actually build them. So this has been [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5058.36s)]
*  like a bit of a race or a competition on hugging face. I [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5062.32s)]
*  showed the leaderboard on another episode, maybe two [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5066.5599999999995s)]
*  episodes ago, but I've been talking to some of the people [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5068.5599999999995s)]
*  who are doing these language models to mouth and they said [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5070.4s)]
*  there's massive inefficiency. And so yeah, and by the way, the [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5072.48s)]
*  other thing I mentioned, J Cal is also happening, which is like [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5076.12s)]
*  the free break you talked about this, the atomization of these [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5079.4s)]
*  models is happening, I think even faster than when you first [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5081.68s)]
*  brought that up. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5085.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, so what took two or $3 million last year is now taking [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5086.76s)]
*  $200,000 just through software improvements and code [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5090.04s)]
*  improvements crazy. And now they're thinking a number of the [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5092.88s)]
*  other thing people are coming to is because of so much what's the [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5097.4s)]
*  term hallucinations that people are using because of the [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5100.04s)]
*  hallucinations, people are making narrower models that are [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5101.96s)]
*  deeper in legal or just, you know, stack overflow, just core [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5104.88s)]
*  or just a vertical and core, they take less GPU, but they get [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5108.92s)]
*  better results because you've constrained the data set. And [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5112.28s)]
*  that's resulting in, you know, better outcomes. So I think this [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5115.6s)]
*  could also be where maybe people don't need as much GPU or CPU [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5119.56s)]
*  at the same time, so many people are going after it. So that could [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5123.32s)]
*  flip where the demand could actually decrease because of [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5125.6s)]
*  software efficiencies or hitting some benchmark that's reasonable [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5129.68s)]
*  enough. What do you think? Friedberg? [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5132.92s)]
*  Look, I think as performance improves, as cost declines, like [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5135.4s)]
*  any economic model, there's a pretty nonlinear relationship [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5140.0s)]
*  with demand. So we'll find new ways to apply this technology, I [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5143.0s)]
*  think the demand is only going to go nonlinear. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5148.16s)]
*  The other thing that's happening is people are starting to build [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5152.08s)]
*  like mosaic ml. They're building cloud independent models. So you [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5154.44s)]
*  can take the same model, build it on your own proprietary [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5159.5599999999995s)]
*  personal cloud, not educate chat, cheap, e24, not educate [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5162.44s)]
*  Bard, but do it with your own model. And then you can move it [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5165.4s)]
*  from Azure. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5170.32s)]
*  Reduction and fine tuning seems to like, get to the point that we [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5171.16s)]
*  can run these things on small machines, cheaply quickly. And [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5176.08s)]
*  it just, it'll change the it'll change the applications. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5183.0s)]
*  You're saying run inference, cheaper, not run training. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5185.879999999999s)]
*  Run inference. That's right. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5189.280000000001s)]
*  Oh, no, this is not good. Biden just had a big fall on stage at [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5191.320000000001s)]
*  the US Air Force Academy graduation. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5195.72s)]
*  Oh, no, I think he'll be okay. But whoa, it's not like he fell [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5198.360000000001s)]
*  off the stage. He just tried to [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5202.2s)]
*  Oh, it doesn't doesn't look good. But he could have broke [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5204.72s)]
*  something. Well, hope he's okay. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5206.76s)]
*  I hope he's okay. Yeah. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5208.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, we just had this whole talk about it. Yeah. I mean, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5210.08s)]
*  it's just again, I think like physical like these kinds of [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5211.88s)]
*  physical things are, are normal. And I think people need to be [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5214.2s)]
*  much more empathetic about that kind of stuff. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5217.2s)]
*  I mean, he was riding a bike over the summer last year. I [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5219.08s)]
*  remember. And he looked great. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5221.24s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, FDR was in a wheelchair. So I don't care [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5223.32s)]
*  about that. All I care about is mental acuity. Yeah, me too. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5227.28s)]
*  He's okay. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5230.72s)]
*  By the way, I want him to be well enough to run because I'm [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5231.32s)]
*  scared of some of the other Democratic candidates they might [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5234.88s)]
*  put up. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5237.639999999999s)]
*  Same. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5238.16s)]
*  No. Like, I don't want to get a president Newsom or a president [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5238.48s)]
*  Harris. I mean, I don't think Biden is very good. But I think [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5243.32s)]
*  he's better than Harris or Newsom. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5246.84s)]
*  Biden drops out who's the lead candidate in your mind? [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5249.04s)]
*  RFK. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5251.96s)]
*  Really? Wow. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5253.4400000000005s)]
*  I would prefer RFK to Biden. But I think what will happen if [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5254.68s)]
*  Biden drops out is we'll get a flood of establishment Democrat [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5257.88s)]
*  candidates in the race. Newsom, maybe JB Pritzker, Harris for [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5261.2s)]
*  sure. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5265.4800000000005s)]
*  There's a lot of differences between the left and the right. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5266.24s)]
*  But the one similarity is that there's a large amount of voters [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5268.32s)]
*  in both of those blocks who don't fundamentally like these [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5271.64s)]
*  establishment candidates. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5274.92s)]
*  And I think that that sentiment is exactly the same. And so you [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5276.44s)]
*  know, you can have a pro Trump wave on the right, just like you [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5279.639999999999s)]
*  could have a pro RFK wave on the left. And they are solidified by [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5282.36s)]
*  the same idea, which is, I think you're going to see more and [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5286.639999999999s)]
*  more outsiders have a chance through the nomination process [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5289.2s)]
*  to get in. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5292.5599999999995s)]
*  I think the Don't Care Party will stop it. I mean, they [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5294.5599999999995s)]
*  should have Bernie Sanders, remember that? It was Sanders [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5296.719999999999s)]
*  against Hillary Clinton. And they... [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5299.719999999999s)]
*  They shivved him. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5303.08s)]
*  They shivved him. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5303.96s)]
*  They rigged the primary against him. Wait, am I allowed to use [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5305.32s)]
*  that word? [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5308.16s)]
*  Oh, they just labeled the episode. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5309.64s)]
*  No, but look, I mean, the establishment has, in the [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5315.52s)]
*  Democratic Party, has a huge influence over the outcome [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5319.28s)]
*  because they control the superdelegates, right? They'll [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5322.16s)]
*  never... [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5324.6s)]
*  Wouldn't Newsom supercharge the Republican base? I mean, being [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5325.04s)]
*  like a coastal elite, and what's happened with San Francisco and [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5329.16s)]
*  LA, I think that just drives out the Trump voters in a massive [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5332.32s)]
*  way that... [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5335.28s)]
*  I said like over a year ago, I thought that the 2024 would be a [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5335.679999999999s)]
*  Newsom DeSantis race. I still think there's like a 10, 20% [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5340.719999999999s)]
*  chance of that. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5344.04s)]
*  Wow, that would be wild. Be wild. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5346.0s)]
*  Maybe 10%. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5348.5199999999995s)]
*  What about Joe Manchin? What's the story there? Anybody have any [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5350.32s)]
*  insights on Joe Manchin? [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5353.16s)]
*  We had a phenomenal dinner at my house last week. He is so [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5355.0s)]
*  charming. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5358.24s)]
*  Okay. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5359.04s)]
*  So what do you need this? What are you talking about? [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5359.36s)]
*  I don't know if you publicly disclosed it. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5361.68s)]
*  Well, it's already happened. We had a fabulous dinner and he met [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5363.88s)]
*  a lot of people here and he's amazing. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5368.88s)]
*  Did Sachs come to that? [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5372.88s)]
*  And Heather's amazing. Heather's amazing too. His daughter, who [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5373.72s)]
*  she ran, I think it was Mylan, pharmaceutical, incredible [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5378.6s)]
*  executive. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5381.6s)]
*  Joe Manchin would jump in, yeah? You think, Tramont? [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5383.360000000001s)]
*  Manchin's fabulous. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5385.68s)]
*  If Biden wasn't in, Joe Manchin would jump in, you think? [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5386.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5389.16s)]
*  Percentage two? [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5389.96s)]
*  I don't want to speculate any on anything like that. But I think [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5390.64s)]
*  he's I think he's an amazing American patriot. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5392.92s)]
*  Is that your guy, Freiburg? Would you go Joe Manchin? Because [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5396.64s)]
*  he wants to control spending? [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5398.72s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know enough. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5402.240000000001s)]
*  All right. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5404.04s)]
*  I'll tell you one of the reasons why I like RFK Jr. is that I [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5404.76s)]
*  mean, there's so many issues that he is deviating from [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5408.52s)]
*  Democratic Party orthodoxy. He's in favor of free speech and [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5410.96s)]
*  against censorship. He's in favor of civil liberties and [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5413.92s)]
*  against this like massive surveillance state that we've [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5416.76s)]
*  created. And our foreign policy wants to end all the crazy wars. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5419.44s)]
*  And I would say that of all the candidates I've heard, he [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5423.08s)]
*  understands the situation in Ukraine the most deeply. Now [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5426.44s)]
*  both Trump and DeSantis have called for a ceasefire and [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5430.0s)]
*  that's good. And I think RFK would work towards a ceasefire [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5433.879999999999s)]
*  too. But RFK Jr. goes deeper and explains how the whole situation [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5438.12s)]
*  Ukraine came about. And so he understands it very deeply. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5442.96s)]
*  All right, folks, there you have it. Another episode of The [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5446.839999999999s)]
*  Darling podcast for the dictator, the architect David [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5449.36s)]
*  Sachs and [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5453.5199999999995s)]
*  Kingmaker. No, he's [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5456.679999999999s)]
*  like architect better than Kingmaker. Sure. Kingmaker. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5458.5199999999995s)]
*  You like architect or Kingmaker? It's crazy. The whole thing was [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5463.28s)]
*  this like made up. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5466.5599999999995s)]
*  No, but I know but as a nickname, which one do you [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5467.2s)]
*  prefer architect do you prefer? [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5469.88s)]
*  Okay, what are the articles say? Kingmaker? [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5472.16s)]
*  The article is a Kingmaker. I said architect. I think [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5474.679999999999s)]
*  architect is more Schvendale. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5476.48s)]
*  The article is about a call that never happened. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5478.2s)]
*  With a person you don't know? [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5481.08s)]
*  With a person I don't know. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5482.16s)]
*  Right. Okay, that aside, what, what nickname would you like us [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5485.16s)]
*  to use going forward? Kingmaker? [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5488.96s)]
*  Putting aside that the whole article was made up. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5490.56s)]
*  Yes, putting that aside. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5493.16s)]
*  Architect? [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5494.64s)]
*  Can I go with Kingmaker? I like Kingmaker. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5495.36s)]
*  I like architect. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5497.08s)]
*  But it's so silly. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5498.72s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, please tell us which one. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5499.88s)]
*  Yeah, Secretary of State. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5502.08s)]
*  Look, I'm a mid level donor. Mid at best. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5503.24s)]
*  You're mid? [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5508.0s)]
*  Mid at best. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5508.84s)]
*  Some reddits are going crazy right now. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5510.48s)]
*  And then influencer, I'm mid at best. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5513.4s)]
*  So I'm a [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5516.2s)]
*  Secretary of State? [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5516.8s)]
*  I'm mid mid. However, it's true that there are very few [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5518.2s)]
*  podcasters who probably donated anything. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5522.28s)]
*  You could be yeah. Henry Kissinger and Madeleine Albright, [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5523.96s)]
*  highest ranking foreign born citizens to lead. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5527.599999999999s)]
*  Yes, I think that you would be an exceptional Secretary of [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5530.16s)]
*  State. I'm just going to put that up there. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5532.72s)]
*  You could be Secretary of State. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5533.72s)]
*  Cabinet member? [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5535.280000000001s)]
*  I think you would kick ass. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5535.8s)]
*  Because you have the intellectual firepower to [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5538.320000000001s)]
*  actually not get bamboozled on this stuff. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5540.320000000001s)]
*  You'd hold your ground. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5542.16s)]
*  You know who actually I think was pretty good on on foreign [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5543.280000000001s)]
*  policy doesn't get any credit was was Jared Kushner. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5545.76s)]
*  I was listening to an interview with him. And this happened like [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5549.64s)]
*  eight months ago, and he was describing the whole situation [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5553.84s)]
*  Ukraine. And he says very clearly that he and Trump [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5556.2s)]
*  understood that bringing Ukraine into NATO was a red line for [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5560.6s)]
*  the Russians, and they never went there. So they armed [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5564.0s)]
*  Ukraine, but they were very careful to not make any [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5567.320000000001s)]
*  statements about Ukraine coming into NATO. He understood that [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5570.52s)]
*  that was a serious provocation. I'll post the interview in the [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5574.04s)]
*  chat. But it was with I think Gerard Baker from the Wall Street [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5577.280000000001s)]
*  Journal. So Jared understood the situation better than most of [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5582.04s)]
*  these, you know, foreign policy elite establishment types who [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5584.96s)]
*  don't understand how their actions can be perceived as [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5590.16s)]
*  provocative by the other side. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5593.0s)]
*  Well, he he's sure secured the bag after getting out of that [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5595.08s)]
*  gig. Two billion. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5598.44s)]
*  And he got the Abraham Accords done. And now binds this flush [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5600.28s)]
*  out down the toilet because he's alienated the Saudis so much. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5604.599999999999s)]
*  They've gone to the Chinese. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5606.96s)]
*  I mean, the fact that there's flights between Israel and the [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5609.12s)]
*  Middle East nations now and they seem to have a common. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5611.92s)]
*  It's pretty awesome. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5616.44s)]
*  I don't think you understand how much Biden has alienated the [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5617.5199999999995s)]
*  Saudis. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5620.639999999999s)]
*  I shake Biden wouldn't shake the man's hand. What was the point [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5622.599999999999s)]
*  of that? [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5625.88s)]
*  I'm not in favor of what was that like a fist bump or pre [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5626.759999999999s)]
*  negotiated fist bump? Yeah, it's a little how insulting is that [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5631.5599999999995s)]
*  the one thing I loved about Trump was he was willing to meet [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5634.96s)]
*  with anybody. My idea of foreign policy is meet with as many [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5637.24s)]
*  people as possible, as often as possible, and not go to war. I [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5640.24s)]
*  would meet with Kim Jong Un, Putin, Xi Jinping on the [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5644.24s)]
*  regular, every country we should be with, because that's how [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5648.32s)]
*  progress gets me not meeting with him is Yeah, I mean, it's [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5651.2s)]
*  not a reward. I think there's a part of this military industrial [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5655.24s)]
*  complex that believes a meeting with the president is a reward [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5660.76s)]
*  or an endorsement of the worst things anybody's ever done. It's [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5664.44s)]
*  not. It's a meeting to try to make the world safer, or to try [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5668.2s)]
*  to build common ground. And so that is not me or Jim Cramer, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5672.2s)]
*  however you want to try to frame it. It's intelligent. And I'm [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5676.04s)]
*  for intelligent foreign policy, which is talking to people. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUDG1FB03A&t=5681.0s)]
